   I live in KOREA. I bought a Sony mobile phone to this seller.  The cell phone delivered to me was a completely broken phone. This product doesn't charge at all!!! In addition I could not send it to U.S.A. from Korea. Because the built-in battery can not pass through the airport search. I have to throw away this phone!! I have to give up over $ 200 and throw away the phone!!! I can not understand why the seller did not do the basic inspection!  Be very careful when you buy this seller's products. You may have to throw away more than $ 200 like me...   	0

   Never ricived it	0
   Nice phone even though it has been around for awhile. Has 16 GB sd card slot and comes with all the standard features. Love to watch movies and view photos on it as the resolution is very good. The overall price was average for a phone of this age however the phone works well for the price. It takes good videos and pictures. Can not complain about it at all. Had to replace the screen as it was cracked which was fairly easy to do with minimal cost to me. Samsung has great products as I have an old phone from them that is over 5 years old and still working. Can't beat that.  I love it really and it is good enough for me.	1

"  As of this review there are Note 5's on the market. Picked up a new Note 3 for less than 1/2 the cost of the newest model. At less then $300 buying the phone outright is better than making payments to a carrier in my opinion.    I like the big screen on this phone. It's easier to read text, watch videos, and view images. The S-pen makes it easy and fast to interact with the phone's many features.   If your primary needs are for text and phone this Note 3 is probably more than you'd need.    If you want an easy to view screen combined with features of a notepad this Samsung is a good choice."	1
  Budget phone but offers a lot of higher end features.. Nice phone easy to use.	1

"  I had to upgrade to an iPhone 6 when my old iPhone 5 got wrecked. I purchased a like-new iPhone 5 online only to discover that Verizon won't activate it. Apparently a recent move to bump sales of newer phones. At any rate, I bought this iPhone 6s on ebay from a good seller. I like the fingerprint ID. The somewhat larger display is also helpful. Well-spent $175."	1
"  I liked the features of the original and to a degree this replacement.  However: (1) battery would drain in a matter of hours, (2) phone would reboot at random even when in use, (3) Contacts would be deleted at random, (4) I was informed the Seller does not offer a return policy (bummer), (5) calls would be dropped at random."	0

" Coming from a  LG G4 I wanted to have a smaller but powerful phone. Reviews were singing odes about this phone so I gave it a chance. The fingerprint button is a nightmare, never relly worked so I turned off. (Moto phones have amazing fingerprint buttons). Battery life is horrible and can get really hot. That was the biggest issue. A LG phone is so tweakable, e.g. dark keyboard which I always prefer or even the icons. On the S5 nothing: bright white keyboard and outdated childish looking icons.  So I dumped it and bought a much cheaper moto phone. Voila: superb battery life (2 days insted of 5 hrs), the best fingerprint scan, dark keyboard and beautiful business looking icons. "	0

 I am very happy with this iPhone 7.  It was rated a 9 out of 10 but I saw nothing wrong with it. I think it is a very good value. 	1
 I asked for the seller to send pictures of the phone turned on because the picture he posted looked fake and he sent a pic. after doing some research I find the SAME pictures online.!!! I posted the picture he sent and the searched up one as well. would not recommend spending your money here.	0

" I bought a S8+ from mdetector and it was advertised as being In good shape. After losing out on bidding somehow I was the top bidder, that should have been my 1st sign. Next I tried emailing the seller asking if there were any blemishes that weren't visible on the pics and did not get a response. So I tried email again still no response. Now I was ?ing things. Then I get the phone in the mail. So I look over the package and it doesn't look damaged, next I start opening it up.  Pull out the phone and it was cracked on the corner, pretty obvious crack. So I email the seller for the 3rd time and then the seller finally replies and says the phone was fine when it was sent. Then offers me 100 once I send the phone back. Pretty funny since the box wasn't damaged and there was no evidence of glass in the package. Pretty sad people are still trying to scam people. Why can't people just be honest anymore? So watch out for mdetector trying to sell anything. "	0

I have already requested a refund and to send this back.

 I liked this phone because it does not have AT&T's software on the device but the Seller sent with a PIN that could not be unlocked so I had to return it.

" purchased a Sony Xperia Z3 compact one month ago from Amazon with Warranty. Liked the phone and the features.  Today  I went to the hardware store. And then drove to my siste""s house.  I deceided to text her that I was there and ready to paint her garage.    I could not swipe the top of the screen.  Noticed a crack in upper left hand corner.  The phone is in an aluminum framed case and is covered from day one with tempered glass screen protectors.  The screen protector is undamaged.  The phone has never been dropped or sat on.  I carry the phone in the side pocket of my carpenter pants. Take it out when I get to my destination.   I contacted Sony support chat online for warranty repair.  Spoke to a Jason.  After he asks me  a bunch of questions even though I started the chat with information I gave above.  Then tells me I'm sorry, Sony does not cover this kind of damage.   I will never buy a Sony product again.  Sony should be ashamed and dishonored.  You have been warned.  Look else where for your electronics."	0

" The ad said that the phone had ""issues"".  The back of the phone was missing so I couldn't use it.   I just threw it away and was forced to buy another one because the back was what I needed.     What good is a phone without a back?"	0
" The Bad: 1.) The Robin speaker likes to crackle a lot on calls, with the internal speaker, but also when used on speaker phone (and very badly in that case). Uncertain if android bug, or problem with Robin. 2.) Microphone seems poorly placed or something. Many people cannot hear me unless I take my ear away from the speaker and move my mouth down right over the Mic. I've also had issues where the mic stopped working randomly (and it is not on mute), then randomly began working again. 3.) Structurally the Robin is not very durable, if you watch any of the Bend Tests online, it snaps right in half. This is worrying, but at the same time, I don't make a habit of bending my phones violently. 4.) Type C usb is good but also bad because it means if you want two charge cords, prepare to spend $50, unless you'd like to fry your phone as Benson warns of.  5.) No USB OTG support 6.) No MicroSD support, so you're stuck with just 32 gigs of space, which really isn't much. I'll never understand why we are limited so much on space, and yet I can go out and for 60 dollars buy a 256 gig usb stick. The phone market frustrates me on account of this, and it's why I went with a cheaper phone, rather than a 900 dollar iphone or google pixel. I refuse to pay such high prices for such small storage, r"	0

" The LG Rebel 4 is a great starter phone for those who wish to transition from a flip phone to a smartphone. Very simple to set up, yet has a lot of features of the higher priced phones. It comes with ample talk, text, and data for those who are not power users. It has an easy to navigate menu system, with enough built in APPS to make it a very useful tool. The only draw back to this phone is the short battery life. Under normal use it needs to be recharged about every other day."	0

 this apple 6s is not user friendlt.  I have spent 50 hrs trying to get setup the way I need it.  To start with it does not have a back button.  If you fumblr fong3er something you have a hard  time correcting it.  when ever you need to go to many places you must enter name & pass word. the range of ringtone volume is too limited.  to many items do not defauilt to a normal setting and you have to find where you can change a setting to make it work. I have weather on my phone for 2 cities that I dont care about and cannot find how to delete them.I guess i'm stuck with this junk until comcast can figure how to make their system work with android phones	0
" This cell phone does not work, does not light, leave it connected to the charger a while and does nothing!"	0
 This is probably one of the best phones ever built.  Sadly Verizon does not support it on their network anymore so if you have one the best you can do is just recycle it. Which is sad because this is such a well-built well working cell phone	0
" This model has very few figures, I thought it had conference call figures among other, but it doesn't a little disappointed. Thank you."	0
 This phone is completely useless not only because you cant use it on T-Mobile and other networks like it says but its almost impossible to read the phone screen when in daylight. The fact of the matter is that he was not honest. I would NOT recommend this phone to anyone.	0
 Title says the device is unlocked but it is not. I took it to professionals and they said phone isnt unlocked and unable to switch. It is blocked. I will be sending back.	0
 UPDATE #1 I talked with Ectaco 2 more times. The first time I was told I Broke my phone and that I would have to send the phone to China to be fixed and I would have to pay for it and it would take 2 months !!! So I told the guy off and filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau and wrote the previous post and posted it on there distributors adds on the net. After a few weeks I called again and talked with teck support this time. He said they were willing to give me a NEW PHONE with the latest updates if I would remove my reviews on their distributors web adds. I said I would update my review. They said their distributors were pretty upset. How do they think I felt? It took almost a year of bitching and filing this review to get them to replace my phone. It is sad when companys make customers go to this extent to get customer service. They did send me a NEW PHONE and one of their teck guys even emailed me all my contacts. Thank you for finally getting this straightened out. I went to update the reviews on AMAZON and they were removed ???????      I would like to give my experience with Ectaco Inc. and the I travl 2 also look them up at the BBB and complaints on line. In Oct of 2015 I bought an I travl 2 that was suppose to have Spanish in it. I paid to have it delivered 	0

"&quot;With all the great features of this phone, I still can&apos;t believe what a great deal I got when I purchased it. I got a really, really great deal (too low too mention), but I would have paid more (shh...it&apos;s just between us), because I just fell in love with this phone as soon as I saw it! After doing a little research online, I found out that this phone had many more capabilities than just the ones T-Mobile had told me about in the store. From listening to my .Mp3 files with the built-in .Mp3 player, to using .3gp files as ring tones, to flipping the camera around to take perfect pictures, to the microSD slot...even taking calls on my Samsung WEP180 Bluetooth headset using the built-in Bluetooth feature, this phone had me whirring for a long time after buying it. I wish T-Mobile had left the A/V in/out feature on the phone when ordering, but then again, I might not have put down the phone to eat in that case! Even after 2 years of use, it still takes a licking and keeps on ticking. I just can&apos;t wait until I get my hands on one of the newer mobile phones, such as the Samsung Behold! I&apos;m sure I&apos;ll be mesmerized for another few years until Samsung comes out with something great again! Thanks Samsung!&quot;"	1
"&quot;you get what you pay for&quot;, that is NOT the case here, the unit works excellent, all features are running, camera quality(pictures,movies)work above expectation, I would easily price it over $100.00, price was a bargain.

"**WARNING**  **IMPORTANT**  ***NEVER GOT ITEM OR REFUND***  I emailed him after 31 days after the purchase date to give me a REFUND, and NEVER GOT ONE.  Not only did I not recieve the item, I never recieved a refund as well.  AVOID THIS SELLER AT ALL COST.    I ordered a product from this seller and after two weeks I emailed him just asking when the I could expect it.  It took 4 emails throughout the week and he said &quot;It&apos;s packed up and I&apos;m mailing it out now.&quot;  So after three weeks went by and no response from him I started to think something wasn&apos;t quite right with this transaction.  My payment went through the day after my purchase so it wasn&apos;t that.  It was only after I threatened him with a negative comment did he respond quickly with &quot;It&apos;s all packed up and I&apos;m mailing it out this afternoon.&quot;  So I gave him another week and didn&apos;t recieve it.  Keeping track of time, this is at the weekend of the third week, one day form the fourth.  So I waited and checked the tracking number for the 12th time (no exageration) since my purchase date and it said it was contacted and expecting shipment on August 6th and never recieved it.  It&apos;s the 25th.  I ordered something from Hong Kong and got it in two weeks.  It has been 31 days past the purchase date and I&apos;ve already filed a dispute and escalated it to a claim.

"*DO NOT FOR ANY REASON PURCHASE THIS PHONE* This is the worst and MOST deceptive product I have ever purchased. It is not recognized by any computer with dell&apos;s software to access and update it, therefore it can not be updated. Therefore it is ridden with errors just trying to do anything while accessing internet via wifi. I also luckily discovered (before entering any personal data in the phone) that the phone is compromised internally and daily it sends several SMS message to an unidentified phone number 1(847)770-3493. This number does not appear in the sent folder on the phone but appears in my account history activity. I noticed it because I have ATT GoPhone&apos;s $2.00 daily plan and noticed I was getting charged each day and was not using the phone at all. If you have this phone I would suggest getting rid of it because it is undoubtedly collecting some type of information and sending it to person(s) unknown. I can&apos;t in good conscience resell this phone nor can I allow someone else to use it unknowingly so I have no other choice but to discard both of the phones that I purchased. Both of the phones are internally compromised to send messages to the same phone number, 1(847)770-3493. *DO NOT FOR ANY REASON PURCHASE THIS PHONE*"	0
*WARNING*  Never sent me my money back after he recieved the itme do not do business with this seller 	0

", Phone/Tablet Is Barely ok, Even Good If You Dont Need The Phone Features Really. Although Their Are Several Tablets You Can Buy Cheaper Than This, They Dont Have Phone Capability, Which makes This One Unique!!! However The Speaker & Camera Are BAD Quality & Dont Work Properly. The Back Camera Is A 2 Mega Pixel Not 5 & Front Seems To Be Only .5 or 1 at best.  For Being A Phone Its Not Worth It, But As A Tablet Maybe, Although As I Said Earlier You Van Buy Many Tablets Cheaper Than This. Its Pretty, & A Great Size. But Not Worthy Of Phone Classification. Because Although The Signal Is Good, The Sound System Is VERRY GLITCHY.  I Personally Love The size, But Also Hate The Fact That You CanNOT Find A Protector That Fits It Perfectly Like You Can For So Many In case Of Dropping! So far I've tryed a 8.4 that does Not Fit. I will try 8inch Next &, tell you if it works. I'll add to my review as I know more & Find out More From This Phablet."	0

I will now preface this review by saying that I have used a flip phone up until this Xperia....yes, this is my first stupid smartphone and I will not ever get another one. My old GSM flip phone had better reception than this 'smart' phone on GSM...and no one should need all this crap that comes with smartphones...don't you people have computers at home? Why do you need one on your hip.  My flip phone was better. It made the call when I wanted it to and I didn't have to worry about all the crap Google bundles in its phones. I don't have the time nor the inclination to try and 'root' this stupid device and change 'bands' or uninstall the google programs....give me a break.......this is ridiculous.  I want my cell phone to simply have good reception in a major city and this piece of junk doesn't.   Beautiful phone though. yeah. Beautiful.  Ship it back to China? Right.

"...it's just that Motorola phones have finally completed the transition to complete Chinese (Lenovo) crap. I've had a string of five Motorola cell phones over the last 20years, initially because they were the last cell phone made in the USA...and after owning, I became a believer in the quality as well. My last Motorola was a product of the Google ownership period...made in China, but aside from a couple trim pieces falling off...I was okay with it. This Z2 is from the current Lenovo owned and Chinese built era...it is total crap. I've had it around six months...I don't expect it to last the year. My last Motorola...ever."	0
"...unfortunatley, I must've gotten hold of a lemon :( When I was able to activate, the phone wouldn't hold a signal (no bars), see photo attached. Contacted phone service provider who checked our signal...we're fine, but phone wasn't. Refreshed signal, restarted phone multiple times, nothing helped; tested inside and outside, as well as in town--no bars. Battery life wasn't so good after only checking emails, 1/4 to 1/3 used up. Cover and phone looked clean overall, but charge cover (little side plate) wouldn't shut tight, compromising water resistance feature. Finally, the GPS as advertised is NOT a navigational GPS feature...so forget MAPS app, or any app...can't download. That particular feature was really important for me. "	0

": Have a LOOK at this VIDEO first:   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFKYVE__Mug     Just take 2 minutes and read this. This is very EASY to do! It literally takes 10 minutes to setup. Simply follow the steps below. I promise you, this is 100% real. I would not jeopardize my eBay account status if this were a fraud. My feedback is real. Here is what you do. Click on the link below, register, pick an account type (referral is the easiest) and complete just 1 offer (Very important that you complete an offer otherwise your account will sit in limbo until you do). This is not like other sites where you need to complete one offer on 2 or 3 different pages. Many of these offers are FREE TRIALS with nothing else to buy with NO COMMITMENTS!     -Step 1: Click or Copy &amp; Paste this link to your address bar:   http://www.FlashiPods4free.com/index.php?ref=63681    -Step 2: Sign up and chose an account type (Referral is the easiest and best).     -Step 3: Complete just 1 offer (I recommend EyeMyCredit). If you dont cancel your membership within the 7-day trial period, you will be billed $12.95 for each month that you continue your membership. :-D Trust me choose this offer and check your credit report as well. Remember to cancel your membership within 7-day, if you don&apos;t want to get billed $12.95.     -Step 4: Then Refer 8 people to do the same as you did.   *** It is very important to do Step 3 first then refer 8 people to do the same (use eBay, MySpace, Face Book, blogs, friends, etc.! Do what I did; copy my ad). ***     -Step 5: Once everything is 100% complete just place your order. Then you will receive your 32 GB iPod Touch for FREE in several weeks (The SHIPPING is FREE!). Trust me it is worth it.     The reason these companies make money, is that most people do not bother getting all the referrals. All you have to do is post it on eBay or other website I mention before! They use us as advertisement by word of mouth, which saves those tons of money that goes toward yours and my gift. These are legit companies such as Blockbuster, Netflix, Game fly, etc... You can copy my listing if you want. You must use your own authentic link though. You will get your own personal link after you signed up and choose an account type.     I know this sounds ridiculous but it works! For proof that this is for real, click on the links below. This company is behind everything.     http://www.trainn.org/reviews.php   http://www.FlashiPods4free.com/index.php?ref=63681      Please take advantage of this offer!!!"	1

"1 for the wife and 1 for myself, great phones."	1
"1 thing that I hear very little about in regards to this phone is the Wi-Fi tethering.  Allow me to explain.......  I have the old Verizon unlimited data plan but I don't pay the extra they charged back then for the mobile hotspot (Wi-Fi tethering) option.  So to get around that, I would have to root my phone and manipulate the software to allow me to use the hot spot feature.  Then I bought this phone.  This phone doesn't verify my hot spot access with Verizon.  Let me say that again.......  This phone will grant mobile hot spot access whether you pay for it or not.  I'm tethering to my wife's tablet and smartphone right now as I write this and I DO NOT pay for that feature.  This phone checks almost every box I could ask for.  It runs stock Android, it has front facing stereo speakers, the camera is plenty good, the phone never slows down, the battery lasts me all day, and I have access to 320 GB of memory thanks to expandable storage.  The only thing I would change would be the size.  I prefer smaller phones.  If this thing was 5.0"" instead of 5.7"" it would be perfect in every category."	1
"1, first of all sellers indicate the new thing, is actually a refurbished machine.  2, many times to contact the seller, the seller didn&apos;t respond to a message.  3, wait for 20 days later, opened the case and Paypal investigation.  4, Paypal after intervention, the seller forced to apply for a replacement.  5, just like I encounter people, there is another.  Comprehensive evaluation: the seller irresponsible, not into the proper communication. But there is something wrong with the good faith.  Comprehensive evaluation is less than 90%, it is recommended that you carefully consider the sellers."	0

"1. Awesome signal coverage:  I have good signal when my wife and kids who are on the same network have little or none.     2.

"1. MAJOR ISSUE: The product came with defective ear-proximity and light sensors. The screen does not look original (it reflects light with a weird pattern) so maybe they have replaced the screen with a lower quality one which explains the malfunction of the sensors as well.  When your proximity sensor does not work it means that the screen will always be dark when you get a phone call, so you can't use your phone while on a call (e.g. to press a number on the keypad).  2. The charger that comes with the product does not work.  3. There are issues with the software on this phone too. It cannot get updated so I have this annoying constant notification about an update being required but it's impossible to install that update.   4. The phone did not recognize my US sim-card and I had to waste a lot of time in ATT store with no results, and take the phone to a repair shop where finally the correct settings for the US were discovered.

This phone came with someone else&apos;s Italian text messages in it.  The reason the     colors so &quot;RARE&quot; is because the manufacture nvr came out with the color! The USB cable didn&apos;t work, neither did the software disc. the battery was crap (only lasted a couple hours on a full change!) I&apos;ve had the phone for about a month and the colors all wore off! grrr. To top off the whole story, the lovely charger wont charge the phone any more!!!

"1st of all, this is not a smartphone. I have went through 3 of them &amp; AT&amp;T will not send me a different phone. This is the worst phone I have ever owned &amp; I have owned a lot of phones. Main problems are: The touchscreen is very slow &amp; very inaccurate, You have to pound on it to get it to work! The phone itself is very slow. It freezes up all the time &amp; the only way to fix it is to pop out the battery. Sometimes when I receive a text or a voicemail, the ringtone keeps on ringing even after I press view or call! If you receive a text, phone call or a voicemail &amp; the phone is locked than you can view everything on the phone bc it only stays locked if you go out of everything! (I hope that makes sense), the camera sucks as well! The phone is constantly dropping calls! It also has very bad reception &amp; you can barely hear the other person, sounds muffled! This phone is worthless which is why I upgraded my plan with a Samsung Infuse 4g! I advise everyone to stay away from this phone! It is not worth the time or the money!  PS: There are also bad reviews on this phone on other websites if you want to check."	0

"1st phone would not charge, 2nd the screen would not work. we have paid for shipping 3 times. Seller seems to have no concern about my problem. Does not want to help with shipping or seem to care if we ever get a phone that works. Very, Very, terrible service. Gave the seller ever chance to make this right. My son has went without a phone for all this time that the trips back and forth to UPS have taken place. Think about the service you will get before you buy from this yo-yo."	0
1st time ever using an IPhone but so far i love it. And it got here fast with details. Will recommend to friends 	1
1st time I bought they sent me the one only use for unpopular carrier. And the seller didn�t take it back. So if you use AT&T or T-MOBIL carrier don�t buy it from this seller. And E-bay can�t help you.	0

"5 star pocket Computer Tablet Smart Phone. I am never without it. I keep it in a shirt pocket at all times except when it is under my pillows.  I bought the international model a while ago and used it with my T-Mobile account ($30/mo. unlimited, Walmart) until one made to use with their network was released. This takes advantage of their 4G network and it&apos;s super fast.  The best gadget I own. Since getting the Galaxy Note I&apos;ve sold my iPhone, iPad and other tablets except the paper white Kindles and use this and my desktops exclusively.   It&apos;s quick, boots up fast and has a good size screen that is easy to read or watch.   I use it for editing documents, to read books, play my audio books, games and music. I watch TV and movies, take notes, written and audible also I check on Facebook and Twitter. I get the Drudge report and You Tube. I love using Dolphin Browser to surf the web you just talk to the search engine and bingo the page is loaded, I love it. And with messaging just touch the mic icon and it types everthing you say then touch send.  The cameras are fun and take great videos and snaps. You can use the front one for video massaging too.  The stylus or pen is a lot of fun and I have a couple of great sketching programs that really waste a lot of my time, but I love it. It will also typeset your handwritten notes and send them to email or a file.  You should save up and buy the Samsung Galaxy NOTE; the value is there, you won&apos;t regret it.   This is the best all round answer in the smart phone market right now....   Oh yeah, the battery is easily changeable and I have a spare charged up at all times even though I do get a full day out of it most of the time."	1

"A bit on the big side, but so far, it's rugged and simple. Does the minimal smartphone stuff I actually need like web browsing, and has older features I prefer, like a headphone port and a keypad. Also, no touchscreen, which is a major plus in my book.   I need and prefer a tough phone. I bought this to replace my old Samsung Rugby 4, which was worn out. So far, I'm very happy with it."	1

A buyer assumes a product is new if it is listed as such. What I received was a phone that looked like it was tumbled in a dryer. I have bought many items on eBay that were new as stated and never had a problem with them but once in a while you will get a piece of crap. It doesn't happen often but it does happen.	0
A CHEAP PHONE  Mine broke before it was even activated.  So that's what my opinion is.  Please feel free to send me a new Better phone if you really care.	0
a company that would answer calls and offer a repair location.	0
"A couple of days after receiving this phone, that paint began to chip off, leaving the phone unattractive and downright ugly.  Underneath the pain was the Cingular Logo.  Wow, didn&apos;t ever suspect that someone would paint a phone over like that.  I am sorry that we purchased this phone.  I paid 45.00 for this phone, probably worth about 5.00."	0
A couple of weeks ago my phone went out on me and stopped working. I was in desperate need of a replacement and saw them selling the exact same phone for a great price and couldnt believe it! it was listed as used so i expected a little ware.i had to try though needless to say some lucky bidding n a few days later i was surprised with a phone that looked new out of box deff. blown away and would do business again thank u so much!   Hope ur around for a long time	1
"A couple of years ago, I became a fan of Blackberry, began with models with a virtual keyboard. I never thought I&apos;d buy a Passport, considered him a great and comfortable physical keyboard. But after a week of use I think that is the best Passport Blackberry phone. Satisfied with the quality of communication, operating system reliability, battery capacity, and of course the best physical keyboard."	1

The phone worked for that what he needed it for, and he actually texted back then, but got verizon and left this phone. It was a good phone though    Pros:  Flashing ringtone lights  battery life  games    Cons:  basic"	1
A fantastic mobile with unique features truly limited edition now...  Thanks to G-D 	1
"A fantastic phone for less than 200$. It is the best  LG I have owned and honestly so much better than cheap Samsung's. The battery lasts fantastically e.g. 16 hours of heavy use with WiFi on and playing music over Bluetooth. (the GPS really uses alot of battery) If I don't use my phone to browse alot I can go 2-3 days without charging, it's pretty light on features, but the stylus is nice, though I don't use it much, the camera does not complete with a new iPhone, or the multi lenses of the V series from LG, but it takes very nice clean not pixelated photos The unlocked Cricket phone works perfectly with my T-Mobile, the only thing that doesn't work is the T-Mobile wifi calling which I never really use anyway. If you just want a nice phone with a good screen and don't need some crazy specifications this phone is definitely punching above it's price point by about 300$ Attached is a photo from the camera "	1
"A fantastic phone...especially for the money! 720p video, fast processor (can't recall which one at the moment) and of course every app known to man. Slim form factor and great battery life."	1

"a good basic phone. No camera or MP3 player, but is blue tooth compatible. If your looking for a no frills easily replaceable phone this is a good choice. The front display is also nice although its not color"	1
"A good basic serviceable no-frills phone. Mine was lost and I needed a quick replacement. No camera, awkward menus, difficult to text with."	0
A good buy to use while traveling outside the US. Just pick up a local sim card wherever you happen to be. Works like a charm.	1
"A good multiband all rounder, unlike the K610i where the keypad is far too small.  This phone can also be unlocked for use on all networks.     Used this model of phone before in Peru with no problems."	1

"A good phone, everything is as in the description. Delivery is fast. everything cool."	1
A good product very light in weight and functioning powerfully.	1
"A good reliable device that performs as it is supposed to.  A good phone with a fast processor. The phone has such a low friction surface, that dropping it is something to be wary of, but other than that, the phone is one of the best I've owned yet and I have had many phones."	1

A GREAT CATCH!!!!	1
"A GREAT item for the person who needs durability in an Android device. ONLY real downside is that it is ONLY a CDMA U.S. ONLY phone &amp; NO MATTER what anyone says, IT IS NOT GLOBAL!!!! It does require a Sprint SIM card (STUPID &amp; DUMB). This phone has NO capabilities to work on foreign GSM frequencies!!!!! The device itself IS an AWESOME design &amp; form-fit. Although it has WAY TOO MUCH Sprint Bloat-Ware &amp; NO Music player (You can get one from Google Play). The speed is FAST &amp; the IPS G2 screen is PERFECT."	1
"A great looking phone, in good working condition. The only thing about the phone, the back plate seems has if it has been painted black. There is a tiny spot of burgundy showing through, other then that love the phone and still will refer the seller to friends and family."	1
A great new album by TheChickenYard. Purchase you hardcopy CD here today!	1
A great phone had a very good price seller shipped the item quickly I would definitely buy from this seller again	1
"A great phone I feel this phone is worth every penny  And do you know why? Simple: the HTC One is one of the best-designed phones on the planet. Not content with inventing a new machining process to allow the body to be all aluminium, the Taiwanese firm has extended the screen to the edges of the chassis further than ever before, meaning you&apos;re getting a 4.7-inch Full HD display without the additional heft you&apos;d probably expect."	1
"A great phone with everything you will ever need. Yes it is a little bulky, but it&apos;s worth the hassle cause its an amazing phone. had it for the last few months, has never given me any problems. The mp3 player, wi-fi,2mp camera make it even more attractive. The touch screen is a nice addition too, though people may say the keypad is very tiny when flipped open. I used this as an mp3 player or as a internet device when i was bored. truly a great buy."	1
A great phone with extras and at a fantastic price recieved four days after ordering and arrived as described by the seller	1
"A great phone, I wrote a more detailed review but eBay didn't let me post it"	1
"A great phone, not only for the price (A quad-core smartphone for less than $150, simply unbelievable!) but also for all the features this phone has: the latest android version, good camera, a long life battery"	1
A great product for personal and potentially business use.  It is very easy to adapt go and allows you all the access ability of  a mini computer.  The screen has great visibility and clarity.	1
A great second device and perfect for emails! Plus its a pretty dam good backup phone.	1
"A great transaction, got here quicker than I thought it would!!!"	1
A great unit for a gift for a daughter. She demonstrated the functions of the unit which I found amazing.	1
A great used product shipped super fast! I&apos;m a happy customer who would shop with this seller again in the future. Product was well packaged and was just as described in the listing.	1
A great way to purchase a phone without signing a contract. Recommend everyone to purchase items from Ebay.	1
"A little background:    I have a highly technical and skilled background, comprised of over 20 years of computer/networking, electronic, mechanical and automotive engineering and repair. I work closely with computer programmers and software engineers.    The Nexus line of products has always attempted to represent what a phone/tablet SHOULD be. There have always been tradeoffs regarding quality (hardware fit, finish, feel and style), features (hardware features, not android features), and price. Sadly, Nexus devices, though always sporting the latest and greatest available iteration of Google&apos;s Android OS, have always seemed to lag behind the competition (if there were any) in terms of the overall quality, feel, ergonomics, and &quot;cool&quot; factor of their devices. It may be a negative, but look at their target demographic: developers, software engineers, and Android purists (those who dislike themed, modified, crippled or bloated versions of Android, which every big phone maker seems to include on their devices). They are NOT targeting High Schoolers, hipsters, trendy posers, or soccer moms.    That being said, there are many different features that some look for in a phone. Some people adamantly demand minimalism; old Nokias, Motorola flips, or phones that only display names and numbers. Some like a small, diminutive device, sporting as many features as possible (wearables). Others prefer to use something that is a mix of function and form, something that fits their hands, is easy to use, and stows easily in your pocket: These are your average smartphone users. Then there are those who desire something a little larger, just to make it so you can enjoy your high-resolution screen, and not fat-finger every other letter whilist texting. Something that has less of a tradeoff of function, and more of a compromise with its size. Enter the Phablet: A phone Tablet. Practical for a phone, albeit with a slight ergonomics penalty, but bristling with features, battery life, larger screens, and offering superior two-handed (or thumbed?) functionality.    The number one complaint is that the screen isn&apos;t as bright with as accurate color reproduction as it should have. The last time I made artwork in direct sunlight requiring all my colors to be Pantone certified, I admit, it may have been less than awe-inspiring, and the colors may have been a little more blue than is allowed. That was sarcasm. The reality is that this phone has a bright, beautiful and very nice OLED display. Yes, it is a last-generation panel. Think about it: Samsung basically owns the smartphone OLED market; If your flagship product(s) all use your latest technology, why would you sell that tech to your competitors, so they can better compete with you? Samsung though about this, and didn&apos;t let Motorola (the Nexus 6&apos;s developer) have it.    I love the minimalist, functional, full-featured, always latest-and-greatest, unlocked, no bloat, and no branding of the Nexus devices. No, you don&apos;t have to ask your carrier for permission to tether. No, you don&apos;t have to remove dozens of junk apps you never use. Yes, it&apos;s one of a small few phablets (it&apos;s either a Nexus 6, a Galaxy Note, or some unknown Chinese/Korean make) on the market.    My only complaint: It&apos;s overpriced. This is a $450 phone, not a $700 premium device. It&apos;d need to be made entirely from aluminum for it to command THAT price."	1
"A little nervous about buying over ebay, but product was of very good quality, no problem getting it hooked up.  My son (12 yrs old) loves it.  All is good."	1
A LITTLE SMALL FOR MY LIKING BUT CELL PHONE LOOKS NICE..ITS CUTE...FITS RIGHT IN YOUR POCKET.....GOOD FOR GIRLS OR TO TAKE TO SCHOOL OR FOR WORK...CAUSE ITS SMALL TO FIT ANYWHERE.	1

"A little trouble getting started, took it to Verizon, they informed me it Boost locked, checked around found that Sprint could activate it. Works fine. No contract, ok, but your phone is locked, so ""really"" no contract."	1

All in all, I would recommend buying from them in the future"	1
A lot of value for the money	1
"a lower part of the screen seems to be damaged, since there is bright spot about size of thumb nail that is visible when screen is light"	0
"A malfunctioning phone, not described as such by seller. After numerous attempts by Verizon&apos;s tech folks, was unable to make it connect to their service and put it into use. Verizon advised that the phone had some internal problems that probably wouldn&apos;t justify repair cost. Seller didn&apos;t answer emails, and purchase price wasn&apos;t large enough to justify a bare knuckles effort to resolve the problem, so I wrote it off as a bad deal."	0

"A month after I got the cellphone, the front screen is starting to come off, like the glue is not holding the glass. Was the phone refurbish, And it is being sell as new?"	0
"a new battery was installed and the phone powered on, but the battery drained to dead almost immediately. the battery was recharged, phone powered on again, and the same thing. paid $130 for a phone that does not work, and the case and screen have small defects so I wasn't able to sell it for parts."	0
"A nice looking phone that has the capability to do a wide range of stuff. A mid-range phone that has similar functions of a smart phone, but with a longer battery life."	1
a nice smart phone for the money.  able to turn off data and enable wifi to save money.  Battery lasts according to how many apps you have to have open.  I usually get 2 days before i have to recharge. At&amp;t network has been great although they do charge you for a data plan even if you don&apos;t use any.	1
"A nice solid phone. Unlike the LGK8 2017 this one has gyros so you can use apps like google sky, etc. Definitely good for the value. I don't know why anyone would want anything more than this one. "	0

Is ridiculous trying to have or make a sale out of something that has no value or worth nothing, put this in the garbage! Cant believe what people would do just to get money! This needs to change!"	0
"A phone itself looks o.k., but I cannot use it, since Sprint announced it &quot;lost or stolen&quot;. After hours spent on corresponding with the seller, and on the phone with Sprint, I gave up. Sprint had offered me a newer phone at no charge, though. I DO NOT reccommend buying used cell phones on ebay, unless all the serial numbers have been checked with the carrier."	0
"A phone not worth it:    CRASHED TONS WHENEVER EMAILS WOULD COME IN I WOULD HAVE TO SEND/RECEIVE, PUSH EMAIL STOPPED WORKING WITHIN THE YR I OWNED THIS PHONE. THE BATTERY WAS OK- NOT THE BEST- BUT WITH ANY SMARTPHONE BATTERY LIFE HAS BEEN CONSIDERED SOMETHING THAT STILL IS SLIM (MY IPHONE DRAINS TONS TOO) i would get it if you are already owning a smartphone that is a little bit more laggier then this."	0

"A rare example of smart phones with qwerty keyboard, and this is good. The old version of the android, but it is solved. Not such a great performance, but for surfing and communication lacking in abundance, you can run some games."	1
A really good phone	1
A really nice capable phone and a good value.  Latest OTG (on the go) in the USB/Power connector was essential for the Oximeter I wanted to use.  Has FM radio.  Other than being a little bigger than I wanted it is excellent!  Does everything I need and want.	1
"A replacement for my previous Nexus 5X which died. Can't beat these features at this price. Always up-to-date Android (Now 8.1), great camera, great screen, does all that I need. Only negative is that Nexus is hard-wired not to allow call recording, so none of the call recording APPS work. Not sure why they did that. Otherwise, no complaints.  Product delivered on time, in the box, new as stated. Thank you!"	1

a very good phone and I love the slide out keypad. It is chargeable and durable and works awesome. a must have phone for the person who texts a lot.	1
A very good phone for the price. In an excellent condition and works perfectly. The seller even included charger and an adapter. Thank you. Very pleased!	1
"A very good phone that combines everything I always like into one place: Blackberry high-end hardware, Blackberry security features, popular Android apps, unlocked (not tied up to any carrier), and specially at a very good Ebay price.  One minor con: because of the slide-out physical keyboard the phone is a little bit too thick than what it should be. But   it still feels very comfortable in holding in one hand, with its back made of some kind of special material that made the phone less slippery.  At $299 sale price on Ebay I think that the best phone I can get. And the service of the seller was also outstanding: the merchandise was delivered right on time and in top-shape. I would consider this seller's service again in the future. "	1
"A very good seller, it is worth recommending, look forward to the next cooperation!"	1
A very good team and at an affordable price  	1

"A very nice and excellent, it has plenty of features, and it does just about anything you want it to do. A great phone for a great price..."	1
A very nice color Apple did a good job in designing the very sexy & luxury Red color it suppose to add the ladies in cosmetic of her dress and jewelry. It is a hot product and very high demand. Just like the jet black at it first introduction.	1
A very nice phone and it was here in no time	1
"A very reliable salesman, the description the 100% truthful one of the article! Thanks, I hope to return to buy some of its articles!"	1
"A very smart phone for very smart people.  It is solid, it does absolutely everything I need a phone to do without all of the data plans and the hoopla extra packages.  I still use one to this day and I really don&apos;t see a phone that I want to pay for to replace all that it can do."	1
a waste of money	0
A week after I bought this it powered down and wouldn't power back up. Try the soft and hard reboot but got nothing. Paid to have a new battery installed and still broke. Not worth my time or effort to return.	0
A week after I finnaly recieved my phone and the 7 day return was up my phone stopped working properly. when I open the phone the screen will not turn on and I miss calls and texts as well.I WILL NEVER BUY ANYTHING ON EBAY AGAIN because of this I ended up having to buy another phone so I wasted my money on this product.	0
"A week after I received the phone, the screen started messing up, wouldn't register I was touching it, the camera opens whenever it feels like it. "	0
A well refurbished phone. Well satisfied with the product. A really good little phone which fits in the pocket easily. Just what I wanted. Unfortunately I misread the description (my fault) thinking that the phone would come unlocked. This error cost me another �20 getting it unlocked. Having said this I still give this seller a 5 star rating. I have already recommended this seller to friends and will continue to do so if they want a refurbished phone for a very reasonable price.	1
A worthy replacement for my 2- razr phones. The ease of the touch screen and full slide outkey board are a breeze to use. The battery life is wanting but that&apos;s what chargers are for.	1

"A) I bought for my kids  B) I do not like the product because I have not been here in my country enabled RD because they knew that when &quot;TracFone&quot; say they serve here. According explained to me on the telephone office that these phones work with an antenna of lowest frequency used in my nation.  C) There would buy this product again because it has to be a warning from the seller with such information to users of ebay so we can buy with greater confidence, because now I lost the cost of the 2 devices and what the shipping cost to the Dominican Republic, as a customer I am very dissatisfied, is money wasted."	0
"A.)  Battery life is horrible!  If on the phone too long: listening to music for example, it will heat up and kill the battery.   B.)  Wifi: Everyone around me is able to connect to the wifi, no problem.  C.)  Service:  I have experienced drop calls, and I have difficulty finding reception.  "	0

Abhorrent customer service and unbelievably slow shipping. Do not buy!	0
"About 1 year ago, US Cellular stopped supporting pre-paid US Cellular phones for customers who had contracts.  The phone I purchased was not a normal contract phone but a pre-paid phone that is useless.  It can not be connected to US Cellular network.  I believe that the seller should have known this.  Also, the charger that was included did not work.  I&apos;m out the $25.00 and have a dilemma - If I return the useless phone, how do I know that it won&apos;t get re-sold to another person allowing the scam to continue.  Maybe it was a mistake by the seller, but if it was he was selling more than one phone of this type and I am sure he must of heard from other buyers."	0
About one never work that I have my refund no	0
"About seller: Great service, fast shipping.  About the cellphone: Very nice, it has everything I need, web, google chat, email, youtube. It&amp;apos;s not as customizable as other smartphones but it gets the job done."	1
About this as a replacement phone and now I regret it the battery does not stay charged longer than 30 minutes to an hour at the most very frustrating	0
"About two weeks ago,  I sold a phone to a friend of mine, and it just so happened that i drop the phone by accident and it broke. i then decided to replace that phone for this one, at the time it look like a great offer, after reading the description twice, i decided to bid on it. i won the item.   It arrive very fast, that&apos;s good, but it was incomplete. The seller send the phone but misplaced the battery, and told me that the phone comes without a back cover. The charger is not for this LG phone, the one the seller send me is for a samsung phone, not LG.    I am not the king of person that likes to leave negative feedback at all, I rather communicate first and try to work things out, the last resort is a negative.    I requested the seller for a refund, but if I had the need to buy a phone on e bay again, it will not be from this seller, and I hope that anyone that reads this would think about it, before giving your money away.    this is why I never had a chance to use the phone."	0
"Above the expectation! Arrived a day earleir than expected.  In beyond perfect condition even though it was only listed as ""good"" it was like brand new! "	1
absolute garbage. The only worse phone made is a ZTE flip.	0
Absolutely amazing sale and transaction A+++	1
Absolutely fantastic the battery life is better than any other phone i have. My love of phones are Nokia i think they are the best and i have several as i am a bit of a collector of mobile phones	1
"Absolutely great seller. We had problem with handset and a replacement was promptly sent. Wow, before we know it, everything worked out great. I really thought I lost my money on this purchase but all ended well.    Thank you. Thank you. Thank you."	1
"Absolutely hate this phone! No memory, phone won&apos;t allow apps to be put on SD card. ATT unable to help.  Lost my ringers, it&apos;s difficult to use. I won&apos;t even give it to my kid.  Just bought an iPhone. Can&apos;t wait til it arrives.  Throwing my Samsung Doubletime in the trash!"	0
"ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. I PAID BY PAYPAL, BUT THE PRODUCT NEVER CAME, THE SELLER NEVER CLAIMED THE PAYMENT, SHIPPED THE PRODUCT OR REPLIED MY EMAIL WHICH WERE SENT MORE THAN THREE TIMES."	0
"absolutely hot wet garbage. have not been able to connect to Sprint network as advertised.  Whoever refurbished it did it no justice. It came with no battery, which I ended up buying and still I couldn't connect to Sprint with this Sprint-advertised phone...smh"	0
"Absolutely love it bought a Sim card for a dollar and used my existing remaining time for net 10 very easy I can play any high detailed Android game I've tried and I specifically tried the most detailed and they run just fine, and with spashtop I was even able to play a very graphically advanced pc game on my PC from a different city it worked but is impractical without a keyboard but was fun just to see it is capable"	1

"Absolutely love it, exactly what I wanted thank  you THANKS!"	1

Absolutely the best phone to update to that can still fit in a pocket!	1
ABSOLUTELY THE WORST STORE I HAVE EVER PURCHASED FROM! TWO AND THREE DAY SHIPPING IS A JOKE. CUSTOMER SERVICE IS RUDE AS EVER AND THEYRE JUST SELLING STUFF THEY ARE BUYING FROM AMAZON AND HAVING AMAZON SHIP TO YOU WHICH IS NOT ALLOWED ON EBAY! DEFINITELY GO SOMEWHERE ELSE TO PURCHASE!!	0
Absolutely wonderful.  The exact phone that others are paying 30% more for and shipped very quickly too!	1
Absolutely wonderful...... 	1
Absolutely worth every penny! Battery life on this phone is awesome!!! Waaaay better than my galaxy mega 6.3! 	1
absolutely would not buy from this seller again.  product was an imitation and it broke in few weeks.  garbage !	0
Absolutey perfect ebayer.  Couldn&apos;t be happier.  Everything was exactly as stated in the product description.  Received shipment extremely fast and was a great value for what it was listed for.  I would highly recommend to anyone and everyone.	1
"Absolutly love it, it has a great battery life, awesome response, and just get a couple of mods, wich are a goo complement to the phone."	1
"Accidentally dropped my old Nokia in the lake, so I bought this Kyocera Rally in order to keep my T-mobile pre-paid account. I took it to a T-mobile store, whereupon they put in a SIM and activated my existing account in the new phone. No charge for switching it.  It is so light I hardly notice it's in my pocket. Press and hold a bottom key to disable the keys so you don't accidentally make a call. Speakerphone is handy to take/make calls so you don't have to hold it. Very pleased with this phone."	1
According to Sprint this phone was not even worth the shipping and handling. But i can play the bubble game. Sprint could not get the phone up and running. I really wasted money having just being out of work and needing the phone for my new job.	0

Actually I have not had any problems other than having to change carriers since the phone I purchased was for cricket and it turned out to be for verizon when I received it.  Had to pay to have it flashed so it was not too good of an experience with this phone.  I believe that says it all.  No other problems since I flashed it to cricket.	1
"Actually i haven&apos;t got the item paypal stopped my transaction with my crdeitcard and deposit the money back  to my credit card why paypal stopped the transaction and cancelled the ordere,hate paypal, icant buy international products please do some thing about this issue or change to other bank like paisapay etc"	0

"actually the cell is used by my little brother but I think he is very satisfied with this phone, is a goood and cheap option."	1
Actually the seller has fooled me. He selled me a phone which does not match the product detils advertised for the product. I have paid for something wrongly advertised and i am loosing my money for nothing.	0
"Actually, I am waiting to here back from them because we need to return the phone. It doesn&apos;t receive reception anywhere and freezes up all the time. My daughter loves the way the phone looks but after getting it for christmas and trying to use it, it was a waste of money."	0

Acually it didn&apos;t work even though I wrote to the seller before I bought and asked if the mobile works in Malta (Europe). That means I bought it for nothing cause it is locked to Malta&quot;s network.	0
"Ad clearly indicated it was the USA model. However, I was sent the Chinese version that does not work in USA"	0

"Advertised > Verizon - Verizon tech, said that phone is not comparable with their system."	0
"Advertised as ""Very Good"" my opinion it is Fair to good. Was purchased for a Christmas gift. Cannot give as a gift for the following reasons. 1. Fair to good condition. 2. Many Knicks and dings on frame-hard to hold. 3. Missing AT&T logo on back. Maybe phone was modified or a ""knock off"". 4. Phone was locked into a ""You Mail"" account and I missed several voice mails. Had to spend time to deactivate You Mail account. 5. In speaker phone mode-microphone does not work. No one can hear me. LG confirmed it is a damaged main logic board. Total scam of my money and gift giving.  BUYERS BEWARE!!!!!!!  "	0
"Advertised as a 4g phone. It is a 3g phone. Tracfone in 4 months no longer services or supports this phone. When registering phone with tracfone. I was informed this phone is no longer supported by tracfone, and it can't be used for phone service. Offered to replace phone with one that is compatible, but no way of knowing what phone it is until it show up in the mail box. So needless to say. They are advertising these phones as 4g knowing full well they are 3g. And now the new phone they are sending me is not a triple minutes phone. I want my money back. "	0
"Advertised as new but back cover did not fit, battery was swollen and packaging was clearly opened. I had the same phone with other cell provider and loved it. Too bad this one was too old a model for many current apps per US Cellular."	0
"Advertised as new phone, but when i tried to activate it, Verizon couldn't because previous owner hadn't released unit. Absolutely useless. "	0
"Advertised as unlocked, I arrived in Australia to put in a sim card and have it say that it was not valid and that the phone was locked.  That was the first problem.  The second one is that the phone did not hold a charge.  In fact you could see the battery power draining visibly on the phone.  Just not a good deal.  I returned it for a refund."	0
"advertised as unlocked, was not, had to spend 40 USD extra to unlock. Once unlocked the phone keeps crashing, seller wants me to ship phone back before refunding..."	0

"After 1 week using the phone, the microphone is NOT WORKING!! REALLY FRUSTRATED with the purchase. "	0
after 11 days the item still has not delivered.   I sent a request for tracking information 4 days ago and there was no response.	0
"After 2 other attempts at trying to buy a s6 Edge for Verizon from other vendors, I finally came across these guys.  Third time was definitely a charm!!!  The phone came in just a few days, which is saying something since I live in the middle of no where Montana.  The phone itself was in immaculate condition for being used and considered ""very good""...this was like brand new.  I was amazed.  I have had absolutely no issues with this phone in the 3wks I've had it and it is more than I was hoping for.   I would definitely buy from these guys again.  I'm impressed!"	1

After 3 months screen just stopped working. At first the screen was blinking and after I restarted the phone screen was no longer working.  It was in protective case and screen protector right after receiving this phone as brand new(open case) 	0
After 41 days this phone stopped taking a charge. And because it goes over the 41 day ebay gaurantee they will not trade for another  phone. All the seller can say is try plugging it in a different way. We have been Samsung users for many many years and never had a phone just no longer charge after 41 days. It's obviously defective and the seller doesn't care. Just check other reviews...	0
"After 5 hours on the phone with T-mobile, it was determined that this phone is locked and can not be used. I tried 3 different brand new Sim cards all activated and working on different devices and none will work in this phone. There also seems to be a real issue with the reception on this phone. I won't buy another one of these. "	0
"After 6 months, this refurbished cellphone is still working.. and according to my brother it works good. It's fair enough"	1
After 7 days from date of Pay Pal payment I still do not have the phone.  The listing stated delivery 3-7 days.  Now it has changed to unknown???  Don&apos;t count on getting what you pay for with free shipping in a timely manner.  I would have bought a similar item and paid for shipping had I known I could not count on a delivery by the 7th day from payment.	0

"After a bad experience with another seller, I was hesitant to buy from E-bay again, but I wanted a phone and could only get it from E-bay sellers got screwed once buy DIFFERENT seller. Seller restore my faith on E-bay. As far as other seller still waiting on E-bay and PayPal to come thru."	1
After a few months of extensive use I found no cons only pros. Affordable and reliable. If you want a phone like the 1k phones move on. For the money this is a superb deal.	1
After a few weeks this began happening... See Pics... Bubble in center of screen would come and go and NO it's NOT the screen protector... LCD separation I can only assume... I would put it in my hoodie pouch pocket (no major heat-up) and apparently carrying your phone with you VOIDS warranty... <------SquareTrade .... So if you can afford it try getting a second hand Samsng before going this route.. Could be a good phone but if you don't stand by your product what good is it??? Bubble is now huge permanent and effecting touch sensitivity and location....	0
"after a month I was begged to wait 7-9 days so I did. no contact from the seller since that email or phone in my hands either after the wait, I emailed the seller back and no response. horrible, I've been without a phone this whole time and had to get another one."	0
"After a month of use, the phone died. Seller was to refund $50.00 towards the cost of a replacement battery. Two batteries and three months later I am still waiting. Junk."	0
After a month of using this phone and went back to my android. This phone was super slow and outdated. 	0
"After a month, the phone was no longer able to receive cell data. The data was turned on. Tried a second sim card but still problem. Seller refused to accept the return because it was more than 30 days. "	0
"After a week of waiting I emailed the seller asking about the phone. They responded quickly saying they would check. Somehow the phone couldn't be located so I was refunded my money. Disappointed, really wanted the phone especially since I ordered a case and screen protectors."	0
After a year in a half I had to change the battery. That is the only problem I have had with this phone. It is amazing I love LG phones very dependable the camera isn't that great buy who cares all in all a great phone. 	1

"After accepting my offer and payment was made unable to ship the phone as promised. I posted payment immediately, and contacted the seller to ship the phone. Seller stated that it has been already shipped but unable to provide tracking #. Seller changed mind and make it look like I requested to cancel the transaction. Not a trusted seller. "	0
After almost a month later I have finally returned the phone that was completely a waste of time due the fact is was already activated under someone else's account. And then they only REFUNDED HALF MY MONEY. 	0
"After attempting to use this phone for two days I finally gave up and purchased a new phone.  While the phone has a nice size and is relatively fast for an older phone, this was the most glitchy phone I have ever used.  The phone would turn off and back on again for no apparent reasons.  This was quite annoying in the middle of the night as it would happen many time while trying to sleep.  The phone would also lock up often and sometimes would just leave me with a blue screen.  All attempts at rebooting or turning the phone off failed and since the battery is not removable and the reset would not work I would have to wait for the battery to die before I could use it again.

"After being a diehard Android user and having owned nothing but Google Nexus products (Galaxy Nexus phone and Nexus 7 tablet) I switched to an iPhone primarily because I was tired of having two devices for music and phone. I thought I would give the iPhone a try. I am very impressed. iOS 7 is very fluid and smooth (much more so than Kit Kat 4.4). I can still sync my Google services such as contacts, calendar and mail with absolutely no problems. I feel like I have the best of both worlds. I am going to have a tough time going back to Android.I like the smaller phone as it easily fits and can be used by one hand.     I never thought I would like the iPhone but I am quickly becoming a dedicated convert. I may possibly convert to iPad in the future."	1
"After being so many years on iPhone, using this Samsung Galaxy S6 is such a bad experience. If the new iPhone was not so expensive I would throw this POS of Samsung in the recycling bin and go buy an iPhone right away."	0
"after buying the phone on June 22, 2012 it worked great until July 30, 2012. Then the SD card slot went bad &amp; it won&apos;t recognize any SD card. So basically I threw away $115 on a phone that can&apos;t be used to take ANY pictures!"	0
"After buying this lg440g, Tracfone said it wouldn&apos;t work in Montana, so they traded me for an inferior phone that didn&apos;t fold, but did have a keyboard that i didn&apos;t need so I bought a model that would work in MT., and still had a camera in it. Anyone interested in a fancy LG505C Tracfone that they won&apos;t take back, please contact me thru e-bay. $10.00 plus first class which should cost about $3.00."	0
"After charging, the item does,t come on.  I emailed the seller, but I have't gotten a reply"	0
After countless emails sent from my end I get a response offering exchange.  After confirming exchange nothing happens.  Do not deal with this seller.	0

"After experiencing the iphone and palm pre, it was very difficult getting around with BlackBerry 7130e.  Seemed outdated and frustrating.  I do not recommend this item."	0
After few hours it's dead.	0
"After first turn on to go through the settings, I realized that the battery was not fully charged. so I put the phone to charge, and next day when I try to resume the settings, the phone would not work. I put a return request immediately, the seller approved the return, and once the phone was delivered to the seller, the refund to my account was received shortly after. I was sorry the phone did not work, since it was a gift to my wife, but I was pleased with the prompt customer service."	0
"After getting phone to specialist it was determined the screen was not original but copy, therefore it easily broke up after easy falling and I needed to change it to original which cost half of the price of phone. "	0
After getting the phone I used it heavy for about a week before writing this so it would be a complete reflection of this transaction. The phone is exactly how the seller described. Can't beat the price and when I asked a few questions the seller was responsive. I bought from this seller because of the good reviews. I will echo the stellar track record this seller has. I am very happy and best of all Verizon isn't bending me over for it. Thank you!	1
"After getting through a few minor technical glitches, with the help of the seller, I'm in love with this phone.  I needed a smart phone but did not need the features of the larger, newer phones.  The size is perfectly compact.  It performs all the functions that I need with great ease and is a great little work horse!"	1
"After getting used to it I like this phone a lot. There are differences between the Wave and the Life it replaced one being the zoom function for the camera is operated by the volume button on the Wave, no big deal just some little differences like that to get used to. The Wave is a little bigger but still slides into the phone pocket of my jeans. Another plus is the water resistance. I will never own another phone that dies if you spill coffee on it or drop it in a puddle or fumble it into the bottom of the boat while fishing so if for no other reason this phone is a great value.

"After going to HTC sight an updating phone, works like charm, no problems, just have to watch what you have active like games an other little things that can drain battery , otherwise its cell phone, its works, hearing calls about average, but does what its suppose to do."	1

"After having this phone over the 14 day return period,it started running the battery down.I have another one of these phones that I have been using several years.It was new old stock when I bought it and after dropping it several times I broke the housing where the antenna goes.I took the battery out of this one and my new phone ran this battery down.The phone gets real hot when this occurs, like it is shorting out.My current purchase is a refurb.I won&apos;t be doing this again.  I went back to my old phone again.  These are excellent phones when purchased new."	0
"After having to buy two phones because the first was mailed to the wrong address and the sender refused the change of address, the phone is okay. Better than first turbo in speed but shatter proof screen is made of a soft material that scratches easily. Also the ""good"" condition mentioned. The phone had a good amount of dings and dents in it. So not exactly the easy nice refurbished phone they described."	0
After I bought and paid for the phone I was notified the sale had been canceled and I would not be receiving my new phone. I t was a very good price and I was very disappointed. Then after the sale was canceled it took almost two weeks to get my money back.	0
After I bought the phone he said he had a 7 day return policy and that he would work with me if it didn&apos;t work out. When I received the phone it wasn&apos;t what it was made out to be and he refused to take the phone back . THis is my last transaction with Ebay and I will never recommend them ever again. Sad to be lied to. Horrible experience and I am stuck with something I don&apos;t want and he wont take back	0

"After I received the phone I found out that it is not GPS compatible and therefore is not allowed to be used. US Cellular told me no one can use that phone, because all phones must be GPS compatible. the phone was very mush misrepresented. I returned it for a refund but have not heard anything from anybody. I suppose I can kiss that money good bye. Can you help ? ? ?"	0
"After I received the phone, I notice it would not charge with the adapter they sent. I try other chargers and nothing work.  The phone was only half charge.  I called vendor and told them about the problem, they told me that every phone is inspected before leaving the shop.  Well, they miss that one, so I return the phone and the sent me a replacement phone. The phone they sent didnt have a charger adapter at all.  I had to purchase a charger, after purchasing the charger I had it activated at a cricket store, and the store personnel informed me the phone had water damage, at this point I was fed up and didn&apos;t want to do anymore business with this vender."	0

"After I set everything up on this phone, all appeared to be ok, until.... I went to use the phone. What I had discovered the speaker and microphone will intermittently cut off. I can dial out and I can receive calls but cant hear or speak, and when speaker and mic go dead there is no Siri as well. I took phone to Apple to see if it was my setting up phone that caused the issue, and after a phone diagnostic was told that Apple could do nothing, that the phone was loaded with non Apple Parts.

"After initial problems of sellers lack of willingness to work with customers abroad (meaning not from his country), the phone listed above is not the one I got at all. After resolving the issue with seller and appointing the price accordingly, he took the liberty of increasing the price on his own (for shipping costs as it seems). On top of all, the device is pretty beaten up with cracks all over the battery cover and few noticeable scratches on the display, which was not mentioned in the description of the product. 2 stars only because of swift delivery and not recommending this seller at all.

"After looking at several Sony Ericsson models, I decided to get the C702 because of its attractive design and size (4.2&quot; x 1.9&quot; x 0.6&quot;).  I love everything about my C702:  the fact that I can use Google&apos;s exclusive location software, Google&apos;s Navigation software, text messages, any email server (e.g., Yahoo!, AOL, or ATT), record videos, take pictures with its 3.2 Cyber-Shot camera, save the pictures and the video on a micro card, update the software either from the phone itself or through my personal computer, make video calls to other cell phones featuring video calling capabilities, and many other awesome features.  You will not regret buying this cell phone!  Amazon has the U.S. version available on its Web site, but it&apos;s over $400.00!  So, you may want to stick with the European or Asian versions."	1
"After looking over many ""sellers"" and emailing questions to 3 different ones,..... we picked phonegorillas.   @#$%^&*()_+ great deal.  Holy #$%^&* when they said this phone was 9.5 and used the term near mint,.... they were not BSing.  I got this phone for my daughter and looked it over with an anal eye for detail.  I could not tell it from a new phone.  Works perfect for a 1/3 the cost or even better.   We will buy from these guys again, no doubt. RT"	1
"After losing my original L90, I bought the new model phone from T-Mobile.  The camera on the new phone does not take close-up photos well and this is a feature I need.  The L90 phone was only available from the internet, but it was in as-new condition and it has worked flawlessly for 3 months."	1
After multiple attempts to let the company make good of there word they did not. Received phone would not stay on... Returned... Received phone 2... Would not come on... Received new battery.... Phone came on ... Hardly any reception.... Had a service tech examine phone.... It had internal screws missing and front of phone had been replace before I received it .... The phone was described as new upon purchase. It is not new nor does it work . The service is so poor that I have to use my old phone. I am very disappointed in this company's ability to send out quality merchandise!!!!!!	0

"After one month of usage from the date of purchase, the phone started acting weird. The applications disappeared and i could not find them. After that,a few weeks later, the phone seemed to be starting to work again. But as soon as i download any apps, the phone fails to work. It seems like this phone only works when you make phone calls. And $120 that i spent on my phone, it is totally not worth it. When buying this phone, i planned on a a great messaging, gaming, and web browsing experience. But that didn&apos;t happen. This only leaves me with one question: was this phone tampered with or originally new before i bought it?"	0
"after one month of use i am very happy with the phone, i use it with TracFone and i love the cost with them. can't beat it. i don't use it a lot so tracfone was the way to go for me, cost is about $7.00 a month."	1
After one week I may say that this phone satisfy my wishes. The only thing that I don&apos;t like is a protector for USB cable. I can&apos;t open wide to plug the USB cable. I had difficulty in transferring my contacts but finaly I made it.	1
"After only a couple of weeks, the phone is next to useless.  An all-night battery charge lasts about 8 hours!  At 95% of the places I go, it says &quot;no signal&quot; and I can&apos;t have a conversation for longer than 60 seconds without getting disconnected.  Now, the battery keeps falling off!  I&apos;ll NEVER buy another phone on ebay!  Chris"	0
"After only two weeks of normal use of the phone I purchased from ExcelFone, the microphone stopped working. I have treated the device with utmost care since I received it as a Christmas present and have used it sparingly. It has never dropped or been damaged in any way. I have been severly inconvenienced by the fact that I no longer have a cell phone. I would like to fix this device or receive an exchange. I wrote the Seller three times at his/her Ebay Contact Seller option and he/she has not responded. I&apos;ve waited patiently for three days. Ignoring a customer is shameful. I am very dissatisfied and disappointed with the lack of customer service that I have experienced."	0
"After owning a couple touchscreen phones and dealing with the screens not responding or accidentally being activated, I wanted an easy to use smartphone with buttons. I did some research and found the blackberry pearl to fit my needs exactly: bar phone, buttons, smaller size, long battery life, and a current model. The phone I won was used, but in excellent condition. I have not had a single problem with the phone in the couple months I have owned it. It (knock on wood) has not frozen yet, it holds its charge for 3 days with a large amount of texting and emailing. When I talk on the phone for an extended period of time, the battery will usually last jut over 2 days. The suretype texting took some getting used to, but I can text faster than I could on the touchscreen phones I owned before. One of the few downsides would be the size of the screen. You have to zoom in a lot to view a webpage and you can only see a small window of the page at one time; however, that is to be expected with a small phone like this.   For a busy college student who treats her phone like an appendage, the pearl does what it needs to without going overboard. I don&apos;t need a million apps or the latest games, just the basic call/text features, email, wifi, and reliability."	1
"After owning the M8 model for a couple years, I expected a fast battery drain. What I didn't expect was the phone to drain to 80-85%, then drop to under 20%, then shut completely down. I don't mean restart shutdown, I mean android reinstalling itself six times in a five day period. The only way to avoid this was to leave it plugged in continuously. "	0

"After reading several reviews online, it appears this is the best phone for assurance wireless. So that&apos;s why I got it ...  The camera feature is decent. Easy to text. Battery life decent. Fairly tough exterior (i&apos;m a klutz and it&apos;s surviving me). Excellent screen lock feature. No pocket dialing.     True it&apos;s no iPhone or android, but seeing as neither of those is an option with assurance wireless it&apos;s the best you can get. And I like it. :)    Plus it&apos;s fairly easy to find screen guards and cases for this model. So that&apos;s a nice plus."	1

Don't know if it was necessary but I condition the battery by charging to 100% and discharging to 0% twice.  Followed up by factory reset then installing all Verizon updates.  Phone lasts two days on battery saver.  All apps work perfectly. Very happy for $180!"	1
After receiving the iphone I realized it did not work properly and had to take and spend more money to have the screen replaced!!!!

"After researching many Android phones, I stumbled upon the A9. I'm a musician and I was sick and tired of the scratchy, flat audio, that we were supposed to accept in almost every model from every manufacturer. Even the flagships had sub-par audio. The A9 is finally here to solve that problem. HTC has been trying to give us better audio since the M7. It had Beats as its extra dynamic sound source. It was definitely an improvement but not at all what I'm talking about with the A9. The A9 has a DAC built in. It's capable of 24 bit hi-res reproduction. It also has an amplifier to give us the volume we want. Coupled with reasonably high quality headphones, I'm using Sony MDR-V6's in my bedroom and Fiio EX1's when I'm out and about. For a mid-priced phone, I'm absolutely satisfied with the Audio. I can honestly say this phone delivers in every way possible. It's lightning fast, has a super vivid display, and it's slim and lightweight. I bought a used one in excellent condition for $205.00 and I highly recommend the htc One A9. Sincerely, Randall King."	1

"After suffering under the oppression of being a 3G owner for so long, I had an epiphany that I could get a not-too-expensive upgrade without having to renew my AT&amp;T contract at this critical time in Apple&apos;s product line development here on eBay.  However, I never suspected how much of an upgrade switching to the 3Gs would be.  It&apos;s infinitely faster than I&apos;d imagined--I still haven&apos;t quite gotten used to not having to wait.  I opted for a white, 32GB model, and even this has thrilled me beyond measure.  I love the stark white color because I never misplace my phone for very long anymore, and I love being able to load all of my (too many) apps onto this phone.  I mean I can&apos;t gush enough--it was everything I was missing in being an iPhone owner: better camera, video recording, compass w/ dynamic maps, printing abilities, airplay abilities, game center, background applications, wallpaper, screen orientation locking, notes accounts, accessibility options, longer battery life, faster syncing, typing, texting and browser experience (in general, no longer just sitting there for the phone to load an app or to actually type the letters I pressed minutes before only to realize I made a mistake or it autocorrected wrong), less application crashing and I&apos;m sure much, much more.  I&apos;ve only really started to realize how much different the 3Gs experience is than my 3G.  It&apos;s like being a new iPhone owner all over again.  I&apos;m excited to use my phone again, and I curse much less.  Needless to say, I&apos;m quite satisfied with the 3Gs and don&apos;t see upgrading to any newer model iPhone/iOS device prematurely.  If you are still a iPhone 3G owner, I can&apos;t express to you how much better your life will be on a 3Gs.  W00T!"	1
After the 16.99 that is charged for shipping the phone took almost 2 weeks to arrive and then when it did the phone was not programmed with Alltel it was still with Verizon.  The convenienced advertised by these sellers is not there and it almost too much of a hassle to deal with them.	0

"After Verizon told me I could not get this phone anymore and convinced me the touch was a GREAT phone for texting I bought it. Hated it, it is definitely not the phone you want if you text or if people text you a lot. I searched online, found Misty&apos;s and purchased this phone. Loved it, all went smoothly, arrived on time and I received plenty of follow up info from the seller that helped me out a great deal in telling me how to activate it and to avoid the pitfalls of Verizon. Great buy, great price, great service."	1

"After waiting for a really long time for the phone to be delivered, I received a phone that was used, not new. The seller wouldn't admit it st first, but then, after I contacted him many times, he agreed. While I was trying to return the item, the seller was rude to me and not willing to go with the refund. It took more than 1 month for the refund. Not worth it. "	0

"After working with cell phones for a while, i was usually a fan of &quot;phones&quot; not TOYS. A phone should be used for calls, what good is a cell phone if has &quot;bells and whistles&quot; but its reception is terrible, the battery dies right away? If you want a digital camera, buy one not a cell phone, if you want so many features, get a LAPTOP not a Blackberry, unless you are one of those few people who actually require one for business, where a laptop is too much. I actually fell for the T809&apos;s toyish features, but SAMSUNG is THE manufacturer of cell phones nowadays. Reception is great on their phones, battery life is at least above average, and they are user friendly in design. Knowing this myself i asked others who also worked in the cell phone industry and they all agreed that my new phone should be a Samsung. The T509 was also enticing because it was a candy bar style phone, which usually have much better reception to begin with as opposed to a flip phone, the &quot;sophomore&apos;s&quot; primary choice of cell phones. Those who KNOW and worked with cell phones tend to back away from flips ;)Well the T809 is a &quot;slider&quot; phone and helps maintain a small(er) size by sliding instead of flipping. The Phone is very light and quite thin considering it is two &quot;layers&quot;. Also factor in its HUGE plus, the Amazingly clear and large screen. Everyone who looks at my background picture is absolutely amazed by the picture quality. The 1.3 megapixel camera provides the sharp image. Overall, considering the phone is somewhat sensitive to movement (shaky hands / or the object being captured moves) and no flash and sometimes dark images, i am more than pleased with it. I think one if this phones greatest features is the fact that it can record videos of up to an hour. Couple this with the fact that you can put a SD Micro memory card inside, with with sizes of 1, 2 or even 3 Gigabytes, this phone can do alot of recording. I have taken entire 4th of July firework shows so i know that the phone can at least record for close to half an hour, as long as you keep all you data off the phone memory and put it to you memory card as soon as possible. The 80MB internal memory is more than enough for the average user. Multimedia nuts, like myself, NEED a memory card to store all the videos and pictures and MP3s. Another hint is that this phone &quot;allows&quot; the use of MP3s as ringtones. The secret is to copy the file you want to the MUSIC folder of your memory card, but RENAME the file extension from &quot;song&quot;.mp3 to &quot;song&quot;.3gp, unplug your data cable which came WITH the phone (Another BEAUTIFUL plus with this phone, and the fact that you can charge your phone from the USB connection!) and then find that .3gp file on the memory card and &quot;MOVE TO PHONE&quot;. find the file in MY MUSIC on the phone it is a usable ringtone, DRM has been defeated &gt;;) . Basically, i never liked &quot;fancy&quot; phones, but this phone actually performs as a PHONE, texting is easy with T9, and it remembers your custom entries. Nothing is really bad about the phone, just that it doesnt have a &quot;Memo&quot; or Notepad type deal that you can specifically keep notes in like a Nokia phone would. But it DOES have calendar with reminders, It features AUTO POWER ON for the 2 alarms AND the wake up call, which snoozes every five minutes up to five times. and you can wake up to your favorite MP3. Anything that this phone isnt 5 stars on, as far as missing or degraded features, the OVERALL phone makes up for it all and then some. 5/5 EXCELLENT!"	1

All GALAXY NOTE 9 SM-N960U made for US stocks are SINGLE SIM phones. You have a proof about this  on photo with barcodes on box - there is only ONE IMEI number/SIM serial barcode (in dual SIM version there should be TWO barcodes for IMEI number/SIM serial - every SIM card should have her own IMEI number/SIM serial and barcode).	0
All good according to a post...  	1
All goos as expected... thanks	1
All great except for battery life. The app Battery Life rates it poor.	1
All I can say about this phone is wonderful for the phone as shown in the listing brand new nothing wrong with the phone at all brand new good seller feedback even after I bought the phone good shipping this is the phone you want to have it does everything the reason I bought this phone instead of a normal boost phone cause let&apos;s face it boost phones do suck but there 50 a month plan price is very nice love my evo on boost network just awesome	1
"All I can say is that you should never buy it from ebay.   Buy it from genuine store you can trust. I screwed up twice with this product.   1st one, never reached to my hand, second one, I was sent by seller factory refurbished product. Chinese letter on it and It looks cheap."	0
"all i can say to you, this beats my android ....  "	1
all I received from soonersoft was an opened box with no phone inside. since I received an item (empty box) I was denied because I received something in the mail from soonersoft. so how can I give a review on an item I never received?	0
"All I saw about this phone was how great the screen is . How nice the camera is etc . Sadly this phone has connectivity issues that make it useless. I've missed more phone call , been unable to make or receive calls or I get  texts 2 days later . VERY DISAPPOINTED in this phone . And the only answer I get is that its hoped it is remedied with the next update ( whenever that might be ) . Avoid this phone . With so many other choices steer clear of this bomb"	0
"All I wanted was a new, basic cell phone.  This was the one I was looking for in stores for a few weeks, but couldn&apos;t.  The seller was very accurate in all the descriptions he gave of the phone.  I would buy from him again."	1
"All I wanted when I bought this phone was a phone.  My criteria was simple.  It needed good call quality, good reception, big buttons and a reasonable replacement cost.  I really don&apos;t care about smart phones, or gizmo&apos;s and gadgets.  The phone is sturdy, reliable and doesn&apos;t look too bad either.  I like the invisible display on the front.  For me simple is better."	1

All plastic and light weight not a phone to put in you back pocket while sitting down. I am on my 4th Idol 3. Do not put an empty sim tray adapter in the sim slot you will rip the guts out. Did that on 2 of them. Screen is bright and colorful. Sound is loud and clear forward facing. Battery is very good. Camera is functional. I love this phone and I have tried a half dozen others but always come back to this one. 	1
"all questions answered. smooth transaction, and fast shipping, plus great product! i didn&apos;t want the same phone all of my friends had and i stumbled upon the samsung memoir. from the first time i turned it on and transferred the sim card, i have had nothing but fun with this phone. the touch screen, especially during texting, is awesome. i had my reservations about using touch screens because i had tried my friends phone in the past and found that the sensitivity was not all that great, but on this phone, after calibration, i have a change of heart. the touch qwerty keyboard is easy to use and i have had no trouble adjusting from a phone keypad predictive text to a full keyboard. all in all, it takes a little time but not much to get use to it, but as you get to know the phone it&apos;s easy to personalize and use. I highly recommend this phone."	1

"All the pictures of this product were the ones of a S7 edge and what they were really selling was a regular one, and of course that's what I got. I feel cheated and I'll sell them both by myself but you can be sure I'll never buy anything else from you."	0
"All the right features for what I want and need to do BUT neither one worked, I ordered a second phone after the first did not work and the second phone did not work.  The seller was cooperative and I was pleased with their action.  I just wished the phone(s) worked."	0
"All the small bar phones I&apos;ve had recently have had signal problems.  Not this old tech Nokia; I get signal in areas where others don&apos;t. Small and mighty the 6010 gives all the basics and is very durable.  If you just want the basics, you&apos;ll enjoy thid model.  McDeco"	1
All these refurbished phones are straight up quirky they'll always have something wrong with them. This one doesn't have any microphone working. Plus it's slow compared to newer phones it's just outdated. Originally the specs shined and the phone was nice and Zippy but by today's processors this thing is hesitant.	0
"All these years I've heard about iPhones and how great they are, but never had one.  This one was tiny, no faster or more versatile than Androids I have owned.  Can't believe anyone paid over $500 for this when new.  What am I missing?  I paid $90 for this used one in beautiful condition and, after using it for an hour, when back to my LG G3.  The gullibility of the American consumer overwhelms me."	0
All they did was take my money never shipped out my item and I had to wait 2 weeks to get my money back it was a waste of time and had my money on hold for an item never sent never deal with this dealer at all youll just be waisting your time.	0
"All those reviews is fake, this guy is trying set up different ebay account and never take money by Paypal.all he did open the new ebay account and make you pay over another account than paypal, after you paid him, he shut down every account on ebay and another one so you cant contact him for for ship and delivery of your phone . Will wait forever that you have not get the phone but lost your money so dont play with him..this is scam.so be becarefull when you buy.  "	0
All though it came in a brand new box the battery seems to be defective and it doesn't charge the phone and gets extremely hot and that's the whole reason why I bought a new phone was because the other phone's battery was dying all the time so I basically just threw $80 out the window. So I'm not really happy but what ever I guess that's what you get for buying crap online.	0
"ALL YOU HAVE TO GO BY IS THE SELLERS WORD. THEY TAKE PICTURES OF A NEW PHONE THEN SEND YOU THE BIGGEST PIECE OF CRAP. THIS PHONE SOULD HAVE BEEN PUT IN THE GABARGE. I WOULD GUESS THAT 90% OF THE SELLERS ON E-BAY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE BUYERS. YOUR FEEDBACK SYSTEM DOES NOT WORK!! IF I WOULD LEAVE NEGATIVE FEEDBACK FOR THIS SELLER, HE IN TURN WOULD LEAVE NEGATIVE FEEDBACK ON ME WHEN I HAVE DONE NOTHING WRONG. SO YOU CAN&apos;T WARN OTHER BUYERS ABOUT A SELLER. YOU JUST HAVE TO ACCEPT THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE BEEN RIPED OFF, AND TRY NOT TO BUY ANYTHING ELSE ON AUCTION."	0

"Allow me to compare two very different order experiences for the same item, a New Samsung Galaxy NOTE 8 (SM-N950U1 Factory Unlocked CDMA+GSM). Order #1 was from a guy who claimed to be from somewhere in California but was actually from somewhere in China. Order #2 was placed with a guy from the USA. Order #1 advertised a cheaper price but was never delivered. After many emails back and forth guy #1 finally issued a complete refund. Moral of the story... be wary of eBay vendors... OK. 'Nuff said! Order #2 was delivered via FedEx not USPS. Ordered on 30 May, shipped on 30 May, delivered to front door on 03 June! Five (5) Stars for fast delivery. Item was advertised as ""Brand New"" and ""Factory Unlocked"". Visual inspection upon delivery supported that claim. Item arrived in genuine retail box. Phone is flawless, accessories are OEM and in OEM sealed plastic bags. Quick start manual did state that tweezers and extra S-Pen nibs were included, but vendor did not advertise those particular items as being included. So I give Five (5) Stars for truth in advertising. Verizon is and has been my service provider for many years. I took the new unit down to the local Verizon shop because my old phone uses a larger SIM card. The Verizon customer rep did a quick check to verify the phone and my i"	1
"Alltel has had so much trouble with this phone they have pulled it from their shelves. Mine lasted for 2 weeks before it died. The phone powered itself down, it would not charge it would not power up, it was just dead! Alltel would not give me another, and I was informed they would no longer offer the AX490 for sale. While it worked it was actually a pretty decent little phone. Average reception and the Tap keys were really cool."	0
"Almost have no internal memory, camera can't take decent pictures. I don't take this cellphone even for free. "	0
"almost perfect phone. One of the biggest problems that i face is overheating or high temps using it alone or internet, or outside with a hard sun it gets like 104, 106 f, right now i have not used it for about 20 30 minutes with a temp of like 75 and is at 98. IF i play for a while dead space with room temp of 70 or less it reaches the 115 and 120, at 120 it makes you stop what you are doing. I read about it and people say is the battery but i have not change it. I does last me a complete day normal use with some light gaming, at the end with 30% which last all night with no use. NOTE I shut down the 4G signal. Overall is a great phone except for the temp which can get ugly."	1
almost sucks uses language that makes no sense to me and it uses lots of apps --I HATE apps. imagine buying a new car and you open your truck and it has 200 lbs of steel waste soldered to the truck metal.	0
"Alot of sellers of cell phones on ebay, and alot with negative remarks. This one i bought from steevesj  is exactly as described with fast reply and shipping. I researched his sales and his high ebay score stood out among the others. He also replied immediately to my purchase and supplied me with all the info i would need to hook it up effortlessly. Thank you"	1
"Alpha entries on original and replacement don't work. Typca a name and you will not be able to do it. In stead of T, you will get TT or Twig. Same with all alpha entries."	0
already dropped it in the mud and it came out 100% ok.   Video files have to be formated to mpg4 to play. Solid phone very heavy duty. Ideal for clumsy people.	1
"Already had one, got the other for a friend who just loved it, I use straight talk for my service and this is a Verizon phone. Great processor speed , excellent camera and photo&apos;s , and I think the stick notes are great too. I even watch Netflix on the phone with no issues at all. I can&apos;t wait to move on up to the new Galaxy phones as the come along. Love eBay too , but almost all I need there."	1
Already liked this product very much.  This was a replacement for one I went swimming with.	1
Already notice the phone looks like it comes from China and is beaten up on sides and the button mismatch colors of side frame thanks a lot guys 	0
already owned one that got damaged. Needed a replacement. Since I already knew how it worked and liked it I wanted another just like it. The price was right for me.	1
Already returned phone.  I did not know that you had to use their service.  I thought you could just insert sim and use phone.  I cannot afford to pay up front deposit & pay to get out of present contract.   It's a shame because phone looked great with large numbers.	0
"Als erstes muss man sagen das Nokia 6230 war schon beim Erscheinen seiner Zeit weit vorraus. Es besticht mit seiner relativ kleinen Gr��e und seiner auf den ersten Blick nicht zu sehender Ausstattung. Dazu kommt noch die Robustheit und die Vielfalt an Zubeh�r,die es noch immer auch Jahre nach dem Erscheinen zu kaufen gibt.Die Akkulaufzeit ist sehr lang und auf der mitgelieferten Speicherkarte ist genug Platz. Ich merke es kaum wenn ich es zum Joggen mitnehme,und falls mir das Cover nicht gef�llt dann schaue ich bei ebay vorbei und bekomm f�r wenig Geld ein fast neu aussehendes Handy."	1

"Altho I did extensive research online, I was unaware that LG cellphones have problems with their touch screens.  This phone is a really cool phone and all that I wanted, but, the touch screen was HORRIBLE!!  After going online to research the touch screen problem, I found that this is a common accurance on this phone, as well as, other LG cellphones.  Very disappointed by that, as I am a big fan of LG products.  If you can get one with a good touch screen, it&apos;s a very cool phone, but, from what I experienced and what I read, getting a good one is rather difficult. :("	0
"Although I do believe this is a great phone, the one I received was defective. The screen went screwy 6 weeks after purchase. Somehow it fixed itself, then just a few months after that the battery went bad. A short time after that the screen stopped responding completely. The cost to repair is more than the cost of the phone. Now all that  being said I stand behind Samsung completely. My daughter also had the Galaxy S5 Active she has never had any trouble and she loved her phone. I am actually using her old S5 while I wait for my new Samsung Galaxy S8 to arrive."	1
Although I just got this phone but had a Huawei 7 . It seems like the look and feel are a tad bit better on the 8 over the 7 . Must say that the 7 still is a very nice phone and will be expecting the 8 to do just as good of an experience .	1
Although I thought the phone was also ok to use with T-Mobile the sim card does not work in it. Have not used this phone since purchase becouse of this problem.	0
although in the first delivery they sent the wrong model they went the extra step to help me get the right item i was looking for. would definitely buy from them again.	1

"Although its not dual core processor, it perform better and sometimes faster in compare with Motorola Atrix.  Perhaps it has less RAM distribution like Moto/Blur.    Screen is nothing but A1. Of course, its Super AMOLED plus. 4.5 screen is perfect to view in compare with iPhone.    Only minor issue is battery life. Once fire up the 4G for some heavy duty download or streaming, you better make sure that extra battery or similar device is next to you to charge it back up.    It is very light.  So light that I have to cover it with Ballistic HG cover for additional weight and protection.  some investment option for you to think about."	1
Although mine was used as a whole I love my iPhone 5s. My battery life is great I can go all day on one charge and I am always doing something on my phone. It's small which is great because I fits in my pocket with no problem but not too small to where I lose it. I love Apple devices to it was no problem syncing it to my lifestyle. 	1
"Although new, very outdated and not functional as it will not ring when a call comes in. Volumne is turned up as loud as it will go and the messages are left but no notification at all that a call is coming in.  Have trashed it and ordered a more modern, user friendly phone.  Not recommended."	0
"Although Nokia stilll makes and lists the 6010 on their nokiausa web site, Cingular has recently stopped selling the 6010 and has replaced it with the 6030. This is unfortunate because, while the 6010 is a well-made, easy-to-use, simple phone with good sound quality and volume, the 6030 is small, hard-to-use phone with highly directional (read poor) sound quality. The 6010 features and easy-to-replace outer case and a bright, clear color display. Especially important for my wife was the fact that the 6010 offered some of the same ring tone selections as her old Nokia 3595. The 6010 is nothing fancy but it is a solid, well-made phone that is not so small as to make it diffcult to use."	1
"Although not as powerful as newer models, the Galaxy S5 is still a great phone!  Personally, I like knowing should I ever need to change out my battery, it's a simple procedure, unlike the galaxy s6 or s7. The camera takes sharp clear pictures. And the average selling price on ebay makes this phone a great value."	1
"Although product was near &quot;mint condition&quot;, and shipped fast, something was CLEARLY wrong with the phone. Every time I make a phone call, it turns off! Even after a full battery charge. It always turns off when I attempt a phone call.     I would NOT recommend this seller on grounds that s/he sent me a product that was not working. The phone is a dud! It doesn&apos;t let me EVER complete a call b/c every time I call someone, 2 minutes into the call, the phone TURNS OFF!!! Waste of my money. HORRIBLE EBAYER."	0

This phone was sent to family member out-of-state, this unreliable phone has created a huge problem.

"Although the iPhone is all good in terms of looks and functions, the battery life is really really low. Tried to charge and it was still at 4% after 2 hours."	0
"Although the model has become outdated, it makes a good iTunes device. It does make a good phone but many of the apps I require for work do not work with the iPhone 3GS. It was kind of disappointing but I still use it to listen to music without draining the charge on my real phone."	1
"Although the new iPhone 5 is being launched today, I am still smitten with my iPhone 4S because the new iPhone doesn&apos;t look very promising(http://techattitude.com/gadgets/latest-leaked-images-of-the-iphone-5/)iPhone 5 leaked images). Trust me, iPhone 4S is among the best, at least for me."	1
"although the phone arrive a little beat late, but the phone  was exactly what it was describe on the ebay..."	1
Although the phone came quickly and was as described it did not accept my AT&amp;T sims card.  I have sent 3 emails the seller who advertises that there is a 30 day return postage paid but have not yet heard back as to how to return the phone.  Since he is so highly rated I am hoping that he is on vacation but if I don&apos;t hear from him by Tuesday I will give him a poor review and contact my credit card company about the problem.	0
"Although the phone turned out to be a disappointment, the service was ok. It&apos;s too bad they sold me a un-useable phone but they did send me an additional battery and charger to try to make amends. The &quot;new battery&quot; that was advertised with the phone didn&apos;t work with the phone. The replacement battery they sent me also didn&apos;t work with the phone and the cost of sending it back made it inefficeint to return. I just counted my losses and was done with it. Don&apos;t buy this phone."	0
"Although the product arrived in great condition, the microphone did not work.  Callers could not hear me, but I could hear them crystal clear.  Would I recommend?  No, for a good phone, but bite the bullet and get a newer one that works."	0

"Although the Xperia Z3 is a good looking phone, the lack of adequate speaker phone output kills it. I would have loved to have it as my daily driver, but the speaker phone volume is very lacking. "	0
"Although this could now be considered an ""older"" model smartphone, it's a very good phone.  We have used this phone for about 4 years.  I dropped mine in the ocean, so I bought another one on ebay to replace it because it's such a good phone.  It does everything.  There may be newer models that are better or faster at this point, but this was the best phone I have owned, so far.  It has good battery life, unless you leave various features turned on.  Then the battery life could be sucked down quickly.  But I have been able to use this phone all day without charging it, if I turn on ""battery saving mode.""  Very easy to use, a lot of storage, and an excellent camera.  "	1
"Although this one is small in comparison to the ""newer"" phones, it has all of the plusses that they have. Would highly recommend it to someone looking to purchase their first iphone."	1
"Although this phone is a USCellular phone, us cellular no longer accepts the G4. "	0
"Although this phone is advertised as a GSM, one has to be savvy as to what they say means--namely limited use in the US. Also, the directions came in Spanish only. I went to Best Buy and got the same phone, for the US this time, at a slightly cheaper cost!"	0
"Although this phone is amazing, please be aware that you CANNOT activate this phone with Verizon Wireless in the U.S. This phone takes a SIM card and can&apos;t be activated by Verizon Wireless in the states."	0
Although this phone is an excellent one this phone died just after one month of use.  I would recommend a new one to anyone wanting a phone like this but not to purchase a used one.  You do not know what you are getting.	0
"Although this phone looks new, it has some problems. Some keys on the keyboard don&apos;t work well. They have to be pushed several times before the character comes up. It is very difficult to hear the person you are talking to and I am not able to turn the volume up. Had I known these things before I bid on the phone, I would not have bought it."	0

"ALWAYS get the actual serial numbers to verify if the phone will work with YOUR local carrier.  This doofus sold me a phone which was still under contract under someone elses name!  I&apos;d guess he bought it from someone, couldn&apos;t use it and then re-sold it to me.  It took over 6 weeks for eBay to get my money back, but they eventually came through.  Yay!"	0
"Always had Samsung phones, the first they sent was not unlocked, so had to return. Got proper phone, worked for a few days then wouldn't charge, sent it back. They got it to work via their technicians so sent it back. Worked for 2 whole days. Wouldn't charge, couldn't switch it on, returned again. Got only partial refund as I had returned it twice before and according to them it worked NOT.  BEWARE!!"	0

"Am so impressed with this phone. Though the item was used, it is in very good working conditions. Its about a couple of months since the I got it and I don&apos;t have any problems. Only the battery is a bit of a let down but all in all its fantastic. Even though the review is about the phone I must also applaud the seller who shipped it very swiftly."	1

"Am upgrading from galaxy 6edge plus to this. The phone came new in the box and i even got free case and screen saver with it . Thank you guys.. It took me a week till i decided to buy this phone bcos of the price and am glad I did. My old phone couldn't place calls at some places and if it will, it's gonna take a while before it goes through and sometimes i will beside my friends and they will be calling my phone and it will go straight to voicemail especially at work thinking its was my carrier bcos I switched carriers a month ago which was not.. I got this phone some days ago and all I did was to put my sim in it and  am good to go.. I have Samsung account so I just transferred all my apps and contacts from my old phone in just a minute.... I will be going to Africa in two weeks and am so happy to use this phone with my MTN sim card."	1

Amazing phone ... by far the BEST I&apos;ve ever owned.  Speed ... power ... style.  Love it.    The only &apos;issue&apos; is that it loves batteries.  For that reason an extended battery is important.	1
"Amazing phone and exactly as described, fast delivery. I would buy off them again! Highly recommended."	1
"Amazing phone for the going price; this item has everything you may need in the working world. Includes a keyboard for convenience in addition to the touch screen options that other devices offer. My only complaint is the battery life; it is not the best out there, but this is only a minor setback for a smartphone this powerful."	1

"Amazon discontinued production of this item after I purchased and before I received.  I do not have a mobile phone; but, this one had all the features I dreamed of having, especially at the price I paid.   It isn't Android. Is has Amazon operating system and I heard there would be only one update. If you are fond of Amazons Prime product; this is a great little product. Very small screen for viewing unless you can get the prime account to display elsewhere (TV, Tablet, etc.).  Huge drawback: No future. Huge Pro: I read it can be modified to use Google Android (but lose Prime). High tech people could make good use of its many great hardware features ;)"	0
"AMOLED display one of the best ever  LTE speeds - 20Mbps down 7Mbps up  Distinct premium design  25GB cloud storage  Elegant &amp; speedy OS  Nokia Drive offline/online GPS nav  Voice search &amp; voice launch apps  Zune Pass/Xbox/MS Office  2-day battery life    Cons Power button placement  Can&apos;t change volume when screen is off  Only 85,000-100,000 apps at launch  Needs a notifications section  No expandable memory  Some older games lack fast resume    Summary You cannot find a better deal than the Nokia Lumia 900. I&apos;ve never owned a Nokia before but after getting my Lumia 900 I might be a customer for life. This phone is made of a material I have never seen or felt before. It feels very solid, smooth and high quality. The cyan color is absolutely beautiful and is definitely the color to get as it really stands out as a special phone. Everything else just looks plain and boring next to this phone.    The ClearBlack AMOLED display is absolutely gorgeous and blows away any washed out LCD like the iPhone&apos;s. Colors are much more vibrant and images appear to float on the top of the screen like an actual photograph. Blacks are so dark and inky that you can&apos;t even tell where the screen meets the bezel. There are videos online comparing the iPhone vs. Lumia 900 and there is no contest; Lumia&apos;s display is much better looking and much bigger.    The signal strength is amazing and calls sound much better than any phone I&apos;ve had. Visual voicemail is included with this phone for free and it works extremely well. 4G LTE speeds are blazing fast in NYC. You can get downloads in the range of 20Mbps on this phone. That is faster than most people&apos;s home broadband connection. Internet connection sharing with up to 5 other devices is available on some data plans as well. The external speaker on the phone has great volume and since it is on the bottom instead of the back it doesn&apos;t get muffled when you put the phone down on a surface or hold it in your hand. Outstanding design Nokia!    The camera is very good and can be brought up even when the phone is locked just by holding down the dedicated camera button. You can snap photos in widescreen or fullscreen mode and upload directly to Facebook Twitter or Skydrive without having to open another app. Worth mentioning you also get 25GB of free cloud storage with SkyDrive. Very nice!    So far battery life has been incredible by smartphone standards. After using my phone all day yesterday to look at apps, browse the web, take photos, listen to music, etc. I had almost 50% battery left by the end of the day. This phone can last you a day and a half easily on a single charge.    AT&amp;T includes some nice apps like U-verse video streaming and MyWireless to check your data usage change your plan or pay your bills. You also get a ton of exclusive apps like Nokia&apos;s turn by turn navigation and public transit apps. Nokia owns Navteq the mapping company which provides map data for tons of companies like Garmin so this is a major addition to the value of the phone. There are also exclusive CNN, ESPN, Univision, and college sports applications on Nokia&apos;s Lumia phones. These apps are excellent and all have 4 or 5 star ratings from users. There are also a few dozen exclusive apps coming from Electronic Arts for the Lumia phones. I love earning Xbox Live achievements on the go. You can even see your friends avatars and edit your Xbox Live avatar on this phone!    There are a ton of great apps on Windows Phone so I&apos;ll just highlight a few of my favorites: YouTube"	1

"An all round winner when it comes to a phone tablet, this is my second n900, i had bought one but my friend in ireland loved it so much that he gave me 500 euros for it so i came stright on here to buy another, with the phone being on a open source platform it makes it the most hackable phone on the marker so the app potential is unlimited, to mame but a few fun apps are qik which is a live video broadcast where ever you are in the world, with this phone it great video stream unlike other phones that struggle with this app, with the world cup coming up it has also got a great screen for watching the games live from any live streaming site while on the move, i used it on the train the other day to watch the england game, full flash web browsing lets you enjoy the web as you see it in a pc. multi tasking lets you have a number of apps open at any time, up to 48 gb of storage with 1 gb of flash memory so it is not a slow phone either! all in all i have had nothing but good experience with the 2 phones..battery life is about a day full use ie.. 9/10 hours browsing the internet and multi tasking, i have bought another back up battery however for mine for when i&apos;m traveling! you can also look up &apos;nokia n900 accessories&apos; to get a all in one pack of extras for around �10....oh and check out the fm transmitter :@)"	1
"An AMAZING PHONE!!! I bought this product after owning the Omnia7 and I must say what a fantastic upgrade. First, the OS is beautiful and after two years of the windows phone OS I still smile with excitement while looking at the start screen, its an amazing notification tool. The OS itself is buttery smooth, no hiccups or freezing with my experience from the three devices that Ive owned (HD7, Omnia 7, and the Focus S). As for the hardware, I was afraid I got ripped off when I received my package but upon opening it I was stunned at how light the phone is, when I let people hold it they are just as stunned. The screen is beautiful with deep inky blacks to die for, however it only has 480x800 resolution like the Galaxy S II but its not bad at all. The battery life is decent, I squeeze about 24hrs out of it with heavy use and with battery saver on without charging overnight I can get about 2 days and 3hrs from it. In order to get the bright whites I had to go to the extra settings and turn auto display intensity off, a fact that concerned me when first playing with it in store. I could compare it to the iPhone but its not an iPhone, I think its best competitor is the Nokia Lumia 900, however the plastic makes the Focus S light and less likely to shatter the display glass. The sound quality is amazing with my Klipsch S4i but I seem to lack bass but does offer a clear even sound all around. The camera is very nice and 720p Video is amazing when shot in direct sunlight. Whats great to have is the 4G, while its not LTE I do get about 3-6mbps here in Chicago.  Im currently running it on Straight Talk using their AT&amp;T compatible sim which gives me unlimited talk, text, and, apparently data as well for only $45 a month. With Straight Talk it took a bit of poking around to get Bing service and my Zune pass working but now that I got it I always stream over 4G with no interruptions. The app selection is decent but I suggest you use AppFlow to discover the best apps, its an amazing why to get the best out of the marketplace. Dont hesitate if you spot a deal on this it is an AMAZING PHONE!!!!"	1
An amazing phone. Convenient menu and beautiful design. I would advise others to buy who do not like Windows and Android application	1
An amazing phone. High quality in all of its features. So many parts to it. Still figuring it out so I can use it to its best!	1
"AN AMAZING VERIZON MESSAGING PHONE!    I had, owned the LG VX5400 prior to owning this wonderful phone. I purchased it because I was in the market for a new device, and my contract was up. I have used many smartphones and QWERTY keyboarded phones, so I decided on another one (even though my last was not a qwerty).     As soon as I got this phone I really thought of the ENV9900. This was my last eNV phone that I had owned, and because of me washing it was left with the 5400. I immediately fell in love with the keyboard, and the amount of messages this can hold is simply amazing as well.     The camera is the best of any 3.2 MP camera I have seen. Because I have had cell phones, my digital camera was only a 3.2 MP (old camera) and I thought it had good shots. I actually resorted to putting it in a drawer and using this for full time imaging and pictures if that tells you something. No issues here. Recommended 100%"	1

"An excellent phone - nice and simple! I don&apos;t need a camera, internet browser, radio, music player, voice recorder, etc. I already have all those things, thank you very much, so why would I want inferior versions of them which simply guzzle away the battery? I don&apos;t even need a colour screen. All I want is a basic phone that makes calls and sends text messages, and this one fits the bill perfectly. The battery life is amazing, because it doesn&apos;t have a colour screen or any of the aforementioned power-hungry features! Only two things let it down: 1) the ringtones are pretty ugly, and the lowest volume (Level 1) isn&apos;t very quiet at all! It also doesn&apos;t have a basic &apos;ring-ring&apos; tone (the closest thing it has to a traditional ring sound is the tone named &apos;Spiral&apos;). And 2) the keypad is quite stiff and difficult to press (especially the &apos;Select&apos; button in the middle of the phone), which makes texting rather uncomfortable. But at least it&apos;s completely dustproof and easy to clean if it gets sticky or dirty.    Because of those two faults I give this phone eight marks out of ten, rather than ten out of ten. It&apos;s a great phone overall. Who needs so-called &apos;smart&apos; phones? I&apos;ll stick to &apos;dumb&apos; phones like this! :-)"	1
"An excellent phone, I got this phone in July of 2010, and the first phone failed on me. It shut off tons, well I ordered a replacement, and it really has changed all I like on this phone, I LOVE IT, has a nice keypad, and runs really good. Here is my initial review from phonescoop.    efinitely a phone you should choose.    My father purchased this phone RIGHT after we saw it launch from Verizon. It had just been released to the website. So we went to the store that has the phones where we usually see them or get accessories, and they informed us it was online only and was out of stock. So then it was in the stores and online and then it was out of stock again. Definitely a hot seller.    Well we got one and after 1 almost 2 days of experimenting the phone isn&amp;apos;t that bad of a phone. It&amp;apos;s got a big screen and compared to my Motorola Rival (Previously I owned the Voyager) i gotta say both phones are pretty good.    Pros:  Big screen  good keypad  all the features  social app  cons:  the scroll was hard to get used to"	1
"An executive was interviewing a young woman for a position in his company. He wanted to learn something about her personality, so he asked, &quot;if you could have a conversation with anyone, living or dead, who would it be?&quot;    She quickly responded, &quot;The living one.&quot;"	0
An extremely powerful business phone with superb call quality and messaging capabilities. Well worth investing a bit of time to understand it and overcome it's limitations (mainly app related). The most secure operating system ever made - remember the Sony hack! Highly recommended.	1
An honest seller is all i can say. Respect to you. Stay an honest seller. Item #:152766424552 	1
An improvement on my old phone. Much more capability and versatility. I like the camera zoom and also the ablity to add storage so now I can play my music and watch movies when I travel and not take a separate camera and mp3 player. Cool	1
"an is extremely great design .. many applications. not much different than the blackberry 7290 but ... only a CDMA frequency should was missed the point.  in short, can not be used because today&apos;s CDMA technology is outdated and is no longer used anywhere.  I only bought it about order to ART DECOR."	0
"An old Blackberry yes!! the 9860 comes like new, i'm a bit tire of android and want to go back to this oldies phone not very exciting now but very capable at calling and texting, in social not much to do but i forget from the constantly updates google perform almost every two weeks and the phone no matter how much memory you have, you end up without memory."	1
An old school delight!!!	1
An old school phone with great easy to use features. Truly a nextel classic. Very durable and long lasting. Had this phone a few years back for personal use but need it a nextel now for my job. I will never switch back to a Motorola from my blackberry but if u have to use nextel/boost... this is a great choice    PEOPLE THIS IS FOR THE REVIEW OF THE PRODUCT NOT YOUR SELLER!!! STOP POSTING FEEDBACK IN THE REVIEWS SECTIONS... MORONS...	1
"An outstanding balance of performance and value that Motorola can be proud of. The phone does everything you need it to, and does it well. It's overall design and solid construction gives the impression of competence and quality. All in all, it's my favorite Motorola since my Razr."	1
An unreliable phone overall. Dropped calls and whatnot. You&apos;re better paying more for a better phone if you expect it to last. This was for my mom who just wanted a simple and basic but reliable phone and she says she hates it.	0
"and just for emergencies or a teen starting with a phone   I would say this phone would be a teen/kid just starting with a phone. The t229 was a good phone, but the friends that had it experienced it shutting down and it had glitches where the front paint would chip and it wasn&apos;t even dropped, seriously one still had his in a case, took it off and it had marks, idk why, or if it was because of the hard case or what.    But this phone is tons better. It reduced all of the glitches of the previous model that i and my friends had. It&apos;s a much better purchase. You wont be disappointed at all in this phone."	1

"Androids are the worst phones ever made when it comes to phones. Worst ever. I have had this phone for a couple of weeks now and I hate it. It's junk compared to apple. The only reason I got this was because it's big. Come to find out, it's junk. Once I pay off my iPhone bill, I'm switching back to an iPhone. iPhones are way better quality compared to androids. Everything is better on it compared to androids. You want a good quality phone that will last you long? GET AN IPHONE!!!!"	0

"	0
"Apparently this LG is a really old type. I knew it came without a SIM card, but I had one in my old phone. The SIM card for this particular phone is obsolete and fortunately Verizon was stiill able to get one to me. This phone has very limited battery life, a full charge didn't last long enough for the alarm to go off in the morning. (7hours). 5 hours under regular use is about it.  It doesn't have enough brain power to use Firefox as a browser, it locks up everytime, and the only way to get it back into action is to remove the battery and start over. All in all I hate this phone and advise that nobody will buy this model. It should be known that this phone is technologically retarded and inept."	0
"Apparently, luckycell thinks it's ok to try and sell parts they do not have. Purchased a camera from them for a rush order for a customer. Paid for expedited shipping to get the part quickly. Later that day, luckycell comes back stating they don't have that part and they would get more in at a later date. Frustrated.. I went back to find the part from another vendor, and luckycell still had the listing for the cameras as active and up. "	0
"Apparently, this phone was previously only used for 1 and 1/2 years under a monthly pay per use plan. I bought it on a tight budget on ebay 3 weeks ago thinking that the value was there and now it won&apos;t stay on...it keeps turning itself off even though the battery is charged. It was only used for phone calls and NOTHING else.  Very disappointed in the Nokia product."	0
Appears to be ok so far. A few small concerns. Working them out	1
Apple has great customer service I was able to send them a phone that was not recognizing my thumbprint and within three days they received it and set me back a new one. Compared to HP were I have been waiting for three weeks to receive back my broken laptop I would consider Apple in the future for other products.	1
"Apple insists on making decisions that I believe should be made by Consumers (i.e.: Big Brother/Sister Apple), and which I refuse to permit Apple to make for me.  Regretfully, one only learns the extent of Apple's demands/requirements with respect to decision making when one gets an iPhone in one's hands for the first time. In addition, the iPhone came with no owner's manual, and I could not locate one on Apple's web site. The Vendor's support was limited to a telephone number, which makes little sense when one is trying to get a mobile phone to operate. Zero documentation otherwise included. Also, while sold as being tied to a particular carrier, no SIM Card was included, and when the iPhone was powered up, there was no indication on-screen among the very few working icons that it was associated with any carrier, or even permit one to contact that carrier using the iPhone as delivered.  It was a very expensive do-nothing paper weight which I promptly shipped back to the Vendor."	0
"Apple iPhone 3gs 16gb-this is a super phone! he is the best! I&apos;m very pleased. Buy it! Comfortable, stable and fast. All it says is working exactly as it should. And that has not been reported solved by installation of applications that will make a few thousand. And all of them as comfortable and stable, because going through the approval of Apple."	1

"Apps don't run as good, they close all the time, I have tried everything to fix it. WhatsApp does not even finish configuring and instagram closes every few seconds. Would really not recommend, If I had read it said windows I would have never bought but the fault is on my for not realizing that windows had phones now. "	0
"Are refurbish NOT NEW phones!!! not work, bad phones!!! i boug 8 and the 8 not work!!!"	0
"Are you going to put your life possibly your children's and spouses life in danger when your house goes up in flames. Is the seller going to compensate you for damages to whatever it may damage, property or person, I don't think so. Unless your going to buy this paper weight to power it down and hang it on the wall because you are an apple fan boy and have the money sure do it. Yes out of the whatever percentage of Note 7 have been defective so far how does this seller know this isn't one of them. It has happened to mostly phones that have had heavy use so if Samsung  didn't issue the recall over time they all probably would of went up in smoke due to the batteries wearing down even more. I had a note 7 and even though the experience size and design where top notch I was forced to switch to a another Samsung or get a full refund. After being an Android guy for well since they the original galaxy or maybe before decided to give the iPhone 7 a shot since AT&T had a few they just got a shipment of. I have to say all the Android fan boys out there you need to use iOS for a while because I am amazed at how much easier and how less little steps I have to take to get where I want to go.  But when thinking of buying a phone Samsung recalled twice and banned all sales you may want to thin"	0
Are you kidding and IPhone for what I paid $298.00 un heard of. Phone is in great shape works as promise etc. Even with getting my own SIM card was a great deal.	1
ARE YOU SERIOULY STUPID? YOU KNOW SOME LITTLE TEENAGER IS GOING TO BUY THE DEMO PHONES AND THEN THEY AREA GOING TO BE SO UPSET THAT YOU SOLD THEM A PHONE THAT DOESNT WORK. I DONT THINK WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO DO IS FAIR. I KNOW YOU PUT DEMO PHONE ON THE ADD BUT I KNOW THERE IS SOME LITTLE GIRL OR BOY THAT IS GOING TO BE SO HAPPY TO GET THE COOLEST NEW PHONE AND THEY WILL BUT IT. I JUST DONT THINK ITS ETHICAL FOR IT TO BE PUT IN THE SAME CATAGORIE AS WORKING CELL PHONES ON EBAY.  OH YEAH AND I AM NOT TRYING TO BE MEAN ABOUT ANY OF THIS I AM JUST LOOKING OUT FOR OTHERS   me	0

"Arrived 4 days before schedule, in amazing condition (listed as fair), but only one blemish on entire phone. Added to network without any issues. Great seller. Fast response time on communication as well "	1

"Arrived early, new in box. My son was thrilled!"	1
"Arrived fast, minor issue trying to activate it but this was quickly resolved by the seller when I messaged them. I would definitely purchase from them again. All around awesome deal."	1
"Arrived fine, seller delivered well. No issues there. But the product itself is awful, poorly made, obviously fake and I'm worried about charging it and fire risks and all that. Does say ""Original Nokia"" in the advert description  and is definitely not. Took the battery out and is all fake, sim cover unit is cheap plastic, Nokia sticker is obviously printed and missing logo and correct keypad. For 25 bucks, fine, a but of fun, but it, to my eyes, is sold as an original product and it just isn't.  Front cover fell off when I opened the battery case, has the Nokia operating graphics and screen looks the same but cheap, flimsy plastic. Beware, for 25 bucks, not too fussed but this isn't a real nokia."	0

As a customer I purchased the wrong carrier by accident and this seller does not care. He will just take your money and will not care for his customers. *****DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER****	0
"As a new comer to apple I can honestly say I am sorry I waited so long and glad I stared with the SE. It is perfect for what I need.  I have no way of telling you anything other than iSE is a sturdy device with great features and a nice long battery life.  Many say it is too small, but coming from a palm pro and Nokia E71x user, this screen is more than double so I see it as big. My only complaint with apple is, unlike every cell phone I have usedzg where pretty much any sounds could be saved to ringtones, apple is proprietary and disagreeable. I find that unsatisfactory. People should be able to save wav files as ringtones without having to use itunes or buy them in app the forum. "	1
"As a newbie to the Note, all I can say is wow. It&apos;s features  are great. If you like pictures, they are professional quality. If you like apps, the Android market has so many freebies. If you want to use the internet, it&apos;s like a mini computer. I can just go on my phone without needing a laptop. The only issue is the size. I knew it was big but I had no clue. Watching videos is a breeze. I would suggest that you get accessories for this phone. The back is flimsy and a bluetooth is needed. There is no way I can hold it in one hand and talk on it for hours."	1
"As a nurse I got this phone and immediately after charging realized it charged only a few hours at a time and you had to jiggle charging poet, took to  who confirmed port had, fixable for $150, opened a return, waited 2 days, layer return accepted & I was to return phone at my time & expense.  Took phone to   to wipe clean and they stated the PHI/HIPAA info on my patience does not ever completely go away & can be retrieved.  So to protect my patients, I paid to have port fixed!  Praying phone is truly now mine, as it was also assigned to another iTunes account.  BEWARE! "	0
"As a telecommunications engineer, I wanted my aging Father to have a Cellular phone that had large buttons so he would be able to dial for personal calls, but more importantly for emergencies.  The phone looked fantastic and perfect for a senior.  It arrived and is very cheaply made, It claims it was 'unlocked' to all carriers and when I placed the AT&T SIM in  the phone it would not accept it and would only stay in ""Emergency Mode"".  Very disappointed --  Take this advice from a telecommunication expert with 27 years experience -- DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!!!"	0

"As all devices or almost all of them, the galaxy note legacy is still the best (in its type with electronic pencil and other features) smart phone in the market (for me). No complain and not much to say about the Galaxy Note 8, if the people wants a full review go to you tube and go for it. I'm with the family of the galaxy notes, my first smart phone was the note 2 and still I'm with them, no other device from other brand, Samsung is the company which I follow since 10 years ago, and I'm not thinking in change it for others 5 or 10 years."	1
"As an entry level phone, it&apos;s just ok. there are too many better products on the Market for a less expensive price,technology has advanced so much that this now seems like a clumsy basic &apos;smartphone&apos;"	0
"As an old iphone user, I love my new phone. Screen is super and very sensitive especially black contrast is amazing. The phone is very light and thin, I am gonna buy case to increase the grip. Battary life is same as Iphone 3gs. Its not that much but its ok.   For, operating system, I love using widgets and syncing my google contacts and facebook contacts together and adding profile pictures near to my contacts.   I recommend this phone."	1

"As expected with ANY used cellphone past its time, the battery falls faster than new. But, it functions just as good as NEW! I love that I am able to use Samsung Pay and wirelessly charge! I upgraded for my S5. These features are fantastic and make the shorter batter life not an issue at all! It's slim and powerful. <3"	1
As expected...  Works great.  Arrived fast. No problems.	1
"As far as it being a flip phone-it flips.  The volume is a real problem.  Only one ring tone that's barely a tone at all.  The size is nice as is the display; however, barely hearing the ring outweighs everything else."	0
"As far as phones go, this is an okay one; small enough to fit comfortably in one hand, though it does have a fair bit of heft for the size. Those who are transitioning from a feature phone like the Nokia 2610 can use this to learn the basics of working with a smartphone. With that being said, the Google Play Store is so massively out of date that it cannot be updated to the current version; which means that you're basically stuck with the apps exactly as they are. While the user interface is fairly snappy and responsive, simple apps like texting are actually really slow (specifically, the keyboard input portion). And battery life wasn't really that great either, at only 3.5 to 4 days on a charge (assuming minimal interaction). Granted, this is the Republic Wireless version, which keeps WiFi on all the time; and who knows what kind of keep-alive tactics they employ for maintaining the WiFi calling connection.  All in all, I'd say that this is a fairly decent stepping-stone device, maybe for an older relative who's stuck on a non-smartphone. Or it may be a cheap first phone for your kids. But personally, I can't use this as my daily driver; mostly due to the limited functionality of the outdated software, though the battery life is also a major issue."	0
As far as small form factor I have no idea what that meant. The HTC One has a lot of good features but it some small problems. It always shows up ( unfortunately HTC service pack has stopped) You have to update it then uninstall it again. But all in all its a good phone and I have bought 2 of them I bought this one for 130.00 from ultrapageinc in perfect condition. They have 5star ratings in my eyes. Great phone for those who have hearing problems	1
"As good as new, no scratches or marks of any kind"	1
"As I was looking for a phone, normally I see phone with scratch and damaged screen. But this phone was in good condition almost as described. and had original photos. It was bit expensive than other phones but price was ok with it. So i am happy of which I bought. there was nothing dislike about it."	1
"As it says in the title of the review, this is 100% false advertising! Completely untrustworthy. "	0
As it&apos;s still remain in excellent cosmetic and good condition. Item just exactly as described and reasonable price.	1
"As long as you can connect to wireless, you can use internet without using minutes. I pay $24.16 a month total for 3 phones to pay for service and 120 to 160 minutes per phone.  Has triple minutes if you want to add more."	1
"As long as you realize it has limited RAM and isnt intended to run a dozen programs i  the background, this phone is amazing.   It arrived exactly as described, and I was very pleased with the preloaded software."	1
"As most of Latin american countries, carriers of Ecuador use same frequencies as AT&T and T-Mobile in USA. So this SM-N900A version is the perfect one for Claro, Movistar and CNT in Ecuador. What is very important is that the device must be UNLOCKED. And the device is great: huge storage, excellent camera, tablet display size, fast procesor, nice shape, and hundreds of features. Fantastic."	1
"As much as I like blackberrys, virgin mobile really brings out the greatness in having one with their beyond talk plan. Usually its $25 a month, but for blackberrys its the extra $10 you need to pay, or $35 a month. The price isnt much compared to many other carrier services, especially for a blackberry. I really recommend this phone, for virgin service especially."	1
As my last upgrade was stolen I was stuck with an old Soni Ericcson.  When this one arrived people were saying I sounded a bit muffled.  I put this down to DPD chucking it around the van.  I must have been right as its working wonderfully now and is far better than my old phone.  I can use all the applications that I pay for in my 3 contract and think its FAB!  Thanks! Meow_!	1
"AS noted the poor man selling the phone had post office mail problems , he mailed it to me and 3 to 4 weeks later still no phone arrived , so he addressed it with the post master as he sent it priority mail . On my receiving end he was very polite and issued me a full refund via pay pal . Thanks for asking as I had to purchase a new lg shine 720 from my local phone co at no charge for extending 2 years on my phone agreement @ A .T.T. Good old ma bell phone co.  The phone is great."	1
"AS OF 04/2016 this phone is antiquated.  The on screen keyboard is awful the space bar is very small so you end up sending texts with dots between each word.  The slide out keyboard is even worse same issue.  The phone is slow to power up at about 1.5 minuets to boot.  Battery lasts about 8 hours if I don't use it (I don't anymore I have it forwarded to a Galaxy).  Everyone I talk too on the phone says they cant understand me so sound quality is poor.  I purchased the phone in excellent condition whether new or refirb IDK.   The price is great if you can forward it and not have to use the hardware.  Works for me (I just needed hardware to activate a line and knew that in advance,) but in case you are considering it for everyday use - you'll be disappointed and most likely frustrated.   "	0
As of Sept and Oct of 2018 you will not be able to activate these phones through Verizon. I just bought one and had to return it because both the lady at my local Verizon store and a sales rep on verizons help line told me they would no longer activate any 3G or early 4 G phones. 	0
"as of today it satisfied me more than what i expected. let me see after a month of use since my previous products with different vendors worked till their warranty period , after that its gone. so would take time to evalute this but i have 100% hope on gazelle."	1
As of today my phone it is working relly good...  I took the phone in to Mexico and works perfect!  Wifi running fast and the best of this phone it is super light...	1
"As of today, May 29, 2007, Seller refuses to send refund.  I paid for shipment both times.  Says I should&apos;ve done more to make the phone work; AT&amp;T technicians couldn&apos;t get it to work.  He is a cheat and a liar.  He said he would refund my money if I sent back the phone. Stop this guy! I&apos;m sure I won&apos;t be the last person he cheats and lies to. The phone was advertised as an AT&amp;T/Cingular phone; but was never intended for that network.  It was a T-Mobile phone."	0
"As other users have mentioned this is a great texting phone. I&apos;m a former BlackBerry user only because I&apos;m a very light data/web user do I say former user. This ZTE Adamant is the perfect fix if you&apos;re like me &amp; want the look &amp; feel along with a full keyboard for texting like a BlackBerry. This phone runs on a simple phone brew platform &amp; process, so me &amp; my girlfriend, who also downgraded to a simple phone, were able to get our Verizon monthly bill amount down significantly on a simple phone shared data plan. ***An important technical note*** Due to a recent Windows 7 update, Microsoft OS from Vista forward will not communicate with the software on this phone. The workaround for transferring ringtones, wallpapers, etc is to activate the email trial in the apps section, email what you want to save on this phone to the email you set up on the phone. Before you send anything over, insert your memory card to this phone, go into card memory, format it to this phone, and yes it&apos;s going to wipe it so be forewarned, and select yes to have everything saved to the card. When you then save your email attachments (ringtones,pics,etc) save them to the card &amp; then select the option in the folder on your card to send what you want to the phone. Not as involved as it sounds because I exhausted every other possible step to transfer media to this phone &amp; nothing worked, Verizon level 2 tech didn&apos;t have any answers for me either so I emailed myself attachments &amp; saved them &amp; Voila !!! So again if you want a keyboard on what&apos;s otherwise a flip phone on the inside, &amp; is global with a sim card slot, I&apos;d highly recommend this gem from ZTE."	1
"As per today I didn&apos;t receive my phone. The phone is missing, the seller stated that he shipped the phone, but it never arrived at my address in Miami."	0
"As professional reviewers have said, a great phone for the money. Activated on T-mobile with no problems. Screen is bright and gorilla glass hard. Screen size is a good compromise between visibility and size. I find the 5"" too small to read easily and the 7"" too bulky. Only minor drawback is that memory is smaller and gets filled quickly with apps (I'm not a huge app user). Even with an SD card you can't transfer most apps to the SD."	1

As soon as i got the phone I had charging issues and I delt with it because I loved the phone and I spent 250 dollars on the phone and just after a month and a half of having the phone the motherboard fried and the seller told me it's past the 30 days and it's only 2 weeks over the 30 days and I get  nothing .. I'm very upset with this purchase so I wish I never bought this phone. Don't get it because the phone is worthless. 	0

Also, in the first pic as well, theres no notch at the top, and the text on the screen doesnt look like how apples text is. Your selling a fake iPhone in the original box for almost $1000?!?

"at a reasonable cost. It's fast enough, cheap enough, with triple minutes and a years worth of minutes for $120...Tracfone site would have cost $200 for same thing "	1
At first  it was great it worked but after 2 days the screen went black and will not work . U can her sounds but NO picture. Nothing happened on my end I had it in my hand when it happened. But I bought a used product so thats where I made a mistake on my part. Lesson learned 	0
"At first glance you&apos;d never guess that the 6280 is a 3G handset. Yes, it&apos;s a little on the fat side, but hey, it is a slider, and it doesn&apos;t look much thinker than non-3G phones. 3G might not even be the killer feature for you -- there&apos;s an FM radio, a 2-megapixel camera and it&apos;s all easily accessible without opening the slider"	1
AT FIRST GLANS YOU ARE THINKING THIS RETRO PIECE OF HARDWARE IS NOTHING LIKE THE NEW PHONES THAT KEEP POPPING UP. AND YOU ARE RIGHT. THIS PHONE IS THE SAME SIZE AS A RAZR BUT ONE AND A HALF TIMES THE THICKNESS. BUT THESE ARE GREAT THINGS FOR THOSE WHO ACTUALLY LIKE TO HAVE SOMETHING TO HOLD. AT 3G SPEEDS EVERYTHING IS NOW NOT LATER ON THE NET OR JUST TEXTING A BUDDY. OH AND IF YOU HAPPEN TO DROP IT? IT WILL BE FINE UNLESS THE FRONT SCREEN HITS SOMETHING SHARP WHICH IS NOT LIKELY. NATURALLY IT STILL IS NOT A GOOD IDEA TO THROUGH TH PHONE ACCROSS A PARKING LOT. &quot;BOBOE&quot; LONG LIVE THE RUGBY. THE NEW &quot;RAZR&quot;. BY SAMSUNG	1
at first i didnt like the phone then after how many times i have droped it and it hasent broke in anyway i have grown to like it and it was cheap	1
"At first I had problems with this phone cutting me off and people that I called not being able to hear me, but when I learned how to fix that, I love the phone.  To fix that problem, I just cannot let my text messages get too close to 100."	1
"at first I like the item because the price is just with in my range. But when I receive the item its not worth because its to outdated. However I just just have to contend with it. Charge to experience. The unit is now standby . Not being used. If seller wants it for 50% less, I am willing to sell at half the price I pay"	0
At first I purchased the iPhone 7 and was disappointed by its lack of features verses the iPhone 6s. I originally had an iPhone 6 Plus. The 6s was much cheaper and to me was still on par with the iPhone 7 I recently returned. Thanks apple!	1
At first I really luved the phone but it started to freeze up and then have a bad delay when changing screens-- then 3 screens would show up and then couldnt do anything--	0

At first I thought the phone had a power defect because it wouldn't turn on while charging and I didn't see the charging indication screen. I decided to charge it over night and it turned on and got to 100%. The batter lasted a decent amount of hours so the power is fine. The screen was broken (stated in description field) and it had scratches too (also stated in description). Great deal!	1
At first I thought the phone is great but it is very disappointing. Memory should be 4GB and it is far from 4GB. Apparently the internet on this phone supports the generation of two but not the third generation support. So the Internet is very slow when phone is not connected to wi-fi. The camera&apos;s flash is very weak so you can not take pictures in the dark is very disappointing to have advanced things like photo while video quality is poor but I expected a lot better	0
"At first i thought there was going to be a problem , but the seller contacted me right away to explain the delay and for that , I&apos;m really impressed.                 THANK YOU"	1
"At first I thought this was exactly what I&apos;d been looking for--a simple, inexpensive phone with a nice long battery life. Less than a month after purchase, the battery started dying within 24 hours. I have no idea why, but I&apos;m very disappointed."	0
"At first I was pleased because they were very quick to get it to me. It arrived in a few days. But, when I tried to activate it, it didn&apos;t work because apparently it&apos;s already activated with someone else! Still waiting for a reply from the seller. We&apos;ll see what happens."	0
"At first I was very pleased with the product until one day it shut off and when all the restart techniques didn&apos;t work, i gave in to a technician to have a look at my phone, but when he opened it he found that phone was refurbished, one of the battery&apos;s screws was missing and the other was damaged. I&apos;m not an expert in cellphones but since then iv&apos;e had three technicians try to fix it but the phone is simply dead, and I find it hard to believe that it has nothing to do with the unoriginal pieces of the device."	0
At first it seemed nice untill connecting to wifi. Then constantly losing signal unless literally standing on top of router. And even then extremely slow. 	0
"At first it seems like an okay phone, however upon close inspection, this phone is very difficult to use and will not work very well (especially with obvious T-mobile Users). It&apos;s difficult to get signal and it uses up battery without any efficiency. Do not buy this phone if you are looking for an alternative."	0
"At first it was fast and fresh, however, after couple days of usage, the phone started to lag and going more south and south. The keypad would just freeze or shrink into extremely small size into a corner and can not be pressed, which resulted in forcing to have to hang up the call and re-dail again...the three dotted main page buttons are pretty in design, but it just doesn&apos;t sense that well at all..on the description it says the glass is gorilla glass which is scratch-proof, but it got scratches just the second day after I got it. I usually don&apos;t tend to favor writing reviews, but this phone is really disappointing. Plus, the seller didn&apos;t seem to have a good customer service, when I emailed the SELLER about the problem, he/she TOLD ME:&quot;YOU HAVE TO FORCE SHUT DOWN to cure whatever problem you have...&quot;just not a positive experience afterall."	0
AT first it worked perfectly. Then it turned black & white. And dropped calls halfway through. It did have very very long battery life. 	0
At first was it great .after 2 days off using it. It became very slow.. and the battery drain very fast 	0
at product a little slow on shipping but overall super satisfied!!	1
At the moment am enjoying the services this product is giving me. 	1
"At the time being, these phones average $40. Raise they have a $15 data charge in order to use it, but it&apos;s functions are out dated. Pay a little more for a better BlackBerry. Save your self the stress."	0
"at the time of writing, i feel that it is worth the little bit extra you would pay over the 3G as it is still getting updated on itunes, and still a great phone to have if your budget can not stretch to the 4G"	1
"at this time, the seller no deliver my cellphone. es mucho tiempo tener que esperar por el telefono. le escribire al vendedor a ver que pasa con el telefono y cual es el status,."	0
"At&amp;t carrier and the fact that this was the one my daughter picked out!Great for texting, and that is a plus because teens can burn up a phone!!Trust me. lol! Awsome sound! Excellent camera......honestly, better than my iphone 3gs(apple needs to work on that!)Small, dainty, more for a girl than guy.I have a 19,16,14,14,and 10 year olds and they have gone through some phones!Great value and price for around a hundred dollars,I paid 107.00 for a barely used one on ebay!Teens will love this phone.Very lightweight, but seems to be durable, I have good luck with like 5 out of 6 Lg phones, my mother gave them out for christmas last year."	1
AT&T (Cingular) Retired their 2G Network more than a year ago - I took mine in to an AT&T store and they confirmed that this will not work on AT&T	0
"AT&T could not set this phone up.  However, a did receive a full refund on return without any problems!"	0
"AT&T informs me that this phone CANNOT be activated as the SIM CARD is already active in an account somewhere else. Therefore it is useless unless i buy another SIM card so what's the point of my paying for this one. This is what happens when the SIM card and other info is on the OUTSIDE of the box. I don't know about battery life as i never really got to use the phone.but the instructions are incomplete as to accessing some functions. All in all this is a total POS, a total waste of money and time and the seller should be ashamed to offer it."	0
"Aticulo, especificamente un movil da�ado, vendido segun el en buena condiciones,  "	0

autofocus didnt work.  battery got hot and very short life.  Otherwise seemed like a great phone.	0
Average product for a replacement for a short period of time.  Product tends to jam up alot and cause alot of drop calls.	0
"AVOID - scam liar seller avoid at all cost This seller and Straight talk wireless - they both are a scam, this seller lied, zero integrity, said works with all major carriers and straight talk, then changes his advert, after the sale to say locked with straight talk.   locks their phones for 12 got that TWELVE MONTHS  folks,   rip off liars, now way ever   avoid at all costs"	0
Avoid at all cost!!!!! Seller took too long to ship item. About a week and couple of days after I had purchased said item. The seller either didnt ship the item or they labeled it with the wrong address. I am out of $500.00 and unable to do business because of this issue. The seller will not communicate with me either. Avoid at all cost	0
"Avoid this guy! The Ad describe the item is &quot;New, sealed&quot;, but I got a used or re-built phone. Try several times to ask exchange. No reply! If you want to get money return, you will be charge 15% restore fee and deliver fee!Cheating!!!"	0

Avoid this seller! Sold me a phone with a broken microphone!!  Scammer!!	0
"Avoided Apple as too expensive many years.  Now that almost any flagship phone is going to cost $1000, gave the 7+ a try. Phone works great integrates into CarPlay in my car well.  Android Auto has never worked well in my car. Love the longer update periods as well.  Samsung and Google want to charge you a grand for a phone and stop giving you updates after 2 years. I have seen people rockin iPhone 6 with latest version of iOS. That phone came out in 2014. Also updates are straight from Apple to you.  No waiting for ATT or T-Mobile to update the update!"	1
Awesome  Thanks  	1

"Awesome phone!    I changed to this from iPhone5s. And I was surprised that how good this phone is.  Ok, it does not work with Apple&apos;s other products and there is lot to work to get use to this Z Ultra.    The main thing why I changed to this is the screen size. I have a big fingers so I had great many times misspellings with small 5s screen when trying to write something.    And the biggest issue I have come up with this is that android does not communicate with Apple&apos;s ecosystems, like at all. At least not properly.    And somehow there is this annoying feature with android. It duplicates all my contacts and I can&apos;t get that corrected. Maybe it is some malfunction on this phone or maybe it is feature that android does have in it.    I have a slight issue with data waveband&apos;s. Phone has 4G LTE. And I have only 3G what I use. But when data transfer is needed it drops straight to 2G as lowest and it so slow. Too slow. I haven&apos;t figured out why so. And also the wifi is slow.    This phone is the international model C6833 and I think the problem is either on settings or that the phone has got some damages on delivery.    And with this issue I&apos;ve had a great help with the seller. They are helping me to resolve the problem! And I&apos;m sure that this issue is going to be resolved fast.    But in general the phone is good to use. It feels good in hand. It is water and dust proved so i don&apos;t have to be so extra careful with it when it starts to rain and stuff like that.  Big screen is awesome. It might feel weird to hold on your ear (I hate bluetooth hands frees because they last only month or so and you need to buy a new one) but it does not matter cause the other features are so awesome with it!    And what comes with hands free I prefer to use those &quot;REAL&quot; car phones that are mounted to car like for good. And I&apos;ll just use call transfer so I get to use brilliant sound quality through my car&apos;s speakers and so on. And at the same time my new Z Ultra can work for me as navigator. SUPER!    I can&apos;t tell is android better or is iPhone better. Both has their own features and qualities and I will be using both of them in the future. Maybe I&apos;ll buy iPhone 6+ or maybe I wait for the S version or the iPhone 7. But that is for sure that I will be using this Z Ultra for a long time as my dailydriver."	1
"Awesome phone!  I bought couse I need a new htc phone, and I made the right decition! I just have a few days with it and think Its amazing!"	1
Awesome phone! Definitely recommend it!	1
"awesome phone! I had a galaxy 7 but it couldn't hold a charge for long and kept dropping calls. This phone galaxy 8 is a better upgrade, with louder volume, faster downloads, and a battery life of 12 hours or longer with frequent internet use. I can go all day and most of the night before needing to charge this phone. I was nervous about ordering a phone online but was recommended to use this shop and seller. I have been very impressed with the phone!"	1

"Awesome, just like the original iPhone, but faster and prettier.  The retina screen is beautiful.  It makes my lockscreen with Megan Fox wearing Armani underwear look great.  This is my 2nd iPhone 4 - Once you start using it, you can&apos;t go back to older, slower, less resolution iPhones.    People say its just &quot;another Apple scam&quot; but its not - its just as great as the original iPhone - but again, faster and prettier."	1

"Awful experience with the seller. He sent me a phone and it was not new. Nothing dood. Don't buy again. Never, never."	0
"Awful experience. First, they sent me the wrong phone and made me pay return shipping to send it back. After receiving the correct phone, it was incredibly defective. It would not update to the newest software, it heated up like crazy after minimal use, the battery drained exponentiallly, and most of the times I could not dial out or receive my calls. After filing a complaint, they authorized me to return the phone for a full refund which I did immediately. However, they still have not issued the refund (it&apos;s been 3 weeks) and has not responded to any of my messages. eBay should shut this business down. I would give them 0 stars if I could."	0
Awful seller. Did not respond to 4 messages. Received return. Never gave refund. This guy is a thief and con artist. Despicable  	0

"Back in August 2012, I purchased this phone from CELLPHONE FOREVER and It reached me damaged.  I am with TMOBILE and the phone said AT&amp;T which is a problem straight off the bat (although the seller specifically stated that it was unlocked tmobile phone) The product itselt was $85 and like i said, it was damaged, it wouldn&apos;t even turn on without being plugged into the charger, and even then it only turned on long enough to show the AT&amp;T logo then it would shut off.  I returned the phone to the seller, and per their request sent it first class WITHOUT confirmation so there is no way to track it and the seller keeps telling me they haven&apos;t received it and they can&apos;t give me a refund.  It is now DECEMBER and I am still out of $85, and a phone,BUYERS BEWARE FROM THIS SCAM!!!"	0
"Back when I got this phone it was 2005. I was amazed that a phone could work with itunes, and the phone I had previously the V180 didn&apos;t even have a camera. So I was happy to receive and use this phone. It was amazingly durable, and an amazing phone altogether. I dropped it and even got it wet a couple of times, resulting on the lights on the sides for some reason to flash sometimes, but besides that little issue it all worked. I gave it to my sister when her phone broke, she got it wet, and then the battery failed about a year later.    I would still get this phone, but I LOVE my iPhone better"	1

So person who lied and sold this phone as a smartphone you are bad, ebay you are good for saving the day and selling me a phone I can actually use for $99.99 and to the person who kept nearly $30 of my hard earned money, you can suck it!  Sincerely, K."	0

Bad purchase.  The phone I bought was not able to be used because the seller never canceled the service in his name so the phone was no good to me when it arrived.  I tried to get it activated but they said I couldn&apos;t because the service was not officially canceled by the previous owner.	0

"Bad things: bad hardware. in one week after purchase loudspeaker gone damage itself (warranty replaced it). after a year display gone damage (not broken) I paid for replacement afterward charging microchip on mother board gone damage (I paid for replacement). By calling after half minute some noises and interruptions. have received an update from android 5.1 to 6.0 after 1.5year, when other phones got android 7. Good things: one of the best interface (ZenUI), software newer gone hanged or stopped. very fast working software."	0
"Bad,bad,very bad!!!"	0
"BAD:  WIFI BLOWS- does not stay connected for longer then 30-50 seconds. huge problem. there apparently was an app that fixed this but the android market banned it. MOTHER F**KERS  GPS- lags hard  HEADPHONE JACK: stupid .2mm, a normal(standard) headphone jack is .3mm, you have to use thier 2$ crackerjack headphones or buy an adapter.   BATTERY- if you use the internet do not expect the batter to last longer then an hour.  POORLY CONSTRUCTED: back is held on by flimsy clips. everytime the phone is dropped the back and battery will fly off. even on carpet.  GOOD:  EBAY APP: awesome.   MEMORY CARD: takes up to 16 gig flash card. (really only 5gigs are useable. anything above that and the phone cant get anything done. thats still plenty of space for music)  MUSIC PLAYER: awesome (cannot edit tracks)  INTERNET: works suprisingly well. 3g is awesome when service is available. even the 2g is fairly fast.(2g is alot fast then wifi because of aforementioned problem)  CAMERA: 3.2mp works great WITH good lighting. however you cannot move at all and the no flash is a poor design."	0

Barely any reception in downtown Chicago. Went back old phone and everything was fine.	0
"Barely any room, can't switch micro sd to internal storage"	0
"Barely functioned, even for its time. half the time, it would not let me answer the phone or call out."	0
Barely functions	0
Barely over a month of daily use and it stopped charging the battery and seems to be completely unresponsive. Just vibrates and doesn't turn on. Better already didn't seem to be doing great out of the box but I was willing to tolerate it for performance vs price value. Shame phone is already completely useless.	0
Basic and not exactly what I would call stylish but does provide great protection if the phone is dropped.  	1
"Basic Android phone that is smaller than the large screen phones for those who need the smaller size. Clear phone connections, pretty easy to use, and with TracFone service, very cheap. Pretty much does what it claims."	1
Basic phone with walkie talkie feature. You can also use this phone as a tracking device with the right program for a very inexspensive price.	1
Basically by having this phone I can make about 40-60$ a week because of having a good phone.  This phone has a faster chip than Samsung models so it can receive data faster. If you do uber/ DoorDash/ lyft that's definitely necessary.  The camera is advanced so if you do ibotta and shop kick you don't have to circle around for scans it'll put it through immediately.  There's also the fact that you can leave this thing on without charge for 6-8 hours and have it play videos for those marketing apps and get free money since it'll load it faster too. 	1
"Basically just a first gen smart phone,but so simple to get used to,nice screen,keyboard helps if you dont wanna use the touchscreen,camera quality could be better,but talking to anyone on this phone is great and so is the three 3g,would recomment to anyone looking for a simple but nice android phone"	1

"Basically this phone never worked even though it was advertised as new. The seller did quickly agree to refund my money, but the cost of shipping and time spent going to sprint store trying to activate was inconvenient. I found this quite annoying seeing it was the third phone purchased from ebay that didn&amp;apos;t work properly."	0
"Basically, a family member and his GF upgraded phones and got the android Galaxy S Fascinate. He knows I am into gadgets, and I helped him set it up. I had my iPhone next to me when I was doing the set up, and doing a comparison, I&apos;d say this is Verizon&apos;s iPhone, however I think that the iPhone is still the best out there for AT&amp;T unless I get a different phone and find out otherwise.    PROS:  The phone has a big screen, and has a swipe text feature, which would be you&apos;d start to type a word, it pops up with the suggestions and you swipe through them.    Social Networking, FB and Twitter are easily used on this phone. Amazing for that. I am just used to the iPhone&apos;s FB layout and I&apos;m wondering if the FB layout on this is any different. He doesn&apos;t have an FB so I couldn&apos;t test.    CONS:  A little big of a phone, def bigger then my Jest and iPhone, but you should get used to the size once using    Battery, goes down fast with touchscreen. Overall 4.5 phone"	1
"Basically, as the third Pantech phone that it has been my displeasure and misfortune to own, this is a waste of time, circuitry, and my patience."	0
"Basically, the phone that was sent had a damaged screen. I thought it would be brand new, I guess not"	0
Basiclly it would have been a nice phone. this one was used&amp; the price was reasonable but as it turned out it did not work. the keypad was inop and from the moisture tab in the back it was exposed to moisture. The seller was quite good to refund my money. If the phone was new ithink it would have a good phone	0

Battery life 100% at 11am by 8pm it was 8% in that time period all I did was check the time & email. Junk emails only & they were deleted. Other features of the iPhone ok but with a short battery life the iPhone is practically worthless. 	0
Battery life 12+ hours.  Fast processing. Superb camera.  Only objection is the fragility of the screen - so one must get a good case with proper edge protection.	1
Battery life beyond your wildest expectations.  	1
Battery life could use improvement but other then that I was very happy with it. 	1
Battery life good. Value was very good. Would recommend this product if you just want good solid phone for texting and everyday phone use.	1
"Battery life is awesome with the extended battery.  For some reason the phone wont recognize the wifi at my church, I believe this is a Sprint Issue but not the phone issue. My home wifi no issue.  My biggest problem is locating a case the will work as I need it to.  Some fit too tightly, some only with components I did not purchase, case hard to find outside of ebay, others from ebay not so good on fit.  Phone has a great feel, not too big, (didn&apos;t like the thin feel of Evo 4g lte). When I find the right case I will be ecstatic."	1

Battery life is days and days and days. The audio is analog...SO...you don't get cutoff during conversations. Make sure you get the one made in Korea. Rev 1	1
"Battery life is horrible.  I live in a weak 3G area and it sucks the battery life away.  Unable to disable 3G to save battery life life like previous Android phones I have owned.  What&amp;apos;s the point of having an Android of you need to turn everything of to have the battery make it a half day, if I&amp;apos;m lucky.  I used an iPhone4 for 6 months in the exact same issues and never had battery life issues.  I&amp;apos;m not an Apple fan boy, actually I am more of a Google person but this phone just would not make it even a half day on a charge.  To high maintenance for me. A dead phone is worthless.  It let me down several times."	0
battery life is less than half an hour & i can can never get any bars of service	0
"battery life is supposed to be 100 hours. but that battery used one lasts only 10 -20  hours. That is if i don&apos;t use phone call. if I used it was half day.  So I tried to buy new battery. But I could not find new battery in US. I am Japanese and I emailed to NEC customer service in Japan head office. They said that product was not sold in Japan. That is in China products.Then I had contacted the office in Hong Kong. They said that was old model, and already changed to new model because it was not popular there. So I could not buy new battery for that or don&apos;t use that anymore. just waste money because seller didin&apos;t tell the truth."	0

"Battery life terrible. Screen freezes up, Had to remove battery at times and restart to get this phone to work. I now see why they are selling cheap. Drops Wi-Fi constantly,  When you receive a text message all you see is the contact number and not the senders name. Save your money."	0
Battery life was no good. Not made well. Feels like plastic. Slow phone too. Stop charging at 50% never went up higher. Will never buy this phone again.	0
Battery looses it charge as soon as I pull it off the charger! Not using it and letting it sit for 5 mins its down to 85% battery life! Then goes down pretty fast after that. Dies even faster when using it too!	0
Battery may not be that bad since I listen to music although it`s usually plugged more than not  Big problem is the low audio volume.  I have the ringer turned up all the way set under sounds/ and turned all the way up on the volume buttons on the left side. Is there any other way to increase the volme?	0
Battery no good. I contacted several times.  No reply	0
Battery No. work I had to buy a new  .......................................................................	0
"battery not last long, It's very colorfully golden."	0
"battery of the phone is damaged, the charge center too, is locked means that cant use it in gsm network"	0
Battery of this phone is completely unacceptable. It goes from 100% to 20%  under little to no use in only 2 hours. I would not recommend this phone. I will be seeking a refund. 	0
Battery only last 16 hrs. Cheap glass cracked 4 days after I bought it. Poor reception. This is one of the worst phones I have every bought. I will never buy another Samsung phone again.	0
Battery only last a couple hours and phone shuts off at 30% battery. The in call microphone does not work can not make phone calls without using a headset or speakerphone	0
Battery problems day 1 and a week later it won't start up. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY	0

Battery seems to deplete quickly but otherwise works well 	1

battery swelled up back cover wouldn't stay on	0
Battery takes longer to charge than what it last	0
battery very poor  the phone is ok  but i liked my old one much better	0
Battery was bad and the screen was replaced and asked.  Also wrong color bezel which makes it a unit that won't be accepted by carriers for upgrade.    We returned it.  Will  update review once money is returned by the seller.	0
"battery was dying when received,died in a week another poor product, are we all surprised they are virtually out of business ??"	0
"Battery was faulty, would like a refund"	0
Battery was great. But it let me down in performance. Side keys were not placed right. You touch them by mistake all the time. Pages will take 3 to 4 minutes to load. Phone is not fast at all. I was not happy at all and wont recommend.	0
Battery was in such bad shape it wouldnt even turn on. I had to pay for a replacement battery and then it worked fine. 200 was a deal for 164 gb but having no battery meant I had to wait a while longer before I could even use it. Dont let them send you one like they did me.	0
"Battery was low. I tried charging it, it is no longer charging the battery. I have 3 extra backup batteries, just in case I don't have access to where I can charge the phone, and I am in Florida, where we have been without power for a week. It's smart to have a basic feature phone with extra batteries. The purchase didn't even last me a year, not even into the Hurricane season. I wrote to the seller, and I didn't get a reply."	0

be aware buyers i just got scammed from a seller like this be aware 	0
Be aware of this seller	0
"Be aware that not all iPhone SE's are the same.  There are several different ""unlocked""  models, and some vendors on eBay give incomplete descriptions, some descriptions are even erroneous.     In the end, you need to check the IMEI of the individual phone to be relatively certain it will work with your preferred provider.  Even then, you won't know for sure until you pop in the SIM."	0
BE AWARE!!!Do Not Buy from this seller!!!!  i bought nokia N95. after one day of receiving this item it stopped working and when i talked about the refund they told me to send the item and they told me to spend my own money for shipping level and still i haven&apos;t get my refund.	0
"Be awere! They are selling refurbished phones ar brand new ""unopened""!!! "	0
Be careful  possible scam. She canceled order  and want me to pay from another link to avoid eBay fees. 	0
be careful advertised as new and oem  .. i dont believe it	0
"Be careful buying anything on eBay. The seller told me it was new when it was used. There was an account locking the phone and I can't get in. Phone is of no u se to me. Contacted seller. He stopped replying after second attempt. I contacted eBay thinking I would get justice, they don't care, would not help me get my money back. I have a $380.00 brick. Good bye eBay. "	0
"BE CAREFUL OF THIS COMPANY IN CHINA, WHY I CHECK THE SHIPPING NUMBER THEY CAN'T FIND IT. THEY SAID 10 TO 15 DAYS. TO USA. THIS TRUE I DON'T GIVE  BAD RATING."	0
"Be careful on buying from this seller the phone it's not new. It seems but it's not. When you get the phone, it will have a lot of emails on it from the seller and the front microphone doesn't work such as Siri will not work. "	0
Be careful to buy her this man sells counterfeit things phones are not Authentic Samsung Galaxy	0
Be careful wasting your money  the funny  part is that DELL is not helping at all  http://en.community.dell.com/support-forums/mobile-devices/f/3824/p/19485457/20286086.aspx#20286086	0
"Be careful when buying these phones. The state that its new and sealed when it actually is NOT...Check the sellers negative feedback and it will be clear if its actually new or not... I received my phone and it looked brand new and was in a sealed box but then i realized.... The phone i purchased was 64GB and the Box said 128GB. Then i opened the box and the phone looked great, definitely looked new until i checked the IMEI number of it to find out that it was previously used for an entire year on a network and is Blocked by the carrier.  What these guys do is buy these phones in Bulk and hack them with a different Firmware to make it work and change the back cover to make it look NEW. THATS IT.. DONT FALL FOR THIS SCAM LIKE I DID. THIS WAS A BIG HASSLE AND A WASTE OF TIME!!! ONE OF THESE SELLERS IS  ""excelic.store"" BE CAREFUL!!!"	0
be careful when looking at this phone from anyone. you cant use this phone without the sim card and boost will not sell you a new one so the purchase was useless. i think the seller knew this prior to listing it on ebay. when i asked her about it she said it was listed with no sim.	0

Be PREPARED to carry around your charger with this phone as it is only good for about 3.5 hours on a full charge.  	0
"Be truthful to people else your life is short. Thanks. Why do you sell a locked phone to me,claiming to be unlocked? "	0
"Be very careful about, what you buy. they are very tricky in their statement and product they sell. i brought a unlocked samsung galexy s6 phone phone, I put my T mobile sim and it didn't work. Now they say even all the frequency were mentioned and says, GSM unlocked, it works only with Sprint.  Beware of what you buy. think three or four times before you buy."	0
"Be warned! I already reported this seller to Ebay after I bought the phone but never received it. Seller posted invalid tracking number and never replied to my messages. Suddenly he/she cancelled the transaction without my request, gave me partial refund and kept the balance. Ebay had to intervene. Again be warned! Dont trust this listing. I hope Ebay will take action against the seller soon."	0
Be wary. This price is too good to be true. 	0
"Beatiful design, easy to use smart phone, preloaded music, downloadable applications along with the preloaded guitar and instrument apps.... just an great phone. Texting isn&apos;t as hard as older touch-only cellphones. call quality is good."	1
Beats the new iPhone 8 Plus at all aspects.	1
"Beaucoup de bug, probleme avec l&apos;ecran, pas genial du tout. tres lent, apareil de photo tres basse qualite etc..."	0
"Beautiful and sleek in form, with quality in design and manufacture. It seems user friendly but can be a little daunting for the first time smartphone user. However, since there on numerous free user friendly video guides posted on u-tube, you should find yourself mastering the devise in no time. I love the built-in stylus; It keeps the screen smear free and its pinpoint is easy to use. I purchased my phone NOS (new old stock) at just a fraction of what this flagship sold new, and it is not all that different from in looks or function from the current flagship model Note 5. So if you don't have to have the most current Samsung Galaxy Note, or don't have or want to spend that kind of money, this certainly is a smart and thrifty way to go."	1
Beautiful phone and pretty much perfect condition. It came with some of the plastic still on it- impressive. Its been working wonderfully since I received it. Thanks! :)	1
beautiful phone but limited feature I would prefer tohave purchased the galaxy ii or the newest one this one is outdated in my opinion. I didn&apos;t care for it to much at all	0

"BEAUTIFUL PHONE, WORKS GREAT!!!!"	1
"Beautiful screen; nice and responsive; so far, good cell area coverage. Stylus works as shown.. You can scratch the exterior quite fast if you do not get  a cover.  ..so far, i can't quite find a negative to the Straight Talk service and the Phone, or the phone itself.. .. *shrugs*.. "	1
Beautiful! Got this for a good cheap price. I use it with AT&amp;T prepaid! !So cheap and everything works great!	1
"Beautiful, flawless, activated with no problems and came with charger and charging cable. Was delivered sooner than expected also."	1
"Beautiful, no issues months later. "	1
"Beautiful, small, powerful smart phone that compliments my two Passports. Would highly recommend for those that need a small form factor! Especially at this price !"	1
"Beautifully designed and solid phone. Best look&amp;feel combination, due to it&apos;s thickness feels awesome in the hand. Let&apos;s not forget the water-resistance and the battery-save mode. After using several Xperia models I even found it&apos;s software being more stable compared to Samsung S2/S3. Well done Sony!"	1
"Becarefull , this phone isn't as described. It was used and defective . I contacted the seller and he accepted the phone back and refunded me. Wast of time"	0
Because battery doesn't stay charge long	0

"Because if you&apos;re an apple, then you&apos;ll love this phone. you&apos;ll love the crystal clear display. you&apos;ll love the hd recording. the speed, the sound, the apps and the way it feels all sexy in your hands.   If you&apos;re a spoilt banana, you&apos;ll crib about it and lean towards the androids and humanoids and all the other droids that you can find.  so hear hear. I&apos;m an apple.   and I LOVE IT."	1
Because it a very good product and I love it.	1
Because it came from Isreal and does not work in the U.S. AND it did not say it was coming from out of the country. What's up with that???	0

THE MORONS SELLER SENT $800 CELLPHONE WITH ""NO SIGNATURE REQUIRED"" AND WAS STOLEN.  ITS BEYOND COMPREHENSION HOW EBAY THINKS SOMEONE SHOULD PAY FOR SOMETHING THEY HAVEN'T GOTTEN !!!! "	0
because my phone is broken  . I like this phone and easy to use  . This product very cheap than other phone  .	1
"because of it being cdma, it doesn't work any carrier that has a sim card, so it cannot work in Europe or most places overseas either"	0
"Because of the seller advertising the phone is unlocked, I purchased this phone to replace my other now destroyed one to use with my current carrier (T Mobile). AT&T and T Mobile both use the GSM network, and with the phone being unlocked there shouldn't be any operational issues. The phone arrived, I put in my old SIM card, and everything seemed to work properly until..  In a couple of days, I no longer had access to any mobile data (ie, no longer could go online), the reception would show full bars, but I would drop calls or the calls would be choppy, etc, and texting would sometimes not even work! I literally could watch the signal strength show ""4LTE"" then drop to 1 bar, then full bars all within a minute!  These problems did not happened with an official ""T Mobile"" phone. I assume it is because the phone I purchased is an official ""AT&T"" phone using a T Mobile carrier service, even though it is supposed to be ""unlocked"".  So buyer beware! Although they say you can use an unlocked phone across any GSM network, it is not true!  They should make a law prohibiting phones to be ""locked"" in the first place..what a pain!"	0
Because the jailbreak doesnt even work none of the apps I have downloaded even work.	0
Because the seller cannot communicate properly.	0
because the seller gave everything i need to know about the item. The Nokia 2720 is perfect...and the seller was clear with the his/her answers.	1
Because this product has 3 big dents that it was not mentioned 	0

Been using HTC for quite a while but this specific 816 Desire is amazing!   The speakers are perfection and the LCD display & color quality is perfect (still better than the iPhone.)   Only con is 8gbs of internal space but you can add a micro sd card.  I've repurchased this HTC because none of their competitors are as great as this little guy. It's simply fantastic even for 2018!	1
Been using it for almost a month with no problems.	1
"Been using LG's for the longest time because they have always seem to be the best fit for me....my last phone was a G2 until it died and I still wasnt too thrilled with the pic quality. I wanted at least the galaxy 6 but when the new laws screwed me out of my new every two contract, I had to buy a new phone. So far, so good with this one tho!"	1
been using this phone for years - - -does just what I want it to do!!!!!!   Great price !!   Simple to use.- - Still plenty of them out there	1
Been wanting this phone for a long time! Now I finally have it thanks to ebay! The phone is everything you could ever want in a phone. Love the fact that it is a touch screen and also has internet. And for someone that isnt very internet saavy this is a great phone.	1

Before I begin I tend to have a habit of buying phones to learn how to repair and I like having a small device to play games on as to not wear down the phone I use to make calls with.  I already owned a few of the original Torques and wanted something with a slightly more up to date OS.  Two primary problems that I can't recommend this phone to.  The first is that the battery level is never accurate.  Either it drops too quickly and hangs at 1% or when charging it stops at 60% and jumps to 100%.  I know it's not the battery as I've tested them on their predecessor.  The second and most prominent problem is that the eMMC corrupts.  Which eMMC module I don't know as this is the only phone that has  4GB and 16GB chips.  Simply put it gets stuck at the boot logo and a hard reset does not get it working.	0

Before I bought this phone the specks said unlocked when I got it it wasn't unlocked. Then like a week later all of a sudden the screen is freaking out where you can barely see anything on it. Only a bunch of lines and half of the screen is black with line running through them. I really regret buying this phone.	0

Before I purchase a product from eBay. I read the post thoroughly. I purchased an iPhone from this seller the cosmetic conditions were nearly perfect but the hardware of the phone was garbage. I purchased the iPhone for my YouTube videos and Snapchat social media. The front facing camera worked fine the back camera showed a black screen. Immediately frustrated I did all the troubleshooting I could to no avail than finally I contacted apple they did a diagnostic check numerous issues camera sensor was a fail ambient sensor fail Touch ID fail battery fail they told me I might need a replacement device which will cost me $329! Returning the device is very inconvenient since I already put my service in it. Im devastated. I think the seller was very dishonest I wouldnt purchase anything from him. I learned my lesson	0
"Before I purchased this item it said on its description that this was an unlocked phone, however when I received it and installed my own SIM card from a different carrier other than Verizon the phone not only it doen't recognize the SIM but it will not work at all.   contacted the seller and they tell me that the phone is locked to the Verizon network and it will no work with any other network that is not of what their network is.  Very dissapointed! "	0

"Best blackberry for the price, small, powerfull, gooflooking and faster. Wifi if a excellent feature to keep in touch outside od the roming areas, Handsfree an charger are standard so you can buy cheap and easily accesories."	1
"Best Blackberry I&apos;ve owned! I have been a diehard Bold line consumer for the past 3 years, starting with the 8800 World Edition up to the 9700 Bold 2. After my 9700 screen breaking, I found the only new devices available on AT&amp;T were the Torch, with its fail of a keyboard, and the Curve 9300. I was surprised to discover that the Curve 9300 serves my needs better than any Bold! Camera with 5x zoom (sans flash unfortunately), WiFi, Micro SD slot, headphone jack, dedicated media keys. All this and faster than any other Blackberry I&apos;ve owned! Only thing that may be somewhat lacking is battery life, but anythings better than an iphones battery life, right? I cannot see a new Blackberry device trumping the Curve 9300 anytime soon."	1
"best BlackBerry phone yet! It works great love the OS 6.0 big improvement over the 5.0 and previous OS. ease of use, and I combine both uses the screen and the keyboard! I do not need 10000 apps to say this has enough free ones thru Blackberry anyway.. I have downloaded about 50 and kept about 30 loaded.. Camera and video is improved! love the multi functions for the camera, of course not a subsititue for my nikon but I do not feel so bad if I leave my nikon SLR home. I recommed this phone and the 9780 both are great phones!"	1
"Best budget phone i have ever seen, processor is ultra fast and i can do now than thing at the same time, the camera is perfect and screen has hd, i used it with Verizon and it works with any gsm network worldwide, i love this phone"	1

"Best cell phone I have ever used. Excellent clarity, signal strength and crisp speaker phone. The construction and feel of this phone are stellar. Kudos to Motorola for this one. Am ordering another one today....this will be our third Razor. We are replacing a Samsung and two LG&apos;s that broke and or underperformed."	1
"best combination of technologies and  aesthetic that money $250.00 can buy ! (include the new one plus X)  . OPPO must  improve distribution , advertising and technical support (update) if they want continue to expand ."	1

best Iphone ever.....................................................................................................:)	1
Best of the best	1
Best of the best I like Apple iPhone it&apos;s very easy to use it. I like iCloud. Good camera and processor.	1
"Best of the last Smartphones with replaceable Batteries. So much better to have a couple of genuine OEM batteries on hand on your trip when you can't find a place to plug in your charger. Newer phones all have built-in batteries that require you buy a bulky non OEM external battery or a Bulky battery case like a MofiPak or other. Good for WiFi calling and as a Mobile HotSpot, too."	1
Best phi ne they have made yet 	1
"Best phone and OS I�ver used. Very pleased with its speed and overall performance. ICS 4.0 Rocks!  Coming from Gingerbread 2.3, ICS shows better performance, smoother transitions and great new UI with plenty"	1

Best phone ever created	1
"Best phone ever made, old fashioned but reliable and easy to use, it does what a phone is supposed to do, makes and receives calls and sends messages, does not take photos, that is what cameras are for, no internet, that is what computers are for. The less tewchnical the phone the less there is to go wrong and these do not fail. Love this phone."	1

best phone ever.... its easy to use.. confortable.. and has all the caracteristics i was looking for in a phone.. the bes thing i could get for the price..!!! absolutly the best..!	1
"Best phone for me so far, beautiful pictures. outstanding performance. The LG G3s design is a safe one that wont polarise opinion as much as the dimpled back of the Galaxy S5 does, but at the same time wont gain the plaudits of the solid and refined metal HTC One M8. And while LG has managed to keep the G3 as trim as possible for a phone with a 5.5-inch screen it is still a very big phone. If youre used to sub-5-inch phones we recommend you go in store and try it before buying, particularly if youre planning to add a case for protection."	1
Best phone for the money i spend	1
best phone good looking unlock features give it to freedom to use any sim card. slide a feature is nice also the touch screen is very nice. highly recommend it to everyone.	1

"Best phone I&apos;ve ever had! Came from an iPhone 5s and I love my new Z10. It&apos;s so easy to use and the BB hub makes switching between apps a breeze. The BB store is full of useful apps to run your business and not too many game apps to waste your time. If you want a business phone, blackberry is the one you want!!!"	1

"best reception inside cities and outside(rural areas), have used phone for 10 years and very durable.

Best smartphone for the money 	1
"Best smartphone on the market! I call it my &quot;phablet&quot;. Yes, I said &quot;phablet&quot; it is a phone and it is a tablet all in one device. Battery life is fantastic! Features are amazing! There are so many that I learn a new one everyday :). The camera on this phone is awesome! I have no complaints at all on this phone. If you are looking for a smartphone that is capable of internet surfing, taking care of your Ebay business, and getting you from one location to the next while messaging your friends and talking at the same time, this is the phone! I highly recommend the Samsung Note II to everyone and I promise you will not be disappointed!"	1
"Best smartphone out there!  simple, but yet stylish. i&apos;ve had this phone for about 3 years now. talk about durability, i dropped this nokia critically for a million times till  now, and it still works like a tank!...very cheap and reliable. And the Music ROCKS!"	1

BEST THING EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	1
"Best thing is the sound quality.   My wife had one, so I got one also.   I still have the old phone, data and internet for 25 a month plan which they will keep going as long as you are on 3g.    I may buy another as a backup.  It is not listed on Virgins site anymore,  but is still covered."	1
"Best Touch Phone under $400(with out contract), Fully customizable-easy to use touch screen interface (Android 2.1), has a qwerty slide out keyboard ,has a 5 mega pixel camera with flash which is awesome. The best part is that it has the same processor as the IPHONE 3G which makes the my touch 3g slide SUPER FAST, Big difference in the speed if you upgraded for the t-mobile g1 like I did. The only problem is battery life, but you can fix that if you buy the 1750mah DROID ERIS BATTERY by SEIDIO, you can actually find the battery on ebay that&apos;s how I got my battery. So overall very good phone, just buy that 1750mah battery from SEIDIO and the phone is perfect. YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!"	1
"Best Tracfone I have had to date, not sure why they are a little hard to find much better than the LG 800G my son has this one and it is not as nice to use, smaller screen, just do not like as well as the Motorola EX124G"	1
BEST VALUE FOR ANDROID PHONES 	1
Best windows phone on the market to date. Love all Samsung phones. I would recommend this Samsung  SGH I937 to any one wanting a windows phone. You cannot go wrong. 8mp camera. 16gb of memory.	1

"BEWARE !!! He is a lier and thief!  I received a pathetic, so called holster.  Headphoes where missing, driver software missing and instead he placed a silly DVD.  Phone if defective.  To deal with him was an awful experience that I regret dealing with a dishonest seller with low morals."	0
"Beware anyone want to buy with seegs2323 seller. This seller promise to have items in ""MINT condition"" with no cosmetic defects or any kind of issue, but you will receive a expensive item with a lot of cosmetic imperfections like scratches, paint off, wear and tear, dents etc etc. Please don't buy with this seller at least you want a more than 300$ garbage of this seller. The best of all is after to receive the item the seller will say you are a liar and won't want to help you to solve the problem. "	0
Beware Beware Beware. This seller does not tell the truth about his items. I recieved a broken Item from him and he told me that I could not return it. He took my mony sent me a defective product and di not mention that his sales are final with no returns. Plus he does dot stat that his product is sol on a AS-IS basis. Be Very careful if you buy from this seller.	0
BEWARE DONT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!!  THEY SELL STOLEN PROPERTY!   I contacted them with proof from the National Data Base for Stolen Cell Phones!!  They REFUSE to Refund my Money!! They are CROOKS!!!

"Beware of this seller!! They money was received as the item was purchased, but it was never shipped and there has been ZERO response to my repeated requests to remedy the situation. eBay is now stepping in to take care of the refund. Dont bother trying to buy from this person. It will waste several weeks from your life!"	0
BEWARE OF THIS SELLER; HE WILL REPORT YOU FOR ANYTHING!!!! DOINT BUY ANYTHING FROM HIM	0
"BEWARE PHONE PURCHASED WAS STOLEN  Purchased the phone. Verizon advised that it was reported lost or stolen by the owner, Cleveland Clinic. I contacted a detective at Cleveland Clinic Police Department. He confirmed the phone belonged to them and had been reported stolen. Seller was advised. Asked me to return phone. I explained that I could not due to its status of being reported stolen. Phone was sent to Cleveland Clinic PD. If I or seller would have retained possession then we could have been charged with receiving stolen property under Ohio law. I forwarded detective's info to seller. Called detective today and seller has yet to contact him. Seller said he would issue a refund through PayPal. He did however he abruptly cancelled the refund so I am out the $155 plus shipping. Seller has not made this right. See photos below. "	0
"Beware seller was a nightmare. Phone had debris in speakers, volume issues, seller didn&apos;t want to refund all of my money. Lied several times, didn&apos;t want to give me a full refund, said it was his phone, then said he knew nothing about phone.  Held up my money for extensive time till paypal fully refunded my money."	0

BEWARE!!! Seller never sent item after two weeks said paypal didn&apos;t clear the money on her end and wanted me to wait another week never heard of that in 10yrs using ebay/paypal	0
"Beware, fake xperia. "	0
"Beware. They will not let you return it if it's not still in the box or in perfect like new condition.   Don't buy this, as the case they send it with is literal plastic trash. If the phone drops, the front screen will be damaged and the projector segment is likely to lose durability.   This is a cool gimmick, but don't fall for it."	0
BEWARE...make sure when purchasing a phone from ebay to go to the companies website and check by the IMEI number to see if the device you are purchasing isn't locked or stolen. I made the mistake of rushing and purchased a device I couldn't even connect because it was a locked device by Metropcs. Hopefully I can get this issue resolved without having to escalate the situation.	0
Beware..starts off good..then about 3 weeks into it...screen starts getting stuck..slow..will be typing a text message and it kicks me out to menu screen..calls wont go thru..too many negatives to list..	0
big bottom keyboard good for people handicap  in fact it hasn't speaker phone 	0
Big phone which I like for video. 	1
"Big phone, fits great on most hands and with a bright screen that is great for entertainment. Excellent processing power to simultaneously run multiple apps and large HD video files without breaking a sweat.  My battery lasts anywhere from 4 to 5 hours with heavy usage and about 3 times that with low to moderate use. "	1
Big scammer. Warning	0
Big screen with expandable storage. Also has a fast processor and ram. 	1
"Big screen, great battery "	1
"Big screen, modern specs, all at half the cost of a typical flagship. Mine upgraded to Android Nougat (7.0) OTA right off the bat. That also upgrades EMUI to 5.0.1 as well. If you are a US user you may need to change country settings for some apps. I recommend downloading a different keyboard like Google's for the same reason. All in all I'm happy with this device."	1
"Big thumbs up for my seller PagePlusDealer. They must sit up during the wee hours waiting for wayward orders to come in.. they had it on the road by 6 am. Phone purchased for talk, text and pics. Phone gets A+ on all accounts. Simple quick call to Straight Talk, my # switched over and I was rock'n & roll'n in Minutes. Ordering a second one now as life has taught me when something fits just right get Two as they'll be Unavailable when you finally wear it out and look for another! Ordering a case immediately as I want this baby to last a Long Time in the cup holders of trucks, tractors, atvs, and the misc contents of my pockets on any given day. "	1

"Blackberry 10 is amazing, Apple iOS runs well on the hardware, but you have to deal with Apple's walled garden. Android is a jack of all trades but a master of none, and performs poorly on all but the most powerful of phones. Blackberry 10, and more specifically the Q10, is an example of a device in the middle, BB10 is designed to run on the Q10, Z10, etc. And it runs exceptionally, however unlike apple, blackberry is friendly and inclusive to power users, allowing for side-loading, tweaking, high security encryption, and much more. BB10 combines the ease of apple, and the power of Android, it's a shame more devs don't support it. The blackberry q10 was a top of the line phone for 2013, and by today's standards still easily holds it's own with 2gb of ram and a snapdragon s4 plus processor, it is no slouch, and never crashes, or slows down. It just works, if there is one thing you can take from the q10, is that."	1
BlackBerry 7780 - Black (Unlocked) Smartphone---EXCELLENT --PHONE THANKS C!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	1

BLACKBERRY BOLD 9930 8GB IS THE BEST IN SECURTY OF ALL OF MY ACCOUNTS FROM 401k-Mortgage-BANKING and JUST HAVING FUN BROWSING THE INTERNET SO IT DEPENDING ON YOUR CIRCUMSTANCES BLACKBERRY IS THE BEST FROM BUSINESS TO JUST MAKING A CALL......	1
Blackberry Bold is a very good phone. I have been using touch screen smart phones for a few years now. I finally got the urge to try the Bold and I cant say enough about it. Battery life is the best thing. It has all the functions of the touch screen phone yet the battery last way longer. I am now hooked on balckberry phones...	1
Blackberry has a superior speaker phone for my father who has a degenerative hearing problem. The voices are amplified very clear and is the ONLY phone he can use. 	1
Blackberry has been manufacturing reliable cell phone.. My cousin and niece are very happy with this phone because its features and pocketability.	1
"Blackberry Hub was still alive with Android OS. I felt that the key touch of PRIV is shallow, but it doesn't matter if get used to it. For Japanese input, SwiftKey is recommended!! "	1
"Blackberry passport. was one of the best phones? Ever made. However. The sad part is. It is no longer supported by Blackberry. Which means this phone will be heavy? Paper wait. Not worth spending too much. Blackberry. 10. Will no longer be available? Fortunately, that's the sad part."	0
BlackBerry still make the most modern cellphones even if it's 5 years old. I'm glad I got this one before it disappears for good.	1
"Blacklisted phones, they wont connect to any carrier. I requested a refund in the form of an exchange for a working phone but after a week of waiting they just refunded me my money without any notice or apology. Now i've been without a phone for 3 weeks and i am back to square one, save yourself the headache and buy from a reputable distributor."	0
"Blazing fast with 6gb of RAM. This is more than a phone, with uncompromising processing, very good camera (front & back), and a battery that based on my usage I charge every second day. "	1

"Bom como consumidor n�o tenho que reclamar donproduto. A estrega foi extremamente rapida, o produto chegou lacrado e em perfeitas condi��es. O que tenho a falar � que se for brasileiro n�o compre. Paguei R$ 2400 em impostos. NAO VALE a pena, fiquei muito desapontado por que n�o sabia que as taxas eram t�o elevadas. Era melhor ter comprado na Americanas. Estou desapontado. Se desse tinha concelado a compra."	0

"Bom n�o sei por onde come�ar, mas vamos l�, o aparelho � realmente incr�vel, mesmo sendo um snapdragon 808 com 3gb de RAM o aparelho desempenha muito bem as tarefas do dia a dia e outras mais exigentes.  A �nica coisa que realmente me decepcionou no aparelho � o fato da atualiza��o para Android 6 estar dispon�vel apenas se o usu�rio tiver um SIM AT&T, mas na internet se encontra modos de atualizar sem o SIM.  Recomendo o vendedor e o aparelho, deixarei a resenha em portugu�s para os Brasileiros e em ingl�s, pelo Google Tradutor.  Well do not know where to start, but come on, the device is really amazing, even being a snapdragon 808 with 3GB of RAM the device performs well the tasks of everyday life and more demanding.  The only thing that really disappointed me on the device is that the update for Android 6 only be available if the user has a SIM AT & T, but the Internet is ways to update without the SIM. Recommend the seller and the device, leave the review in Portuguese for Brazilian and English by Google Translate."	1

Both before and after doing all upgrades to phone the home button and touch screen are sometimes unresponsive.	0
"Both phones were defective and had to be return. My only concern is that the return was at me, other wise i got back my money."	0
both phones were junk even though were brand new.  they both had different problems that make them unuseable.  the seller did not warranty either.	0
"Both the Ocean and the Drift are excellent devices. The Mysto is also nice. What I like most is that you can have multiple phones and switch them at anytime online. We have great service and they always have an answer to all your questions. Now if you buy one of these phones flashed from Cricket etc. you will not have the internet or instant messaging, that isn&apos;t right because Cricket has an ok service plan. ty J.B.J .....the Ebay prices for back up phones ,like I have 2 Oceans and don&apos;t have to wait for my other phone to be fixed, if I ever have a problem with the first one are great."	1

"Bought 2 for a trip, did not arrive on time as was listed in posting, seller made excuses.  one would not turn on, and the one that did was formatted in a foreign language.  Be careful buying this product  I returned both for refund"	0
"Bought 2 of these and both have died on me within 1-2 months. They were rarely used too. It all starts (and ends) with the phone not being able to hold a charge. I say end, because that's pretty much it for this phone since the battery is not replaceable. Not worth the money. Also did some research and found out this kind of problem is common for this phone. Wish I knew sooner. Better save your money , unless you want a 1-2 month working phone."	0

Bought a NEW Satin Pink RAZR.  It came with the language set to Italian. HAd an old version of the firmware. The battery wouldn&apos;t hold a charge.  The paint started to rub off of the phone in several places.  Within 4 weeks the display hinge pin fell out.  The sell refuses to do anything.  In my opinion this phone was a refurbished phone and was not using genuine Motorola parts.	0

"Bought a new SEALED one.  Inside the box, there&apos;s no manual or instruction booklet. The battery was half charged.  It seems repackaged/re-sealed.  It worked for about 20 minutes the day received. Then, stopped working and never could be turned on again.   Seller&apos;s advertise saying this is not a bad korean version and this is a good international version.  However, this international version stopped working the very first day received."	0
"Bought a Panasonic GD55 that was supposedly factory refurbished to &quot;new&quot; condition. I wanted a small tri-band GSM phone to take with me to Europe. The phone was unacceptable. The battery pack would not latch on and fell off the phone.  The plug-in connection for the battery charger did not work.  The LCD screen was dim and blurry.   The phone was returned to seller for a refund. As this was a refurbished product, my experience might not be a fair review of a new GD55. Reviews I read prior to my purchase were very positive."	0

"Bought a phone that the seller stated it had no contract and was ready for any company. I got the phone and set it up. But once I place a SIM card there was no connection. I called my company which was T-Mobile and they told me it was locked under T-Mobile end. I immediately contacted the seller and he/she stated why was ""I"" lying. Just to tell the truth and that I didn't want the phone already. That is because he would have a case with eBay and he could of charged me 20% of the price. This seller is a ""Scam artist"". Buyers BEWARE! DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!"	0

"Bought a used blue/silver vx8560 more than a year ago for my daughter &amp; it performed very well. Now I use it (got her a Samsung Brightside at AmazonWireless for $0.01 hehe) and have been pleased with the features. The mp3 player is nifty, I like the &apos;phone-closed&apos; operability, the Bluetooth connectivity, the SDHC card memory, and the look. Also have fun with animated gifs on BOTH screens. The camera is low-res but color is true and you can adjust exposure with a side-button, and zoom with the dial-wheel quite easily. I found a deal on the extended battery and back cover for that too &amp; while it&apos;s a bit bulkier, the battery life is GREAT! All in all an attractive, useful and inexpensive phone for them not on a data plan."	1

"Bought advertised as ""New in Box"" and while it was mostly sealed and seemed to be new in box, it often will not charge when plugged in to any form of charging method. Phone shows as plugged in but battery settings show ""not charging"":  I have reached out to the sellers and not received a word back. I will need to dispute this charge in Ebay and Paypal if they do not make this right!!!!!"	0
"Bought an iPhone from this seller a few months ago and there was a bright spot on the screen which he told me about before I bought the phone I just took it to the Apple Store because my Siri couldn't here me, turns out the phone was water damaged and the screen had been replaced so they couldn't fix it and I had to buy a new phone. Waste of my money "	0
"Bought an LG g4 from this guy. The DC module is broken and the phone only sometimes charges. We have no backup phone and dude refused to give us a refund or send us one we can swap for.

Bought as new but turned out to be used.	0
Bought based on the specs at the AT&amp;T site. Made the assumption that it would be like the Nokia 2320 it was replacing only better because it has 3G. Boy was i wrong. The first major issue for me was that you can not connect it to a computer to transfer wallpapers and ring tones even though that is one of the things it lists in the specs. There are no games on the phone and you can not install any from Mobile Rated or anywhere else. The specs say games are available at the AT&amp;T app store but there are none listed. Apparently this phone will not run any Java apps. I could not install Opera mini or Google maps like i could on my 2320. The phone comes with one wallpaper and one ringtone and no settings for individual or group ring tones. Also no way to change the phone navigation settings and it will not receive MMS messages. So there is no way to add your own ring tones and wallpapers. I visited two AT&amp;T stores in my area and got no help what so ever. Both places said well it is a cheap phone. I replied that i paid the same price 18 months ago for my Nokia and overall i can do more with it than the U2800A. I have had to deal with AT&amp;T four times in the past year or so with poor results. Since there are sales quotas to meet by the employees each month they really do not want to be bothered with service issues especially if you are a Go-Phone user. I do not recommend AT&amp;T or the Go-Phone service.	0
Bought because it is rugged. It appears to be a very well built phone. My husband is very hard on phones.  I seen this one and thought I would give it a try.	1
Bought because of Google tango but had mixed feelings because of the reviews. I like large phones for business as i a camera installer and like a big screen. I can also demo products easy with the large view. Had specs similar to the new note 8 but better camera pixles. Anyway here is a real honest review from someone that buys allot of phones and not getting paid to trash other brands. The phab 2 pro doesn't really seem much bigger than the note 8. Fits nice in my jeans and pocket. I love when people ask what kind of phone I'm using really cool to show them tango. Anyways to make a long story short the screen is amazing colors are not a sharp as they are on some of the Samsung or apple but really after while you don't notice it it takes super sharp amazing photos the daytime but forget about taking them at night. The photos are not greedy at night you just can't see them very well I'm sure if you got them Photoshop you can make look really good but again we all know we take tons of photos on our phone but never really look at them to who cares lol but I can tell you the daytime pictures or absolutely fabulous. The Dolby surround town and playing music its incredible you actually think it's from a small desktop stereo and games sound amazing so would I  buy this phone again ? abs	1

Bought my exclaim directly from sprint about a year ago. During that year it froze constantly despite several firmware updates and hard resets by Sprint. After about a year the device stopped charging and began constantly rebooting. I purchased another exclaim on Ebay along with 2 brand new Samsung OEM batteries and device came rebooting similar to my original. I took both devices to a Sprint repair location and they agreed that both devices were defective. I looked up problem online and found that many others have the same problem I have with their Exclaim. A friend of mine has a new Samsung phone with many problems as well including constant freezing. It seems that Samsung make attractive innovative products but clearly the quality leaves something to be desired. I will certainly think twice before buying a Samsung phone again.	0
"Bought my LG600 a couple of years ago, and it&apos;s still going strong!  It&apos;s compact, lightweight, and durable.  Fits easily in most cell phone holsters, but it&apos;s not that bulky to just carry in your pocket.  The battery lasts almost a week with moderate use.  Folding flip style keeps the screen scratch-free.  Has an easy-to-use camera feature, Bluetooth, and more."	1

"bought Nokia for my good lady wife because it is nice to look at different, and easy to use.Priced right and nor too big for her bag."	1
"Bought one almost exactly like the old one I was replacing.  I had the old one for a few years--it developed wear &amp; tear on the hinges over time. I like this phone for three reasons:  (a) keypad characters are large and easy to read --don&apos;t need corrective lenses to see them.  Display on the screen is also large. (b) My new phone is actually slightly larger/heavier than the old version, better built. It looks like the problem with the older version was corrected. This phone is heavy duty.  You can drop it and it won&apos;t fall apart easily.  It is well-padded; (c) It doesn&apos;t have a lot of unnecessary confusing bells &amp; whistles.  This is a phone&apos;s phone, a working man&apos;s phone."	1
Bought one for my daughter and liked hers so much bought one for myself.   Very impressive features and the upgrade lollipop operating system is outstanding 	1
"Bought one for my son for Christmas. It arrived in perfect condition & if it was used before, you couldn't tell. So my son got the phone he wanted & in like new condition for a great price. Will definitely buy from the seller again. Very happy with the phone! ! Works perfectly. "	1
"Bought one for my teenager son who spends a lot of time fishing and wanted a rugged water resistant phone text use friendly. He loves it and it has been dunked a few ties, I feel better because now he always has his phone on him as he is not worried about it geting wet. This phone gets reception when his old one never did andwe can stay in better contact. The battery life on tis is incredible.I played with his a little and because of his experience with it I bought one for myself and so far I just love it. About the only complaint I have is the size compared to the 6 year old flip phone I had, it fit in my pocket nice. Other than that this phone is just great and easy for a old fart like me to use easily."	1

Bought Product as backup phone and because I like idea of Firefox OS  This phone is terrible! Cannot sync contacts. gmail works but aol does not.  Manual setup of e-mails lacks basics to actually work. Active sync cannot import/ accept certificates so it is useless.  ZERO support from Firefox or ZTE (ZTE told me to contact E-Bay to get software update!!)Firefox said its not their problem.  They are NOT updating software.  Minimal apps available  Camera works but at 2 mega pixels it is marginal.	0

Had to pay and return the faulty phone $20 and waited for a new one for an even longer time.  Ended up spending twice as much to buy and return it."	0
"bought the BRIGADE three weeks ago and was immediately impressed with the number of features available on this phone. It has a 3M-pixel camera, video camera, and speakerphone. The size is perfect for carrying in a pocket and the battery has a pretty good lifespan. My only complaint is that the menu system on the phone makes you click four times before you can find someone in the address book, set an alarm, or perform a additional functions. Other phones I&apos;ve owned have simpler menus and get you to important features easily. Overall, I&apos;d recommend the phone."	1
"bought the HTC Touch2 three weeks ago and was immediately impressed with the number of features available on this inexpensive phone. It has over 3-pixel camera, video camera, and speakerphone.

"Bought the phone (&lt;$20) to use as a small android tablet so I can&apos;t comment on the actual phone performance but is fantastic as a small tablet/MP3 player. Has blue tooth, GPS, &amp; Wifi. Nice to put on music and bluetooth stream to the car radio or use as a GPS. Better than most MP3 player out there. Decent sound out of the speakers."	1
"Bought the phone about 15 days ago for a gift. Acted dumb by never actually trying to make a call or to call it, now that its activated I found out that the sound on it doesn't work at all...."	0
Bought the phone and contacted the seller twice. (NO REPLY) Spent 1.5 hours with Verizon tech. Spent hours on my own. This phone will not communicate with your computer. There is no driver available online or in the phone to download or upload data from or to your computer.  Casio's website does not have the driver. Do yourself a favor and research this phone before you buy. Or just don't buy it!!!!!!!!!!! :(	0

Bought the phone for a elderly friend in a nursing home. Phone was unable to turn on at times but when finally on there were only black lines all down the screen with some black marks down the sides. Screen was not attached to phone as it came off easily. No charger for phone. Per seller she would not return the money as her description said no accessories and that some damage to screen. Had to buy another phone for the friend. Waste of my money.	0

"Bought the phone thinking it was a good deal, but come to find out when i went to get it activated, i didn&apos;t have any problems, but they told me that these phones had recalls on them.  the display stops working on it... well, shortly after i got the phone the display stopped working.  they person i bought it from no longer has an ebay account, so i&apos;m out the $22 for the phone, and then the activation fees for the new line...all it all, i would NOT recommend this phone!"	0

Bought this &quot;unlocked&quot; one for my wife as I have an original from T-Mobile store.  Big mistake to buy anything &quot;unlocked&quot; in my opinion as the phone has been glitchy from the moment it arrived.	0
"Bought this a little over a month ago based on good reviews and Samsung&apos;s reputation.  I must have got a lemon because it performs very poorly. It was good for maybe a week.  Blank screen for hours at a time.  We&apos;ve tried to be patient and give it time, then got busy and  I waited too - can&apos;t return.  $80 down the drain. Very confusing to contact the seller, so I have to leave this review."	0
Bought this and discovered so many problems water damage n all kinds of issues the sell stiff me with a piece of shot phone then I ask for a refund n got 40 bucks outta 225 not only that I have 400 dollars n repair on this device so u do the math that almost 700 bucks I could have got a s7 edge for that much be very careful   	0
bought this and it was to be in perfect working order and it was not. it had water crosion on the inside and was not able to pick up sprint&apos;s signal. had to pay for return shipping and still have not had funds restored to my paypal acount. this is the second Iphone purchased from Ebay that was deffective . The first one was stolen and have not recieved mt money back yet on it and that was over a month ago. there 100% money back is not true. so buyer beware only buy from 99.9% sellers with good feedback.	0

Bought this as a birthday gift for my 16 yr old son. He just started opened it yesterday and loves it. Activation was great and moving his contacts/pictures etc fromhis old phone to this phone was a breeze. Phone is in excellent condition too - looks new!	1
"Bought this as a Christmas present for my wife. After a month of use my wife is very happy with it. It&apos;s fast, shoots really nice pictures, and the battery lasts reasonably long with normal use, but they are cheap to get replaced, so for me it is not a big deal."	1
"Bought this as a gift and found it to complicated to set up, Waist of money."	0
"Bought this as a much needed replacement phone for my son. He said this is a much better phone then the one he has been ""tolerating"" which was a Galaxy S5Active that has become sluggish over the years. He said on the S7 Active that the camera is better, the battery last longer, and it is a much faster phone. If he is happy with it, then so am I. Thank you!  "	1
"Bought this as a refurb unlocked, says Tracfone and Straight Talk. Both use AT&T network. I have another iPhone with an AT&T SIM. This ""refurbished"" phone works in every other way but will not authenticate on AT&T. So it is unlocked? Doesn't look like it. It should just work. The other possibility is that the original owner didn't remove it from their account. Wither way I wasted like $120. Tried to get input from thee seller but the responses were to look at the ad. It also has two different configuration codes one in the headline and another in the description. "	0
Bought this as a replacement phone for my child. Instead of upgrading my plan. Good value for the price.	1

"Bought this because i Had just broke a couple phones in little more than week and a halfs time, needing     a tougher phone and being low on cash at the time this seemed like a good call. While it hasnt died from use yet, right off the bat i had to buy a battery as it would shut down 5 minutes off the charger  And it constantly freezes and crashes. It did arrive fast and appear practically brand new for whatever that&apos;s worth when its constantly having issues with rage inducing slow load tim.es and freezes."	0

bought this because the description said it was fully functioning and I take it to US cellular and they tell me that the internal antenna is broke and it won't work at all. And fixing it will cost more than the phone is worth. Waste of money!	0
"Bought this brand new phone for my son as a gift. As soon as he got it out of the box he said I think this is a fake phone. Sure enough after looking up how to determine a fake phone on  utube. It was difficult to tell, but it definitely wasnt authentic. Will never buy from them again. "	0
Bought this cell phone and the first red flag was moto-lenovo cell phone. Oh boy! Motorola sold there soul on this one. Bad blinking flashing and restarting and off then would not correct after factory reset back to the same blinking and flashing. Only lasted out of the box about 3 hrs. 7.0 os android with a mixture of badly overstated performance. LOL just flat out to screwy to work with. I own an old moto-x that works great. Not this model my next cell phone will be LG why take a chance on all this handed around add this and that to a junk phone and call it Motorola when it is not. Lenovo what the hell that ever is.	0

Bought this for my 13yr old niece for Christmas. Great price- the device is in great condition. I havent activated it yet but will be as the holiday approaches. Money well spent!  	1
Bought this for my 14 yo as a replacement for his older slider. It's great-all the features of a smart phone but doesn't have to have a sim card to function (if you want to restrict data/internet). And they can still use it like a tablet with wifi. He's very happy with it and I'm getting another for his younger sibling. Add a generous sized  sliding keyboard for texting while over all size remains compact and plenty of accessories still on the market.. This a great phone for teens!	1
Bought this for my daughter for Christmas to use with Ting service.  Had no issues bringing into Ting&apos;s BYOD program.  She loves having an iPhone	1
Bought this for my daughter. She loves it. Works good. Plays you tube videos... Facebook and talk and text good. Speaker works good for hands free.... So over all a decent phone for the money....!!!!!	1

"Bought this for my grandson. He loves this phone, great for texting, nice features, fast OS, quality product."	1
Bought this for my husband and he really likes it!  Charges quickly with great battery life during normal use. Love the feature in which it list the name and numbers that has VM and you can choose which to listen to by touching and it even list when the phone is off!  I'm a Samsung girl but I do admit this is a nice phone!	1
bought this for my mom to replace an older Samsung and it seems to be working fine so far	1

"Bought this for my nana, it took a lil while for her to get the hang of it but she's doing well now, and that thing packs a lot of power for the small price tag, I highly recommend it!"	1
"Bought this for my smartphone savy daughter which worked  fine in receipt. However, it began to have  issues then stopped making/receiving calls. Think the  seller knew there was a problem reason to sell. Closed case before accepting proof . So cannot give a critique on the phone itself for  having less than a month that it worked."	0
"Bought this for my son who already had a SIM. This is a great phone, and it functioned just as the seller described. Perfect!  Our SIM worked fine with it!"	1
bought this for my teenager and it works perfect for her. She also loves the color of it!!	1
"Bought this for the price and looks. Used to own a T-Mobile Razr V3 &amp; loved that little phone. Once the proper settings installed for T-Mobile. this one works very good. Excellent volume levels, excellent external speaker-this one being the 1st that actually sounds OK, beautiful finish. Only issue I would have is with the back panel latch. Doesn&apos;t give you a satisfying click, wonder if it&apos;ll stay on.   Excellent phone, would buy again.      Update 2.22.11     After checking this phone out for awhile found that it is actually a Razr V3xxRJ, which is an updated version. There is also a V3xxR.  I flash firmware a lot and was only able to find 1 for this particular phone. Even though the sticker under the battery says V3xx.  There&apos;s a lot firmware for V3xx but not my version. Only way to find out which version you have is to connect to Flash&amp;Backup3. Sellers are probably not aware of the different versions of the V3xx. If your buying to flash, fair warning.  Once I got the AT&amp;T crapware off the phone, love it even more. This will be my every day phone, and I own 6 others.   Absolutely the &quot;BEST&quot; external speaker I&apos;ve ever heard. Really sounds good for a phone. and pretty loud too."	1
Bought this inexpensive phone for my elderly parents.  They never used it but let the charge run down.  Phone wouldn&apos;t charge after that...took to Sprint to see if was charger or phone...it was the phone.  I guess you get what you pay for and too late now to return for refund.	0
Bought this iphone only to find out it doesnt charge when it was listed in perfect working condition. Then I go to contact the seller to work something out and they simply ignored my messages. This is ridiculous there's fraudulent scam artists are still able to sell on here. If your buying anything from this seller better make sure that it isn't electronic because they can't seem to tell how to properly post things or correct their mistake...instead your met with pointless dialogue in ebay messages only for them to ignore you in the end	0
Bought this item as a gift for my mother that would give her peace of mind while driving alone and something easy to operate.  While setting up the phone for her I found that it had more options etc than expected and found it to be a fantastic buy at a bargain price.  Most recommended for more than just a basic phone as I oringally thought it would be.	1

"Bought this item on 04/10, seller provided tracking number 04/11. Items has not shipped, it's now 04/13. This seller did the same thing to another person on 04/08. This is a scam, do not pay for the phone being auctioned now."	0
"Bought this needed  a new phone cuz iphone locked w/ verizon. Save your money and buy a better phone, despite being new, not enough features to make it work correctly. Its basically a phone, internet is almost non existent, does play you tube videos good. but thats a built in feature.Searching  for a business or the use of GPS does not work"	0
"Bought this new.  Tracfone said sim was deactivated. Need new sim. Sent me one no 3X minutes,. Who deactivated it Tracfone? Tracfone did so they don't have to give 3X minutes, .False advertising"	0

"bought this phone as a gift for my sister, im no android fan but this phone was decent enough for the price, great mid level phone"	1
Bought this phone as a replacement phone to the model I&apos;m already using. Our local phone carrier already doesn&apos;t offer this EX112 anymore. Easy to use for me being a feature phone rather than a smart phone I don&apos;t have to pay extra. Fits my needs perfectly.	1

Bought this phone because I owned one that broke. I needed a replacement. This one came as described and works exactly as it should. Battery life was in excellent condition.	1
"Bought this phone because I trust durability and beauty of Apple iphones.  But to my disappointment with this phone when you take photos using flash you get blueish image!So you I can not depend on it at night. It might be a refurbished phone or something. Phone was also not delivered on time I think though the seller claimed the product to be shipped from US, it was coming from other country so I had to wait more than a week!"	0
"Bought this phone because it claims to withstand some falls, water, and such. Phone lasted about 3 months before fully dying. Bought expensive case for extra protection too. Dropped phone onto hard floor from 3ft and the screen cracked in 4 places (with case/screen protector), then last night dropped phone in a puddle and it completely died. Don't waste your money on this phone; even though this seller sells it for less; it is still not worth it. Phone will not stand up to what it is supposed to do."	0
Bought this phone because my old phone was giving me a lot of problems. BUT this phone was worse!!! I will never buy a cell phone on ebay again. All I did was buy somebody elses problem!	0
Bought this phone doesnt work with Verizon asked for return address and was ignored!  Will never buy from again. 	0
"Bought this phone expecting a phone in excellent condition as it states in their description. The phone is NOT that at all. The one they sent is very worn and heavily scratched. I think it's in worse condition than my 4 yr old iphone! Perhaps I don't understand what refurbished means but I didn't expect this. Headphone jack is faulty, screen suddenly decides not work when it wants... "	0

Bought this phone for a friend of mine who is not into Smartphones. Years ago I had a couple 6350's and was very happy with them.	1

"Bought this phone for my 16-year-old's birthday. He's had it 3 months now. No glitches or gimmicks - we got exactly what was advertised. The phone is in excellent condition, and he loves it. This is a great way to save money buying a couple of generations back from the newest version. Perfect for a teenager. The wider, rounded screen suits him, because he likes to play games and watch videos on his phone. We are super-safisfied with this purchase!"	1
Bought this phone for my daughter and after a month it stopped working. Took it to my carrier and they checked it and found out that the screen had already been replaced on the phone before and that the phone was no good no matter if I changed the battery according to the store. I ended up having to spend another $600 to get a new one. Wish I had known before I bought it as it would have saved me a heck of a lot of money. Lesson learned. 	0
"Bought this phone for my daughter for Christmas, but phone never showed up.  This seller posted something that he never had.  On the positive note was refunded my money promptly but was very dissapointed that I waited two weeks before receiving word that the phone was not coming."	0

Bought this phone for my father who is elderly and needs a simple easy to use phone. Set up the speed dials for him so all he has to do to reach me is dial one number.	1
"Bought this phone for my husband, he isn't a huge apps/games person so a more basic phone like this is a great value for him.   Phone worked wonderfully for about 10 days, suddenly not anymore. The phone gets stuck on the opening song/jingle and repeats It nonstop, never fully loading. We tried looking around for information on how to do a hard reset on this phone, due to this phone/manufacturer being relatively unknown we had difficulty. Finally, we were able to get the screen open for the hard reset (you hold the power button and the top volume button, in case anyone needs to know). Although we did the reset this same problem mentioned before persists so now we have a $70  piece of junk that does nothing but stick on the beginning loading screen.  If you hold the power button and the low volume button it opens a different menu but its in Chinese, so good luck there. Had a Chinese friend try to help me with that menu as well but the problem still has not changed.  Before these issues my husband liked the phone a lot, it had a decent battery life and worked great for his limited digital needs.  Now its junk.  I suggest saving your money and buying a more known brand or better quality in general."	0
Bought this phone for my husband. He is not a smart phone man. This phone is light weight and has the features of the new and old. The screen in bigger than most flips. The key pad is larger than most also and he loves that. Very easy to use. I have no complaints about this phone. Very nice.	1
Bought this phone for my moms friend. She is enjoying it very much and very please with its condition. Thank You!	1

"BOUGHT THIS PHONE FOR THE BABYSITTER.  SUITS HER NEEDS PERFECTLY, ALSO, YOU NEVER LOOSE MINUTES BECAUSE THEY LAST FOR 3 MONTHS, NOT LIKE SOME OTHER PAY AS YOU GO PLANS.  ENCLUDED COUPONS FOR FREE BONUS MINUTES AND BUY A MINUTE PACK GET DOUBLE.  WHO WOULDN&apos;T LOVE THAT?"	1
"Bought this phone for the camera and am disappointed. The optical zoom is nice but rarely useful for me at least. Need an optical zoom, I recommend buying a digital camera. The xenon flash is very weak and only useful at very close range, but it will help drain the battery with the phones poor talk time. Only takes good pics outside in perfect lighting, and indoors in really ideal lighting. Pics in bright light get washed out. Colors and contrast not nearly as good as Samsungs G600. The G800 does have a better video camera than the G600. The G800 5MP camera also has fewer pixels than the G600 (unfortunately read specs and other reviews and saw comparison tests online after purchase). The G800 standby time is good, but talk time is very short. G800 has only one keypad tone which is piano key tones. Overall disappointed and sorry I purchased this thick phone/camera. The G600 has a weak LED flash but not much worse than the poor xenon flash on The G800.  In my opinion don&apos;t spend your money on this camera, buy The G600 for nearly half the price.   Watch Ebay sellers though, and read the fine print. Some sellers are selling G600 phones made by Pantech which are dual band. Verify that it is a Samsung Quad Band and not the Pantech Dual Band!! Wish I had not purchased this Phone/Camera!!!"	0
"Bought this phone from this ebay seller 1.5 years ago, and the GPS completely crapped out at the 1 year mark. And I've tried everything to fix it - rebooting the phone, downloading all those GPS fine-tuning apps, calibrators, etc etc, removing the phone case, what have you. Nothing.  It seems like a hardware issue that was shoddily patched. I have friends who purchased S5's brand new from a legit retailer (ie - not this seller), and their phones are still going strong years and years later. I've always kept my phone in a protective case and taken extremely good care of it. After reading other reviews suspecting this seller of misrepresenting refurbished phones as ""new,"" it all makes sense. Pissed.   If you buy from this seller, there's a chance your phone will be fine for the first few months or even years, but expect it to completely fall apart after that. "	0
"Bought this phone from this seller and paid a little extra because of the stuffs in the bundle. Phone looks okay but the VR viewer came in broken. Sent an email to the seller but he wouldn't respond. At the end of the day, I paid more for this bundle when I could have purchased only the phone elsewhere for a much lesser price during Black Friday."	0
"Bought this phone going out of the country, after 1 day of use it turned off and it wouldnt charge or turn back on again. I get back in the country about a month later and its past the sellers return window and they denied my request. DO NOT BUY FROM THEM! CRAP PRODUCTS. "	0
"Bought this phone in condition good. Took it to Verizon, paid a non-refundable $70 activation fee to have the phone turn out to be incapable of detecting a SIM card and it says it has moisture in it. Very disappointed."	0
"Bought this phone in good faith for one of my young children as a starter phone, my daughter was very excited about the prospect of her first mobile telephone.I paid for the item by sending a cheque and waited.......some time later I received an e mail requesting my address, I replied with said details and then waited some more.Some time later I contacted the seller.....no reply.I contacted the seller again when my cheque for the item had been cashed....no reply. The seller then cancelled his e bay registration and is probably spending my money on topping up my mobile phone.    Amazon.co.uk....you are my new best friend."	0
Bought this phone on Ebay for a very good price. I really like the gray color on the back. This is the best phone I have ever owned. The battery holds up very well. Also I can use this phone as anywhere in my house and not drop any calls like previous phones I have owned. No complaints on this phone. 	1
"Bought this phone on Ebay was suppose to be &quot;new&quot; when I got the phone it had someone&apos;s text messages and phone numbers. Contacted seller about the misrepresentation and got a partial refund. The external screen doesn&apos;t work and none of the electric chargers work.  Other than this, the phone is great. This is the second V8 that I&apos;ve had that wouldn&apos;t charge with electric charger."	0

"Bought this phone to replace a broken phone until I qualify for a free one. It worked for about a week, just long enough to clear the 7 day warranty. I&apos;ll never buy anything from ebay again! The deals are never as good as they seem. At least products from Amazon work. Stop bidding and just buy it. I have not won an auction yet. I think they&apos;re fixed. How &apos;s that for a review. You asked for it, you got it! I&apos;ll be surprised if you even post it."	0
Bought this phone to replace a stolen one and was surprised to have found a used one in such good condition. Seller got the phone to me in 3 days. 	1
"Bought this phone to replace an old one that was very similar. Pretty simple to use, but ended up returning it because the battery life was horrible. I had made only two 10 min calls and 4 texts and I was already down to one bar starting the day with full bars. Also the volume on this was bad. I found it very hard to hear my incoming calls compared to my old LG GU295."	0
Bought this phone to replace one I purchase from T-mobile. Thought it was new in the box the headphone enhancement was not included. You need this to listen to the FM radio. It was included with the phone I purchased from T-mobile. The cover over the headphone connection was damaged.	0

Bought this phone to use on cricket service....   This phone is so old that it can't be used on any company anymore per the cricket customer service  Don't waste your money	0
"Bought this phone with the intention of activating on my Verizon account.  Even though I already have a Lumia 735 that I am using, Verizon says the 950 XL is not compatible.  Not really the phone's fault, I find fault with Verizon and I have service with Verizon and it's previous companies, i.e. Alltel, Contel, etc. for 27 years. BUYERS, MAKE SURE ANY WINDOWS PHONE YOU BUY IS COMPATIBLE WITH YOUR CELL PROVIDER....I LOVE THE PHONE BUT WHAT GOOD IS IT IF I CANNOT USE IT."	0
"bought this phone, it arrived on 9-12-2011. Activated it the same day.  Love the feel and features of the phone.  On 9-16-2011, three and half days later, the phone was dead. The screen was dark, it would not power up. I returned it on 9-17-2011 to the seller."	0

Bought this simply because I wanted to upgrade and I&apos;ve been in love ever since. Great battery life and the features are really easy to use!	1
"Bought this through an auction. I have always been the new-iPhone-right away person until a few years back. I have stuck with my 6s for awhile, and after Apples keynote last week I was ready to get a new phone.  I use a lot of storage, so a 64 gig was out of the question, and after seeing the prices for the new 256g AND reading an article online listing all the benefits of the 8 vs MS (price, weigh), I figured let me give it a try - worst case I was  positive I could sell it myself and get the new MS.  I am glad I did. Great phone, nice size (my first Plus), but most importantly great seller.  Phone arrived 4 days before due date, and is in better shape than described. Seller said it was in great shape with some very minor scratches visible only under light on the screen. Well at the price I won the auction at, I was willing to risk it. To my surprise the phone is in PERFECT shape. The blemishes are so negligible you actually have to sit there and actively look for them.  Thank you so much. A good experience makes everything better. A++ "	1
Bought this to replace 6915 which stopped syncing - a common problem with that model. This one is almost identical and everything works the way it&apos;s supposed to - and it syncs! YAY!	1
"Bought this to replace my dated and stolen! htc one x. Very pleased with my purchase. Ideal smartphone to pickup if you want lots of features, customization, and power. The best part is there is no bloatware comes with the basics plus a couple useful Google apps. replace the ones that suck (hangouts and the stock launcher) and you have an awesome phone! No better bang for you buck out there right now!"	1
"Bought this to replace my daughter's iPhone.  We are on a different network than Sprint.  I thought it would be like a Verizon or AT&T phone and just call in to get unlocked.  NOPE!  It has to 1) have the original user be known AND 2) be on Sprint with a know user for 50 days.  That means even if you activate it on a Sprint line it has to be there for 50 days.  That will cost $130 to get unlocked ($30 activation fee and 2 months at $50 each.) Not including taxes.  You can use a service to unlock, but it is still a total of $130.  Sprint STINKS!!!!!!!!!"	0
"Bought this to replace my old Ericsson, had no trouble with it until the keyboard starting acting up."	1
"Bought this to replace my original 4011 which I used for over 5 years (until I stepped on it). Simple, straight-forward PHONE! No bells,no whistles, which is EXACTLY what I need and want. Durable, serviceable and most of all SIMPLE!"	1
"bought this to upgrade from a razor,i like the size and convenience of use,this product is comparably very favorable and above average."	1
"Bought this to use with Straight Talk. Transferred service from another Straight Talk phone. The phone service transferred but not the 4G LTE service. Phone would only connect to Internet via Wi-Fi. Went though  numerous steps to try to connect with LTE service including rebooting/resetting the software but to no avail.  Discovered that some screens on the phone are not the same as a stock s5. Some widgets are missing as well such as the Mobile Data widget. This is either a software-defective phone or a knockoff/fake. In either case, the phone is useless and is being returned. "	0
Bought this unit for the Hydro feature and luckily I never had to test it (water resistance). Served me well for over 2 years so I purchased this one as a replacement and couldn&apos;t be more happy.	1
"Bought this used for my tween because she&apos;s begged for one for a couple of years now. It&apos;s her first phone, but she finds it easy to use and loves it. She accidentally locked it up (too many wrong passcode tries) and we had to contact Apple. Service Tech called 2 seconds after I filled out contact info. online.  AMAZING support for an old, out-of-warranty product. Apple has new fans. Just please don&apos;t call us &quot;Apple Fanboys&quot; because my son and I have picked on them for years =)"	1
"Bought this used to replace one with a cracked screen. Unfortunately the battery was weak n doesn't hold a charge for long. But the old phones battery is still holding a charge all day long. So as the used phone goes it works brilliantly, the battery wasn't in good condition maybe poor ( well used ). Fortunately swapped batteries so good to go."	1
Bought three phones from seller and he put 2 phones in shipment declaring that all three were delivered. Called eBay to make sure that this crook wont get paid for the third phone . You should be ashamed of yourself 	0
"Bought to replace an identical phone. Phone will not work on the internet, one of the main features of this phone. Seller stated &quot;fine print&quot; internet not guaranteed when I called them. Cannot re-program to phone to work. Wast of $$$. Better to buy a track phone from Wal-Mart!"	0
bought to use with cingular area.  doesnot support the frequency any more.  cingular upgrades made this phone useless.  sits on my shelf only as t- mobile cannot use it even. make sure your area supports it and cingular is not going to do away with this frequency soon in your area.  nikia is a good clear cell phone but this model is obsolite.	0
"Bought two of these just before Christmas 2016. My husband and I have had so many problems with these we are looking for new phones. It seems sometimes these things are possessed. It will switch to airplane mode by itself. Will go mute during a call, or speaker with no warning. They'll make calls by themselves and you can't hang up! Had to shut it off. Calls numbers I haven't dialed. Bluetooth turns on by itself. Sometimes will go from fully charged to dead in 12 hrs, while not being used.  If it was only one of the phones with these problems I could pass it off as a lemon. But it's both, with the same problems. Last time I ever buy a phone so soon after release."	0

Box had been opened. The original User Manuel from Nokia had been removed and replaced with a simple manuel that basically gave instructions on how to install the battery and turn the phone on. I have no way to know how to get the full use of my phone let alone all the options I have. I had ordered the same phone previously for my wife with no problem. This is why I know the manual is not the correct one. Phone was advertized as new never opened. Very disappointed with this sale.	0

"Brilliant phone. Beats the iphone hands down in my personal opinion. 4.3 &quot; screen is a dream and touch screen is super fast and very responsive. Is unlocked so can use it with any SIM in the future too. No hassles. HTC sense is simply superb and lays very well over WinMobile. My partner has a HTC hero and and we both are in love with the HTC sense. Battery is replaceable unlike iphone. Micro SD card can be upgraded unlike iphone, FM radio built in (sorry iphone users !). Very happy to have waited a got this. To summarize, it has Everything and more you could ever ask for from a smart phone. Highly recommended. This is THE iphone killer, in my opinion !!"	1

"Buen telefono, excelente pantalla con buena resoluci�n, la c�mara saca buenas fotos pero es algo lenta y de noche es peor, las teclas son algo duras talvez por ser a prueba de salpicaduras, el exterior se deteriora r�pidamente el color del que compre es speed black y la parte gris sobre la pantalla se esta decolorando y solo en un mes de uso y bien cuidado, soy usuario de Sony ericsson desde hace 6 a�os tuve un W810i y era mas duradero que este modelo que se siente mas comercial y menos refinado. Si se trata de enviar sms o jugar con el puede ser un dolor de dedos por las teclas que son bien r�gidas. Espero Sony mejore estos aspectos para satisfacer a todos sus usuarios. Por los $ 279 que pague por el C-702 recomiendo mejor el K-850i de 5 megapixeles en la c�mara"	0

Bueno bonito barato gracias	1
Bueno puede decirle que al comprar este dispositivo no llen� mis expectativas porque el vendedor proporcion� una informaci�n enga�osa del producto no tiene responsabilidad es un estafador y no le recomiendo a ning�n usuaria hacerle ninguna compra. Asimismo no cumpli� con la fecha establecida de la entrega del dispositivo y lo entreg� cuando le dio su regalada gana es muy irresponsable en las ventas que realiza por esta via. Tambi�n cuando me comunicaba con el vendedor nunca ten�a una respuesta cre�ble porque al parecer no hab�a puesta el env�o del dispositivo tal y como fue comprado. En resumen tomen mucha cuenta al hacer una compra sobre todo a este vendedor no es confiable.	0

Buttons are broken including the enter button how tf am i supposed to text man thats why i bought it. Waiste of money now i gotta buy another. Items wasnt as described wasted 70 bucks.	0
Buttons are too little for my and fingers. I still have not figured out how to get my text messages. I&apos;m not great with these types of things....but I have never had this much difficulty figuring one out before.	0
"buttons werent  working , didnt store some text."	0
Buttons you can see!  Buttons large enough that your finger only hits one at a time!  Menus that don't get in the way until you need them.  A ringer that you can hear and that sounds like a telephone not a passing circus. An effective way to control butt-dialing. By far the best man human factors design I have seen in a cell phone. Unneeded features are largely eliminated. Almost good enough to double as a 1950s phone from Maq Bell!  A phone for the elder end of the generation gap!	1

"---------------------------------BUYER BEWARE -------------------- -------------    I got this phone for my birthday from my boyfriend last March. I have not even had the phone a year yet and I have major issues with it. Two months after I got the phone it started locking up, I would have to take the battery out and put it back and restart the phone. Then about 3 months ago my phone started with a new problem - incoming calls would not register, I would check my phone and it would say I had a voicemail but no missed calls. I can not upgrade my software properly and two weeks ago I started having problem with callers not being able to hear me.     All of these problems are typical of HTC phones. It usually take a year before the phone starts freezing and the microphone goes out but in some case (such as mine) it happens in 8 months. BUYER BEWARE once you have had the phone for 6 months HTC will not fix it. A repair ship tried to charge me $100 to fix the microphone alone."	0

It usually take a year before the phone starts freezing and the microphone goes out but in some case (such as mine) it happens in 8 months. BUYER BEWARE once you have had the phone for 6 months HTC will not fix it. A repair ship tried to charge me $100 to fix the microphone alone."	0
"BUYER BEWARE OF SELLER  Listing for FEDEX super saver shipping with confirned 3-5 business day delivery.  Seller printed shipping label for USPS to register/process transaction however never delivered it to the post office.  Two weeks later, no product, still no delivery to the post office despite Seller's response that the post office lost the package.  After research, no US Seller, no package.  Canceled sale immediately after shannanigans but kept track anyway as it still reflects on my ebay history as canceling a transaction.  Similar to the nightmare of having my account hacked by French ebayers and being left with a false transaction history.  Another story, another time.   "	0

"Buyer beware! There is a known microphone issue with this phone. Mine was bad out here of the box, but most fail 3-6-12 months after purchasing. The microphone only fails to work when making a standard call. Speakerphone calls work perfectly. The sad thing is that it took me a week to realize the issue because I make most calls using the speakerphone. I thought the couple of calls that could not hear me were caller related and not me...nope it was my fault.  I will recommend this phone as a GREAT 6 tablet. "	0
"BUYER BEWARE!!  Notice to all future buyers of the Nokia 6236i.  It is a cheap phone.  I purchased it on E-Bay &amp; have only had it a couple weeks before it quit charging.  The connection went bad.  It&apos;s already broken!  I&apos;m assuming it&apos;s the Nokia product.  Trust me, that you should research all products prior to purchase and it at all possible?  BUY NEW IN THE PACKAGING."	0
Buyer beware!!! This seller is a fraud. Item was shipped and no tracking provided. Tracking later provided but item was shipped to himself. Item was never received. Asked for money back.	0
"Buyer Beware.  This has been the most inadequate, frustrating phone I have ever used.  I bought 2 phones, new, and one came with a dead battery (AT&amp;T phones).  When put into use, it had the same, aggravating faults.  The model has very poor range, mostly not picking up calls, or just dropping them.  The programs are far from user friendly, typically not completing tasks, or requiring 2 or 3 attempts. It is amazing that  Samsung would allow such a poor model to stay on the market."	0
Buyer beware. This items is illegal to sell and ship in the USA	0
"Buyer beware. Yes, it does have an Android operating system. No, you can not download any apps. Email is locked to the local carrier. Not a great option for use in North America. It was unlocked and had to translate the Japanese to change the menus to English. About 30% remains in Japanese even with language set to English. Seller was amazing and phone was otherwise exactly as described. Just very overpriced for what amounts to (in North America) a very basic flip phone."	0
"BUYER BEWARE....very disappointed in the product I received.  I was not informed that the phone WILL NOT have Touch ID, which means I cannot utilize The Wallet.  My interactions with the seller was a poor showing.  Basically blown off and told it does not have Touch ID.  Would love to get my money back, but not convinced of the process of refunds.  Plus, the phone is a little slow."	0
"BUYER BEWARE:  SELLER DOES NOT ACCEPT RETURNS I loved my GS III, a few years ago, but dropped it in a can of paint, ruining is charging port, so decided to buy one on E Bay.  It was brand new, in a box that had never been opened, so I thought it would be a great deal. However, it updates at least 3 times a day, via the ""Essentials"" program, and wipes out the wallpaper I keep downloading, and also puts all the widgets that I didn't want back onto my home screen, and deletes the widgets that I had personally placed on the home screen.  After 5 days, the screen froze, making it impossible to reach the home screen at all.  I think the GS III has become  dinosaur.  If you buy a new GS III, it's too far behind the curve to properly receive all of the updates that happened since the time GS III was originally put on the market.  I'm not a techie, but I know enough to tell you that the phone stopped working, completely.  When you can't get to the home screen, the phone is useless.    That was a waste of $100, plus $15 shipping.  I also ordered 4 cases for it, from China, that I wil now have to return.  THIS SELLER DOES NOT ACCEPT RETURNS.   "	0
Buyer cancelled the purchase after I won and paid!	0
Buyer did not disclose that there was no antenae.  A screw was in the place of the antenae.  Verizon was very nice and let me purchase one at a low cost.  The phone was cheap but I believe buyer should have disclosed everything.	0

"Buying a 3GS in 2019 is about as useless as spending money on a lotto ticket. The chances of this being a useful device is almost at .000001 percent. The device OS is no longer updatable, the hardware malfunctioning, and the battery completely depleted. Even modularly repairing this is a waste of anyones time. The only reason to purchase this is to enjoy the nostalgia factor of browsing through the ancient OS or merely for gimmicks.  Regardless, I bought the phone as a joke to a friend for Christmas, and unfortunately the device sent to me had a swelling battery. I fully expected this phone not to work properly, I also expected it to be in bad condition. What I DIDNT expect is the seller sent it with a swelling battery, lifting display and excessively bulging rear and did not label the package with a lithium contents label... This was practically a mini bomb."	0
"Buying this phone was the worst mistake I have ever made.. The seller described the phone wrong, it arrived damaged, then after trying to return the phone 3 times because the seller purposely returned it 2 times, we are now out $75 for shipping costs for a phone we didnt really want.. and now the seller is trying to make me feel bad about returning the phone.."	0
By all indications this handset has an unusual programming limitation such that it only negotiates a maximum of a 75mpbs connection with any Wifi signal it encounters.  I spent an hour with Asus phone support today who setup an RMA yet it's doubtful to remedy the problem given a long thread over on Amazon's reviews page about this problem.  As for the ZE551KL handset I received today.  It has the latest firmware and latest Android updates.  The handset will only connect at 72mbps no what router I connect to.��All of my other handsets even my really cheap $40 handsets connect at either 150mbps or 300mbps.  I understand what a 75mbps connection infers...that the device is connecting with 1 antenna @ 20mhz width while a 150mbps connection infers a device is connecting with 1 antenna @ 40mhz channel width.��300mbps is 2 antennas @ 40mhz channel width.  I'm convinced this is a firmware problem and not a chip problem given Asus L1 & L2 phone support affirms this handset has only 1 antenna.��They just setup an RMA.��I doubt it will fix the problem given the commentary here.  Asus doesn't offer cross shipping if I provide them my credit card so they tell me I'd be without a phone for 3-4 weeks...and I doubt it will fix the problem.	0

This was a phone for the wife and very unhappy with it.  Thank goodness I used pay pal to pay and they have a 180 days instead of 30 days that Ebay has, Pay Pal refunded me the entire amount and the phone ended up in the garbage,  Make sure you buy a phone that has American service department.

"Cant say if my review counts as I bought it used. Dislikes are when on speaker phone you cannot interrupt the party that is talking as they cannot hear you. To use voice dial you have to open the phone, (my Motorola Quantico had a external button on the side). When using speaker phone it has to be a good distance away otherwise people cant understand you. In my opinion it is not a good phone but as I said I got it used and maby its a junker."	0

Case closed... eBay refunded my purchase money.... after I opened a case and then escalated it. This seller is a fraud. We won a bid and paid immediately (thank God we used PayPal). Never received our purchased item. Seller never communicated with us... until after the money was refunded. Our money was tied up from January 28 until February 18.   Thank you eBay for your integrity and good customer service. Too bad this seller does not have these qualities.  Future Bidders: beware of sellers like this one. Chances are this seller will move to open a different eBay account and start over with fresh ratings. Be careful out there.	0

Changed from Palm Pre as I was having major issues with constant need to restart and sucky battery life. I have had no regrets buying my hero. I anticipated a poor battery life so I spent an extra $70 for the extended battery from Seidio which triple my battery life (usage time). I love it- likely you will love it too. Awaiting upgrade to Android 2.o Platform which I&apos;m told by HTC is coming soon. IPhone has strong competition.	1

Charge it at might with it off and after about an hour of turning on but not used the battery is about 68%. Hopefully it is just a bad battery. I ordered a new battery. Also another issue is that it doesn&apos;t recognize the extra memory with applications going right to the internal memory.	0

"Clean device, screen time eats battery quite fast but decent otherwise"	1
"Clean IMEI? Yes, It took me go thru initialization/setup procedures as documented in vendor site.    No, this is not an unlocked phone.  I should insert my SIM as I received it. But I just check everything, and spent a week to downloaded maps and tailor every apps I have with my old Nokia.  When I insert my SIM, it displayed &quot;LOCKED&quot; and another message prompted me that I have ten times to enter unlock code. Too bad, I&apos;ve already given positive feedback to this seller.    I know how to unlock it, but this is a matter of trust.  How can I buy again from this seller if I cannot trust what I read?"	0
"Clear and bright screen, easy to use, nice construction, great features, customizable, built in stylus, Micro SD slot up to 8Gb, touch screen but much more compact than an iPhone or other touch screen models--so it&apos;s great for my trips overseas! This is the perfect travel phone!"	1
"Clear Bright 5"" Dispaly, Great OS (Windows Phone 8.1) Only concern . Will it get a Windows 10 update?"	1
"Clearly not the original phone so trying to resolve the problems has been difficult.The buttons constantly lock, or worse just will not work, no matter how hard or how many times you hit the same button. Restarting it does nothing. Battery life is less then 24 hours. The phone is set to English but a number of things are either in Spanish or French. Was hoping for a durable simple oldschool phone (the one I had in my highschool years) but this has been more of a hassle and waste of money. went back to using my other phone."	0

"Coming from a galaxy s5, it's a relatively small step up. Pros,  big beautiful bright hi deff screen. Very fast, has Android 6.0, very large battery, prices are very good for such a new high end phone. Cons,  even though it has a third larger battery, it can use it up very fast. Low use it will easily last a day. High use, it will start getting low by mid day. Other,  It feels thin and small for such a big screen, and the screen glass seems to not show finger prints. All in all, very pleased with it."	1
"Coming from a Pixel 2 XL I was worried about the camera, but found that it performs just as well once you load the Gcam apk and the stock cam works great too. I miss a couple things like always on display and call screening but the rest of the phone feels like an upgrade. The screen is great, colors are accurate and can be adjusted to your liking. Overall it is like a Pixel with a few more customization options and looks about 10 time better in my opinion. The battery also lasts considerable longer. Just get one."	1
"Coming from a Samsung Intercept on virgin mobile this phone is amazing.  The colors look very crisp and clear, the camera takes great pictures and the screen actually appears to be a tiny bit bigger than a 3.2 compared to other 3.2 screens I&apos;ve saw (samsung intercept).  The battery life is great I manage to get through a whole day using it as a mp3 player, texting, web use, and calling and still have a half a battery at the end of the day.  However, I do miss having a keyboard but after using the phone for a good week I&apos;m much faster with swype than with my physical keyboard on the Samsung Intercept."	1
Coming from an HTC Droid Eris this is a MUCH better phone. A lot more snappy and more apps not only work with it but they work much better. Very happy with this phone. My next phone will probably be the Thunderbolt depending on the reviews.	1
"Coming from the Galaxy Nexus I was wondering how much better the S3 was going to be. I was pretty impressed overall with the size or should I say the slimness of this phone as well as the larger screen.  I am not bashing apples iphone but the entire iphone fits in the screen of my S3.  I opted to install an otterbox defender series as I have a bad reputation for dropping phones, as I am sure most of us do, it added to its size but is worth it as I already dropped the phone with the case and there was no damage.  As far as the phone goes its awesome, overall the same feel as my nexus with a little more speed and smoothness.  Battery life is awesome compared to my nexus which I had to carry around two batteries just to get through a full days use.  One feature I think sets the S3 apart is the ability to capture photos while shooting video, I cant say enough about that option.  Camera is also awesome and takes pictures as good as my samsung digital cam.  Buy the phone you wont regret it."	1
CommentsThis was supposed to be a Virgin Mobile CUSTOM phone but it s not. The service for this phone is by some OLD company called ZACT. I had to do research and find out about them online. They went out of business in 2014 and the phone CAN T BE ACTIVATED! I need a refund for this phone and paid shipping to send it back.	0

Communication was not great.  Didn&apos;t put any care into shipping the phone. It was placed with the charger in a large box and moved around and scratch the phone during shipping.  The back has mass scratches... at least it turned on... I honestly thought when I opened it up I got punked and it wouldn&apos;t work.  Description was very misleading.   Description said it was mint condition.. not even close.. will never buy again.	0

I like how the internet can be accessed and this phone has many applications that would satisfy anyones needs for a compact smartphone. it might not be an Iphone or blackberry, but it fulfills the requirments of a good phone.     would i recommend it...absolutely."	1
"Compact, light, powerful, great software and simple design. Only downside is battery life but considering it isn;t that hard to change and with the price, you can't go wrong. One of my top 3 smartphones of all time, greatly recommend."	1

Company canceled order.	0
Company sold a phone that was useless it was Factory lock protected which means in order to use it I had to find someone to try and unlock the phone the company wouldn't write their wrongs they wouldn't replace the phone or even give me a discount	0
"Compare the specs to other phones and you will see what a value this is in processor speed, storage capacity, picture quality, etc. I won't say the battery life is ""Excellent"", but I don't think they are in general.  I would say it's good as far as cell phones go. But, the great thing with this phone is if you every wish to do so, you can replace the battery yourself.    My husband and I each have this phone.  I broke one, and replaced it with an exact replica - that says a lot, I think.  Thanks for asking. "	1

"Completely dissatisfied.  Phone has no WiFi calling,  which I depend on when home, as I live in a rural area,  which renders the phone completely useless for me. Takes forever to charge and the battery goes quick. "	0

"COPY OF THE EMAIL I SENT THE SELLER. IN THE END I HAD TO SPEND MORE MONEY BECAUSE I WAS DECEIVED!!!  Hello, I received the HTC phone that I purchased from you, thanks for the fast shipping, however, I think you may have sent me the wrong device. In the listing you stated that the hangup button on the phone is broken, but otherwise the phone works great. The device you sent me will power on and seems that the hangup button works but the touchscreen does not. I cannot use the phone at all, which is a great inconvenience to me."	0
correct copying quiet fast	1
Correct if I m wrong if I dont know anything about boost mobile than a my fault but seller should have no problem answering my questions the seller should tell you if the phone has anyone or not and is the phone prepaid and if the phone is not prepaid it's not prepaid even it says it plus I found some other seller who sells this phone for 50 bucks and has free shipping and a 3 year warranty and answer all my questions dont from this seller this seller was rude and even than if its black Friday if I was seller  wouldn't you guys drop your prices to even if it's just a few dollars off & dont answer cause I know you guys would cause if you think about If I was lowering my phone just a few dollars off for just random people in general for you guys wouldn't you  I m not saying your gonna  but think about it for second they raise price on me  but I lower price for them any who dont from this seller really rude it's up to you guys just being honest and telling it like how it is	0

"Costing half as much as the Pixel and Pixel 2, the Nexus 5x does everything well in working as a Project Fi phone.  So sorry that they've discontinued it as a Google offering, for I prefer its smaller size and weight to the others.  I've read about an inadequate battery life, but have not found it son, in getting a full day's use, (yes, lighter usage than most people might do,) from a single hour and a half to two hour charge.  In all, it's been great."	1
"Could be a good device if you add a case to it before first use.  However, my list of cons outweigh the pros; if I had known these things beforehand, I would not have purchased the phone.   Pros: * Dual screen is a nice feature that can come in handy (i.e. calculator on one screen and list of numbers on the other)  * high powered camera  * snappy performance  * superb audio out with headphones  * has SD card  * fast charging  Cons * Both sides of the device are slippery - increases odds of device falling from surfaces (i.e., windowsills, tables, etc.) - increases odds of device falling out of hands - fragile screen (already has light cracks after small drop on wood floor)  * Back screen prone to heavy scratching without case; this phone is barely a few weeks old and looks to be about 2 years older (my year old S8+ was abused out of the case and does not have nearly as many heavy scratching and bruising as the Axon M in the few weeks I've had it)  * Awkward camera (must turn device over to use back camera and can get caught in a loop where user keeps turning the phone from screen to screen to try to exit the camera app with limited success)  * awkward flashlight; flashlight is very cumbersome to use and can only be accessed within settings  * very thick device  * the TV mode butto"	0

Durch seine Gr��e   findet es auch in kleinen Taschen (Hemd oder Weste) seinen Platz.Insgesamt mach die Verarbeitung einen   sehr guten und stabilen Eindruck und die Lesbarkeit und Helligkeit des   Displays ist so gut wie man das von Nokia erwartet. Die installierten Spiele   treffen so ganz meinen Geschmack zeigen aber was in den Ger�t steckt.   Das mitgelieferte Headset ist hat einen satten Klang und eine sehr gute   Sprachqualit�t. Die eingebaute Kamera macht ordentliche Bilder und l�sst   sich wackelfrei ausl�sen.   Fazit: Das Nokia 6230 ist ein solides praktisches Ger�t und kein   Fun-Phone wer es in erster Linie zum telefonieren und f�r Datendienste   ben�tigt ist damit sehr gut bedient.Nun zu den Tasten, sie sind gut angeordnet und man ist beim SMS schreiben flott unterwegs. Auch Videos k�nnen mit dem Nokia 6230 aufgenommen , direkt abgespielt oder sogar als MMS verschickt werden. Sehr positiv meiner Ansicht ist die Speicherverwaltung"	1

"Das Handa wurde nicht korrekt angeboten. Ich war der Meinung,  (Sprint) geh�rt zur Artikelbezeichnung. In Wirklichkeit handelt es sich um ein Handy welches Simlock auf den US Anbieter Sprint  hat und somit in Europa gar nicht nutzbar ist. Ich kann nur jedem raten, sich  k e i n  iPhone is USA zu kaufen. Dass das  Handy ein Simlock hat, wurde vom Anbieter nicht verschwiegen!  Ich f�hle mich �ber den Tisch gezogen"	0
"Das Handy gef�llt mir durch die Form,hatte schon ein gleiches Handy fiel allerdings beim angeln ins Wasser,ich w�rde mich wieder f�r dieses Handy entscheiden,ist sch�n,und Funktionell.Bisher mein bestes Handy."	1
Das Handy habe ich im besten Zustand erhalten.Top EBAYer! Gerne wieder.Das Angebot seitens des Verk�ufers war sehr gut und detailiert beschrieben.Die Lieferung war prompt.	1
Das Handy hat ein sehr ansprechendes Design. Zus�tzlich ist es kompatibel zur Freisprecheinrichtung HKW-720.     Die Bedienung ist sehr einfach (wie von Siemens gewohnt). Durch den Mechanismus zum �ffnen und Schlie�en ideal f�r die Damenhandtasche. Meine Frau ist jedenfalls begeistert ;-)	1
Das Handy ist spitze in der Handhabung. Hat eine Super Super Akkuleistung.Gegens�tze kann ich im Moment nicht sagen. Bis jetzt habe ich noch keine bemerkt.	1
"Das handy ist super f�r leute die nicht viel schnick schnack am telefon brauchen....ich habe es als arbeitstelefon und ich bin damit total zufrieden,lange akkulaufzeit und viel speicherplatz....die zugaben wie spiele und radio finde ich klasse....also jeden zu empfehlen!!!!:0)"	1
"das Handy ist vom Preis/Leistungsverh�ltnis einmalig, Verarbeitung sieht sehr edel aus, nicht biegsam (Metallchassis), Silikonh�lle im Lieferumfang, alle Apps arbeiten bei mir sehr schnell.. Habe das Handy seit 1 Woche, bisher nur ein Nachteil gefunden; Klingellautst�rke f�r Anrufe und Benachrichtigungen lassen sich nicht getrennt einstellen. Ich suche aber weiter, vielleicht finde ich doch noch eine M�glichkeit, kann ansonsten damit leben."	1
"Das Handy war leider kein Origial als ich es bekam. Es gibt bei Ebay Auktionen CECT Telefone die genau so aussehen wie Nokia da steht auch Nokia drauf! Ich habe es leider nachtr�glich festgestellt. Wenn Ihr ein Handy ersteigert Pr�ft die IMEI Nummer egal welches Model es ist, das hei�t aber nicht das es dann auch ein Original ist auch da nehmen die Kopierer Handys mit einer Originalnummer versehen ist. Ich warte Heute nach 6 Wochen obwohl es mit Paypal geschlossen wurde auf die Auszahlung. Passiert ist bis Heute noch nichts. Alle anforderungen die Paypal haben m�chte sind zum Teil nicht gerechtfertigt wie ein Nachweis von einem H�ndler in 10 Tagen zu erbringen. Aber die Bearbeitung von Paypal darf 3 Monate dauern bis zur auszahlung? Wenn ich es �berhaupt bekomme - und mich eingentlich darauf verlassen habe. Das Handy ergab somit f�r ein schlechten Test. Leider kann ich auch nichts gutes schreiben da ich nicht das Original besitze. Das Handy funktioniert �berhaupt nicht und hat viele Fehler. �brigens habe ich Nokia kontaktiert wegen gef�schte Ware und die haben gesagt. Ja das ist ganz normal wenn man sich sowas bei Ebay ersteigert. Tja sehr gute L�sungsf�lle f�r ein Prestigehandy."	0
"Das Handy war uns schon bekannt, leider hatten wir zwischendurch ein anderes Handy von Motorola, das uns gar nicht gefiel. Das V3 RAZR ist ein leicht bedienbares Handy, das ich jedem nur w�rmstens empfehlen kann. Es ist gut zu bedienen. Ein sehr gutes Handy."	1
"Das Handy zeichnet sich durch seine einfache Bedienung, Zuverl�ssigkeit und Multimediale M�glichkeiten aus."	1
"Das ist das Handy was ich mir immer schon gew�nscht habe,aber f�r mich zu teuer war. Das Handy kann einfach alles was ich brauche."	1
"das ist schon das zweite galaxy round , und f�r sein serienalter ist es immer noch ein super Telefon von der bedienbarkeit , vom design und bei uns in �sterreich gibt es fast kein Galaxy round ,also ist es auch exklusiv  "	1
"Das N90 bekommt von mir leider ein mangelhaft,Begr�ndung wie folgt; Punkt 1: Die Schrift im Display viel zu klein,f�r Benutzer,die eine Lesebrille brauchen,v�llig ungeeignet. Punkt 2: Die Men�f�hrung ist viel zu kompliziert,es geht auch besser,siehe Samsung. Punkt 3: Die Akkulaufzeit ist ja wohl die Lachnummer,selbst nach austauschen des Akkus mu� man dieses Ger�t t�glich aufladen, Benutzung des Ger�tes eher unterdurchschnittlich,mit max. zwei Gespr�chen von 1 Minute.

"Das NOKIA 1208 ist ein einfach zu bediendes Handy. Ein schnelles zurecht kommen ist damit f�r jeden gew�hrleistet, auch f�r Einsteiger.

"Das Samsung SGH-E950 Handy ist ein optisch wie technisch einwandfreies Handy, dass ich wirklich nur weiter empfehlen kann.   Optisch besticht das SGH-E950 durch die chicke Optik, hevorgerufen durch das Metall auf der Vorder- und R�ckseite. Positiver Nebeneffekt des optischen Clou: Das Handy ist dadurch �u�erst stabil und vor St��en, Kratzern etc. gut gesch�tzt und lastet einem den Aufenthalt in Hosen-, Jacken- oder Handtasche nicht nach.  Das Display ist Samsung-Typisch hell und weist einen hohen Kontrast auf was der Farbwiedergabe zugute kommt. Die Verarbeitung ist echt gut, bedienerfreundlich und qualitativ hochwertig.   Das einzige Manko ist der etwas wackelige Slider. Die Funktionen die Samsung in dieses Handy gesteckt hat sind spitze. Mir hat nur das TV-Kabel gefehlt aber an sonsten nur Top!!! Habe das Ger�t hier zu einem sehr g�nstigen Preis &quot;ergattern&quot; k�nnen, was meine Begeisterung noch steigert! Ich kann das Handy aber auf jedem Fall 100%ig weiterempfehlen und bin absolut zufrieden."	1
"Das schwarze Handy nokia 7360 ist das handy f�r frauen oder f�r M�nner?   Das schwarze handy denke ich ist eher f�r M�nner, f�r Frauen sind die anderen Farben vom Handy genau richtig, au�erdem ist die Kamera sehr gut, fast so gut wie meine digi-cam. Das Handy ist das Beste, welches ich je hatte. ( hatte schon 5 handys )    Kann mir jemand sagen ob das schwarze Handy f�r M�nner gut ist oder ein Frauenhandy ist. ( m�chte es gerne meinem Mann schenken ist es eine gute Entscheidung.)    Bitte eine Nachricht schreiben,wenn das schwarze handy auch f�r m�nner gut ist."	1

"Dear Ladies and Gentlemen, Good Day.    I would like to inform You, that the Cellular Phone Nokia 8800 Sirocco (bought on E-Bay 01.12.12, nr.170905042361; Seller masum58 (572))  we receive in good order 06.12.12 (looks new, in &quot;original&quot; box with all accessories).   But from first days of using this Phone my Wife feel not comfort feeling during calling - strange head pain, &quot;sea seek&quot;.  And finally Phone worked only 2 weeks - first speaker started work with noise and after microphone not function any more.  Unfortunately I was out from home and my Wife didn&apos;t tell me anything before, in time.  1 week ago (I came back home) we brought Phone to Service Center and........ Service Man was in SHOCK when he knows  that we bought this Phone like original NOKIA and for such big Money!!!!  Service Man said that this is BAD CHINESE smuggling product, NOT ORIGINAL Nokia Phone (as was declared)!!!  Buy the way, shipment was from Chine, not from USA (as was declared)!!!    When he opened Phone, he found bad quality all parts (like already long time used), very poor quality of assembling and  problems not with microphone or speaker - problems with electronic components!!!!   TOTALLY GARBAGE FOR SUCH MONEY (448,98$+20% TAX)!!!"	0
"Dear potential customers,  DO NOT PURCHASE FROM THIS SELLER.  Adam Davis, of SellPhones and Sellphone2493@gmail.com, sold me a stolen phone.  According to the Verizon Wireless Network, the phone he sold me was stolen and incapable of being activated.  I notified him along with Paypal of this and he declined a request for a refund.  His lack of care for his customers has put a bad taste in my mouth and thus will probably do the same for you.  Also the &quot;PRISTINE&quot; label placed at the end of his product description was obviously not the truth...if you only saw the phone I received.  Thanks Adam Davis, you&apos;re business tactics are poor just like my rating of you.  Sincerely,  A customer who hoped to be satisfied with their purchase."	0
dear seller. your phone was wetted in water. you have deceived me. I ask to make full return for the rejected phone. if you pay transportation cost from my country costs $25 I will send you your rejected phone.	0
"Dear Seller;    Good Day,    The phone is of the best quality and deserve credits, however I am not satisfied since the phone does not use SIM card, [has no SIM Card SLOT] the problem which renders the phone unusable at all. This issue was not clearly listed on the &apos;phone description&apos;.    I bout the phone through my shipping address in New York, and I in Tanzania (East Africa) as I am writing this. No network which provides services on phones without purchasing their SIM Cards.    Please advise the best way to exchange this with a phone which uses SIM card. I can make some additional money to get the phone which meets my requirement.    Paul Sanene Msaki    [msasane]"	0

Decent phone with good features.  I gave it a low rating because many of the features are unusable (such as the FM radio) unless you purchase additional accessories.  The headset recepticle requires a special plug.  If Nokia is going to sell a $200 phone with an odd recepticle the least they could have done is include the cord or adapter.	0

"Decided to give oneplus a try after hearing great things and did not regret it! I like this more than the last 2 generations of galaxy s series phones I had (s7 edge & s8+). Went for the 6 instead of 6t because i refuse so buy a phone without a headphone jack until i have no other option. It's a wonderful phone for power users like myself, but battery life could be better. Oneplus dash charge more than makes up for it though."	1
"Decided to upgrade from my iPhone 5c to something a bit bigger with more RAM, storage, and a better camera. It's very fast and smooth. Very user friendly once you hey used to it. It's the perfect size too, larger screen but not oversized and pretty comfortable for your hand. Definitely worth trying out if you're looking to upgrade."	1

"DEFINITELY worth the purchase!!!  The 6 Plus is the best of both worlds.  Yes, the size is larger!  That is what I was missing by not having a Samsung Galaxy (which is what I owned before going to the Iphone 5S), now, I have the amazing size, with the AWESOME Apple service.  I couldn&apos;t be happier.  BTW, my husband got the 6, it&apos;s a little smaller than the Plus, but the features are just the same, both are amazing phones and we feel the phone is a great value.  We sold our perfect condition Iphone 5S phones and put the profit from them toward this purchase!  Take care of your Iphones!  They keep their value and make purchasing the new Iphones a little more affordable!  As expected, the upgrades seem to only get better and better!  Very happy customer!"	1

"Depending on how much you use your phone, if you use it all day like any other phone, the battery will be low.  But works as it should!  I couldn't download anything from the app store, so i cleared the search history, factory reset, and restart the phone a few times until I can download apps!  Cosmetically, the phone was excellent.  And it came with a charger!"	1
"depite of  is a 2013 phone. it still runs the app smoothly. good battery life . it can last 2 or 3 days with normal use. I have no complain about the screen resolucion and size (just fine, satisfied my needs). if wanna go on the budget I highly recommend this phone "	1
"Der Kauf hat sich als absoluter Fehlkauf erwiesen. Das Handy besitzt nach �berpr�fung in mehreren Fachgesch�ften/Vertretungen eine festeingebaute SIM-Karte, sodass die SIM-Karte meines Providers nicht eingesetzt werden konnte.  Das Handy ist damit f�r mich als solches nicht nutzbar und wird daher Zur�ckgeschickt"	0
Described perfectly. I love it	1
"Description did not include the broken ear speaker which sounds terrible to the point where I mostly use speaker phone when calling. Stated there were minor scratches when in fact the middle of the screen looked like someone took a key and had a field day scratching not up. Phone also seems bugged restarting randomly as many as 3 times a day. Very unsatisfied, use caution when purchasing from this seller."	0

Y no llego para dicho viaje cuando llego todo bien solo que el adaptador OTG NO VENIA  "	0
"Design : This phone is a little bit bulky because it is almost 0.65 inch thick. Micro SD card, Mini USB, volume button, camera button at front, and slight out full physical QWERTY key board to the left are convenient and good design. 4 rows slide-out full QWERTY key board is pretty solid.     Calling : When this phone receive a call, it says by voice who is calling &amp;amp;amp; number; his or her numbers. Voice from speaker is pretty clear. Call can be reject with message like whichever messages a person want to type it. A few of the excuse messages are already typed.              Messaging : Text, Email and SMS functions are pretty good. When phone is on messaging screen, it shows the person to all available messaging functions. This is very good and it can be attach Pictures, Videos, Audios, Slideshows, Capture pictures, videos, and Record audios.          Email : For the Yahoo! Email &amp;amp;amp;; Instant messaging and AOL Email &amp;amp;amp; AIM, Android apps are better. Google Mail &amp;amp;amp; Chat are already installed and these are pretty good, but Google talk is only for chat and does not have Sign Out function like it can sign out totally (not like sign out from Google talk or chat screen). It does not have verbally talk function either. I wish it would have been like talk verbally thru Google talk by mobile phone. It can also get the cooperated or job email.        YouTube : YouTube video can be watched in Normal view. When it is on the High Definition View, it loads for several minutes. Some High Definition YouTube videos loaded more than several minutes. High Definition View is very clear (clearer than normal view).     Camera : Although it has 3.2 Megapixel camera, it does not have flash LCD &amp;amp;amp; 1.5 megapixel front facing camera for visually insight communication. LCD Flash for rear megapixel &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; front facing megapixel camera are real lack of functions &amp;amp;amp; features for me.    3G mobile broadband : 3G speed is very fast. Although it is 3G, data icon shows EU. Browsing the Web thru Google search engine &amp;amp;amp; Web browser are very convenient. Making payment, receiving payment and transferring to bank account are safe &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; secure.     GPS, Map, Navigation, Latitude :  This function has Google maps so it is very accurate even though it states approximately within 30 meter accuracy. GPS, Map, Navigation, Latitude have car route, public transportation (either local or distance), bicycle route, and walk route functions so it will get exactly where a person want to reach.     Battery life : At least, it last over 2 day depending on the browsing on the internet.    Adapter or wall charger : This thing is with USB cable so it is very convenient to connect whichever device.    Side micro SD slot : This phone has side micro SD card slot and it can be stored up to 32 GB of micro SD which is very convenient.     Top-Up : This phone is able to Top-Up and beyond talk.    All of these smart phones must have quad band capability which means I can purchase whichever unlocked quad band smart phones I want and it must be working with Virgin Mobile USA. Every smart phone and tablet must have this swype keyboard within exactly on its own size. For me, all of these functions &amp;amp;amp; features, phone service are just convenient communication tool. These are very crucial and must not compromise at all."	0
"Design moderno, espessura fina, leve, visor grande, tamanho pr�tico, f�cil de manusear e de levar no bolso"	1
"Design/Build:   The major issues with this two-fold: 1) it feels cheap so youre really just waiting for it to break on you, and 2) it takes a second for it to actually flip, so you get this weird sense of delay. Its kind of cool pressing the side button; but it gets old.   The data port and charge ports are both on the top of the phone which may be a problem if you are in the habit of charging while talking on the phone. The keys are smooth, flat, and mirrored.  This is going to be a matter of opinion between people, but I personally like buttons that give you some sense of feedback and there simply was none here.  It was also put together very poorly as you could see light leaking out around every seam in the plastic.  Software/Functions:   The phone itself seemed sluggish, and many keys didnt respond without being pushed a couple times.  It found my Bluetooth headset with very little effort, and connected to it very well.   Calls were very quiet and had a scratchy feel to them, though this was solved through use of a headset, so I suspect it was the onboard speaker.  Calls also had an odd habit of not going where you wanted them too.  For instance, while calling my mother, I was connected to Mexico.  Every time!  It seems Nokia automatically assumes you are dialing an international number, and is expecting your country code first.  Since I didnt program my contacts as 1 (area code) number, and instead simply (area code) number, none of my calls or texts worked.   I use my phones primarily for business, and as such, I make great use of the mute button when on conference calls.  Now, Nokia forgot to put one on this phone.  While on a call, you can go to options, scroll down to mute, and the call is muted.  By the way, those key tones your phone is making are also playing into your call.  Not cool.  When its your turn to speak and you wish to unmute your line, youre better off just hanging up and calling back.  Where the Mute option was is now an option to put it into speaker phone (still muted) or to the handset (also still muted).  After a few failed conference calls, I found the unmute option . . . at the bottom of another menu entirely.   There is no key lock on this phone; none. Side keys can be activated at any time.  This means you get to delete pics of the inside of your pocket a lot, and occasionally you will find that your phone has been turned off.   The camera responded quickly (1.3MP) and the phone features Pict-Bridge so you can link it directly to a printer to get your pics off and onto paper. On top of that, whatever image processor Nokia threw into this thing has issues with color and lighting   This phone does feature a nifty little tool in its radio application.  With a special headset (included in my package) you can tune through FM stations and save and name your favorites.  The stations are then browsable through a button on the headphones, or the arrow keys on the phone.  The tuner is a decent quality and the headphones were loud and clear.  This was almost a solid good point for the phone . . . almost.   When switching between stations, the display doesnt update.  Though youve changed stations 12 or so times, it still says you are on your first station.  In order to actually see what station you are on, you have to open the phone, go through 4 menus, and reopen the radio app (which technically never closed in the first place).  It also eats battery power like popcorn.    Only 1 star is enough."	0
"Despite being plugged in for a re-charge, this particular phone will not show having a charge above 40%.  I am concerned about the reliability of this particular phone and will try contacting the seller."	0
"Despite contacting the merchant prior to buying the phone to verify it was fully functional and being told it was, I received the phone the day before my son's birthday to find out the touch screen didn't work on the phone. Then I waited almost a week to receive a refund in order to buy a new one "	0
"Despite not being made of metal make no mistake this is a quality phone with a just brilliant back screen. If you like me use an e-reader this phone saves me carting around two devices. If you also use this screen for an always on watch for  messages and tell the time, you will find the battery lasts ages. The software is very classy as is everything about this handset. One drawback is there isn't many cases that you can get that allow you full use of both screens and, keep it safe if drops as it is a little slippy. A total bargain now the company have dropped its price. Get one and impress yourself and your friends.   "	1
"Despite some of the negative reviews I&apos;ve read, (after using the phone myself), it turns out that I like this phone. Alot of people have said the phone freezes up. Well yes, that did happen when I first received the phone, before activating it on my Sprint account. I contacted Sprint through Customer Support through live chat. While activating the phone I told the chat agent about the phone freezing up issue. She stated that she had reset my device from her end, asked me to power the phone off then back on again. And the issue was resolved. I have been enjoying the phone since that day with no other freezing issues. I have dropped it on a hard floor while shopping and that didn&apos;t harm it at all. It still works perfectly. And may I add that I bought this phone (used) here on eBay, and to say that it was used, it works as if it&apos;s brand new. You can&apos;t always go by what you read in reviews. Sometimes it&apos;s best to experience things for yourself. For anyone else having issues with their phone freezing, maybe Sprint can fix your issue like they did for me. It wouldn&apos;t hurt to give them a call before returning it.    Now as for the features: I don&apos;t like the fact that the phone does not have a file manager to view what&apos;s on the memory card. All other phones I&apos;ve owned all had that option. This is the first phone I&apos;ve had without it. I assumed all phones had it, but I guess I was wrong. Pictures, videos, music, ect are saved to the card. You only access the files through the apps, such as the music player, and the fun menu. I wouldn&apos;t recommend using the phones default browser because it is not full screen. It&apos;s best to use the Opera that is pre-installed on it. Call quality is great, mp3 files play very loud and clear. The touch screen is very responsive. The phone is user friendly. Another thing I wish were different is the phone&apos;s wallpaper. You only get to see it when you press the power/lock button briefly to check the time. It only displays for about 5 seconds. As much as I love downloading wallpapers it&apos;s a bit disappointing not to see it most of the time. You also see it when you receive a text but only lightly dimmed when the phone displays the option to view or dismiss the message. Other than lacking a file manager and the wallpaper, I really like this phone. And I&apos;ll most likely be using it until it&apos;s time for an upgrade on my account."	1
Despues de llevar el movil a liberar para poder usarlo en espa�a me dicen que este movil est� bloqueado permanentemente que est� declarado como robado o perdido. Me parece inadmisible.	0
Despues que me vendi� el tel�fono me sali� que no se podia enviar a trav�s de un forwarder de mi propiedad en Miami donde me llegan cientos de paquetes de ebay desde hace 10 a�os. Vivo en Rep Dom y nunca me hab�a sucedido esto con un vendedor de ebay. Demasiado complicado y exigente. Muy molesto con su actitud.	0
"Detailed Review: First, let me say that, for the price, you cannot compare this phone to other $300 budget phones. This phone has a much larger screen and a Stylus. The most comparable phone to this phone speed wise would probably be the Moto G6 for $250, but keep in mind the Moto G6 does not come with a Stylus, and has a smaller screen. "	1
"Device arrived ahead of schedule and in very good condition. As described, if not better! Great seller and quality product! "	1
Device barely connects to the cell service and constantly looses signal	0
Device does not meet the reality and the seller refuses to receive it . seller very bad .I would advise not to deal with him 	0
Device has an okay battery life but once the battery starts to get low the screen response becomes erratic and gets even worse if trying to use while charging. The device also restarts randomly which can be an inconvenience. It's also been scrambling/freezing the screen and giving off a high pitched squeal sound before it eventually shuts off.	0
"Device is as way better than described by the seller, only fault so far is the back camera not focusing so the image is always blurry but it works excellent in low light rooms. "	1
"Device is definitely NOT NEW! More like refurbished product. Or Used Device With New Parts. Box was in poor condition with new products in it! Something didn't seem right, so I pulled the back cover off and shows glue to hold the back cover on and it's showed 1 missing screw and all the other screws was stripped, As if someone repaired in their basement, (tacky job) therefore that concludes that you are selling refurbished phones as new products. (open inbox) ON A POSITIVE NOTE What I can say is that sellers description was spot on! Very detailed description witch is very good! However it's obvious the SO CALLED NEW INBOX phones are not even tested either! Now I have a useless device with no sound. Thanks Amazing Wireless For Selling Me An Untested refurbished product. I will NEVER PURCHASE USED OR NEW OPEN BOX PRODUCTS FROM YOU EVER AGAIN."	0
Device is easy to use and a solid phone. The metal back makes it feel solid and not cheap and plastic unlike a lot of new devices (samsung). I have worked for t-mobile and sprint and this is my favorite phone that i have ever had the pleasure to use. It is fast and intuitive and works as it should. Its not to big and its not small either. It takes a beating unlike most never phone like the iPhone and Galaxy S3 that break after one drop. This holds up and keeps on kicking. I would recommend this to first time sell phone buyers as well as smart phone gurus as myself. All people will be pleased. overall an amazing device.	1
"Device is not unlocked, half of the screen is half way out on one side, phone dies even when battery is at 100%, only charges sometimes, tends to shut off and not come on for hours,and works very slowly"	0
device is perfect and is what the seller said it would be. it runs smoothly and is a great device.I needed a new phone and turned to the droid 2 since I have heard many great things about the phone.	1

Did not get a chance to see the phablet until this week. It was advertised as new and it was refurbished. The screen was scratched.

Did not purchase this item due to the fact that I thought it was a blue phone when in reality it was a black phone. I tried to dispute this case and got nowhere. Now it counts against me. The seller was also very rudw to me when I tried to explain it to them. They even stated that if i couldn&amp;apos;t read right that I should not be bidding. The picture clearly show blue. If it was black thenthey should of had a black picture on there.	0

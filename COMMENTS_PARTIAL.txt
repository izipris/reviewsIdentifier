"  As of this review there are Note 5's on the market. Picked up a new Note 3 for less than 1/2 the cost of the newest model. At less then $300 buying the phone outright is better than making payments to a carrier in my opinion.    I like the big screen on this phone. It's easier to read text, watch videos, and view images. The S-pen makes it easy and fast to interact with the phone's many features.   If your primary needs are for text and phone this Note 3 is probably more than you'd need.    If you want an easy to view screen combined with features of a notepad this Samsung is a good choice."	1

 I am very happy with this iPhone 7.  It was rated a 9 out of 10 but I saw nothing wrong with it. I think it is a very good value. 	1
 I bought a cell phone and it came without the chip and memory port. How can I use a cell phone without a chip? Only by wifi.!	0
 I bought this as a back up phone and it works perfectly and is cosmetically perfect Im very happy with my purchase	1
 I bought this phone refurbished and it looks and works like a new phone! Battery life is good and if the battery ever wears out I can replace it thanks to the removable battery. 	1

" purchased a Sony Xperia Z3 compact one month ago from Amazon with Warranty. Liked the phone and the features.  Today  I went to the hardware store. And then drove to my siste""s house.  I deceided to text her that I was there and ready to paint her garage.    I could not swipe the top of the screen.  Noticed a crack in upper left hand corner.  The phone is in an aluminum framed case and is covered from day one with tempered glass screen protectors.  The screen protector is undamaged.  The phone has never been dropped or sat on.  I carry the phone in the side pocket of my carpenter pants. Take it out when I get to my destination.   I contacted Sony support chat online for warranty repair.  Spoke to a Jason.  After he asks me  a bunch of questions even though I started the chat with information I gave above.  Then tells me I'm sorry, Sony does not cover this kind of damage.   I will never buy a Sony product again.  Sony should be ashamed and dishonored.  You have been warned.  Look else where for your electronics."	0

" The Bad: 1.) The Robin speaker likes to crackle a lot on calls, with the internal speaker, but also when used on speaker phone (and very badly in that case). Uncertain if android bug, or problem with Robin. 2.) Microphone seems poorly placed or something. Many people cannot hear me unless I take my ear away from the speaker and move my mouth down right over the Mic. I've also had issues where the mic stopped working randomly (and it is not on mute), then randomly began working again. 3.) Structurally the Robin is not very durable, if you watch any of the Bend Tests online, it snaps right in half. This is worrying, but at the same time, I don't make a habit of bending my phones violently. 4.) Type C usb is good but also bad because it means if you want two charge cords, prepare to spend $50, unless you'd like to fry your phone as Benson warns of.  5.) No USB OTG support 6.) No MicroSD support, so you're stuck with just 32 gigs of space, which really isn't much. I'll never understand why we are limited so much on space, and yet I can go out and for 60 dollars buy a 256 gig usb stick. The phone market frustrates me on account of this, and it's why I went with a cheaper phone, rather than a 900 dollar iphone or google pixel. I refuse to pay such high prices for such small storage, r"	0
 The cell phone is reported as stolen and therefore can not be unlocked. the cell phone can not be given any kind of use.	0
" The LG Rebel 4 is a great starter phone for those who wish to transition from a flip phone to a smartphone. Very simple to set up, yet has a lot of features of the higher priced phones. It comes with ample talk, text, and data for those who are not power users. It has an easy to navigate menu system, with enough built in APPS to make it a very useful tool. The only draw back to this phone is the short battery life. Under normal use it needs to be recharged about every other day."	0
 The seller asked him to sing the deal does not accept is good	0
 this apple 6s is not user friendlt.  I have spent 50 hrs trying to get setup the way I need it.  To start with it does not have a back button.  If you fumblr fong3er something you have a hard  time correcting it.  when ever you need to go to many places you must enter name & pass word. the range of ringtone volume is too limited.  to many items do not defauilt to a normal setting and you have to find where you can change a setting to make it work. I have weather on my phone for 2 cities that I dont care about and cannot find how to delete them.I guess i'm stuck with this junk until comcast can figure how to make their system work with android phones	0
" This model has very few figures, I thought it had conference call figures among other, but it doesn't a little disappointed. Thank you."	0
 UPDATE #1 I talked with Ectaco 2 more times. The first time I was told I Broke my phone and that I would have to send the phone to China to be fixed and I would have to pay for it and it would take 2 months !!! So I told the guy off and filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau and wrote the previous post and posted it on there distributors adds on the net. After a few weeks I called again and talked with teck support this time. He said they were willing to give me a NEW PHONE with the latest updates if I would remove my reviews on their distributors web adds. I said I would update my review. They said their distributors were pretty upset. How do they think I felt? It took almost a year of bitching and filing this review to get them to replace my phone. It is sad when companys make customers go to this extent to get customer service. They did send me a NEW PHONE and one of their teck guys even emailed me all my contacts. Thank you for finally getting this straightened out. I went to update the reviews on AMAZON and they were removed ???????      I would like to give my experience with Ectaco Inc. and the I travl 2 also look them up at the BBB and complaints on line. In Oct of 2015 I bought an I travl 2 that was suppose to have Spanish in it. I paid to have it delivered 	0
" very happy with the phone, it was just like advertised. Connected to my service with ease"	1
" When I receive my phone I was excited like anyone else.  Sadly, I discovered that I had to hold the charging cord in order for the phone to begin charging. It was  not a faulty cord but rather the charging port on the phone.  The phone would not hold the micro USB cable in place. "	0

"&quot;With all the great features of this phone, I still can&apos;t believe what a great deal I got when I purchased it. I got a really, really great deal (too low too mention), but I would have paid more (shh...it&apos;s just between us), because I just fell in love with this phone as soon as I saw it! After doing a little research online, I found out that this phone had many more capabilities than just the ones T-Mobile had told me about in the store. From listening to my .Mp3 files with the built-in .Mp3 player, to using .3gp files as ring tones, to flipping the camera around to take perfect pictures, to the microSD slot...even taking calls on my Samsung WEP180 Bluetooth headset using the built-in Bluetooth feature, this phone had me whirring for a long time after buying it. I wish T-Mobile had left the A/V in/out feature on the phone when ordering, but then again, I might not have put down the phone to eat in that case! Even after 2 years of use, it still takes a licking and keeps on ticking. I just can&apos;t wait until I get my hands on one of the newer mobile phones, such as the Samsung Behold! I&apos;m sure I&apos;ll be mesmerized for another few years until Samsung comes out with something great again! Thanks Samsung!&quot;"	1
"(I previously owned P800) same size or even bigger screen, it&apos;s an upgrade indeed, I never made desireable to combine camera and phone - this one does not have one, it has unique keyboard - allmost full alfabet on reach of an fingertip, it&apos;s size and weight, and only thing dislike - the &quot;go back&quot; key to manuver in menues is in quite unreachalbe position on a side! Why did I bought it? - because of very reasonable price!"	1

", Phone/Tablet Is Barely ok, Even Good If You Dont Need The Phone Features Really. Although Their Are Several Tablets You Can Buy Cheaper Than This, They Dont Have Phone Capability, Which makes This One Unique!!! However The Speaker & Camera Are BAD Quality & Dont Work Properly. The Back Camera Is A 2 Mega Pixel Not 5 & Front Seems To Be Only .5 or 1 at best.  For Being A Phone Its Not Worth It, But As A Tablet Maybe, Although As I Said Earlier You Van Buy Many Tablets Cheaper Than This. Its Pretty, & A Great Size. But Not Worthy Of Phone Classification. Because Although The Signal Is Good, The Sound System Is VERRY GLITCHY.  I Personally Love The size, But Also Hate The Fact That You CanNOT Find A Protector That Fits It Perfectly Like You Can For So Many In case Of Dropping! So far I've tryed a 8.4 that does Not Fit. I will try 8inch Next &, tell you if it works. I'll add to my review as I know more & Find out More From This Phablet."	0

"...EVER larger phones (even Apple admitted such by introducing their 4"" screen version!), but this smaller Samsung mini has - so far - been excellent!"	1
"...unfortunatley, I must've gotten hold of a lemon :( When I was able to activate, the phone wouldn't hold a signal (no bars), see photo attached. Contacted phone service provider who checked our signal...we're fine, but phone wasn't. Refreshed signal, restarted phone multiple times, nothing helped; tested inside and outside, as well as in town--no bars. Battery life wasn't so good after only checking emails, 1/4 to 1/3 used up. Cover and phone looked clean overall, but charge cover (little side plate) wouldn't shut tight, compromising water resistance feature. Finally, the GPS as advertised is NOT a navigational GPS feature...so forget MAPS app, or any app...can't download. That particular feature was really important for me. "	0

": Have a LOOK at this VIDEO first:   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFKYVE__Mug     Just take 2 minutes and read this. This is very EASY to do! It literally takes 10 minutes to setup. Simply follow the steps below. I promise you, this is 100% real. I would not jeopardize my eBay account status if this were a fraud. My feedback is real. Here is what you do. Click on the link below, register, pick an account type (referral is the easiest) and complete just 1 offer (Very important that you complete an offer otherwise your account will sit in limbo until you do). This is not like other sites where you need to complete one offer on 2 or 3 different pages. Many of these offers are FREE TRIALS with nothing else to buy with NO COMMITMENTS!     -Step 1: Click or Copy &amp; Paste this link to your address bar:   http://www.FlashiPods4free.com/index.php?ref=63681    -Step 2: Sign up and chose an account type (Referral is the easiest and best).     -Step 3: Complete just 1 offer (I recommend EyeMyCredit). If you dont cancel your membership within the 7-day trial period, you will be billed $12.95 for each month that you continue your membership. :-D Trust me choose this offer and check your credit report as well. Remember to cancel your membership within 7-day, if you don&apos;t want to get billed $12.95.     -Step 4: Then Refer 8 people to do the same as you did.   *** It is very important to do Step 3 first then refer 8 people to do the same (use eBay, MySpace, Face Book, blogs, friends, etc.! Do what I did; copy my ad). ***     -Step 5: Once everything is 100% complete just place your order. Then you will receive your 32 GB iPod Touch for FREE in several weeks (The SHIPPING is FREE!). Trust me it is worth it.     The reason these companies make money, is that most people do not bother getting all the referrals. All you have to do is post it on eBay or other website I mention before! They use us as advertisement by word of mouth, which saves those tons of money that goes toward yours and my gift. These are legit companies such as Blockbuster, Netflix, Game fly, etc... You can copy my listing if you want. You must use your own authentic link though. You will get your own personal link after you signed up and choose an account type.     I know this sounds ridiculous but it works! For proof that this is for real, click on the links below.

{hone sucks. In a tools menu and close the phone but it stays in the phone menu. When the phone is closed for a long time the main screen goes blank. When the phone is opened it does not wake up right away. You have to wait 5 minutes while your pushing all the button trying to figure out to wake it up. Read the manual twice and can&apos;t find any wake up option.    don&apos;t like it.	0

"1, first of all sellers indicate the new thing, is actually a refurbished machine.  2, many times to contact the seller, the seller didn&apos;t respond to a message.  3, wait for 20 days later, opened the case and Paypal investigation.  4, Paypal after intervention, the seller forced to apply for a replacement.  5, just like I encounter people, there is another.  Comprehensive evaluation: the seller irresponsible, not into the proper communication. But there is something wrong with the good faith.  Comprehensive evaluation is less than 90%, it is recommended that you carefully consider the sellers."	0
"1. Awesome signal coverage:  I have good signal when my wife and kids who are on the same network have little or none.     2. Awesome battery life: I had noticed it seemed to last forever, even when I talked alot, then I forgot to charge it for 2 days straight and have had to talk a lot too...guess what...I&apos;ve still got 3 out of 5 bars of battery life!    3. Great screen, graphics and camera.    4. WLAN coverage is great.    My last phone was a Nokia and so bad I thought I&apos;d never buy another one.  I am really happy I gave them another chance. The E51 is awesome!"	1

Does not want to help with shipping or seem to care if we ever get a phone that works. Very, Very, terrible service. Gave the seller ever chance to make this right. My son has went without a phone for all this time that the trips back and forth to UPS have taken place. Think about the service you will get before you buy from this yo-yo."	0

A couple of weeks ago my phone went out on me and stopped working. I was in desperate need of a replacement and saw them selling the exact same phone for a great price and couldnt believe it! it was listed as used so i expected a little ware.i had to try though needless to say some lucky bidding n a few days later i was surprised with a phone that looked new out of box deff. blown away and would do business again thank u so much!   Hope ur around for a long time	1

"A good reliable device that performs as it is supposed to.  A good phone with a fast processor. The phone has such a low friction surface, that dropping it is something to be wary of, but other than that, the phone is one of the best I've owned yet and I have had many phones."	1

"A great looking phone, in good working condition. The only thing about the phone, the back plate seems has if it has been painted black. There is a tiny spot of burgundy showing through, other then that love the phone and still will refer the seller to friends and family."	1
"A great phone I feel this phone is worth every penny  And do you know why? Simple: the HTC One is one of the best-designed phones on the planet. Not content with inventing a new machining process to allow the body to be all aluminium, the Taiwanese firm has extended the screen to the edges of the chassis further than ever before, meaning you&apos;re getting a 4.7-inch Full HD display without the additional heft you&apos;d probably expect."	1

"A nice solid phone. Unlike the LGK8 2017 this one has gyros so you can use apps like google sky, etc. Definitely good for the value. I don't know why anyone would want anything more than this one. "	0
a perfect upgrade from my Iphone 4. Very happy in all respects.	1
a phone i ordered it didn&apos;t work on my t-mobile sim card i tried on different sim cards but it still didn&apos;t work.I like the phone but it does&apos;t work so it worthless for me. the phone still sit on my desk.	0
"A phone itself looks o.k., but I cannot use it, since Sprint announced it &quot;lost or stolen&quot;. After hours spent on corresponding with the seller, and on the phone with Sprint, I gave up. Sprint had offered me a newer phone at no charge, though. I DO NOT reccommend buying used cell phones on ebay, unless all the serial numbers have been checked with the carrier."	0
"A phone was sent to me that didn&apos;t work, it wouldn&apos;t even give a power signal to charge. Now I can&apos;t even find there store to return it. I would never recommend this seller."	0
A plug and play product for our T-Mobile cell phone plan/sim card.  No issues with start up and was able to be online within minutes of powering on.  Delivered on time.  Looked great right out of the box.	1
A really good phone	1
A replacement phone as the battery is no good. Now they want me to send it back and be without a phone? How am I going to stay in contact afrer phone was send back???? 	0
"A terrible experience.  The iPhone is crashed and sunken. The seller declared it is in ""Excellence""  condition and is sold at higher price.  The battery is wear out and need to be exchanged.  "	0
a top phone you will never go wrong with this phone no matter what you do battery life is good and talk time even tho this phone is over 10yrs old it still ranks at the top 10/10	1
"A used device with corporate security that I couldn&apos;t erase. Even with a security key.  I tried to wipe the phone many times, but each time the same problems."	0
A very easy to use mobile and user friendly. Performance is excellent and also battery life. A very good product and a very good price.	1
a very good phone and I love the slide out keypad. It is chargeable and durable and works awesome. a must have phone for the person who texts a lot.	1
"A very good seller, it is worth recommending, look forward to the next cooperation!"	1
"A very nice and excellent, it has plenty of features, and it does just about anything you want it to do. A great phone for a great price..."	1
"A very reliable salesman, the description the 100% truthful one of the article! Thanks, I hope to return to buy some of its articles!"	1
A week after I bought this it powered down and wouldn't power back up. Try the soft and hard reboot but got nothing. Paid to have a new battery installed and still broke. Not worth my time or effort to return.	0
A well refurbished phone. Well satisfied with the product. A really good little phone which fits in the pocket easily. Just what I wanted. Unfortunately I misread the description (my fault) thinking that the phone would come unlocked. This error cost me another 20 getting it unlocked. Having said this I still give this seller a 5 star rating. I have already recommended this seller to friends and will continue to do so if they want a refurbished phone for a very reasonable price.	1
"A) I bought for my kids  B) I do not like the product because I have not been here in my country enabled RD because they knew that when &quot;TracFone&quot; say they serve here. According explained to me on the telephone office that these phones work with an antenna of lowest frequency used in my nation.  C) There would buy this product again because it has to be a warning from the seller with such information to users of ebay so we can buy with greater confidence, because now I lost the cost of the 2 devices and what the shipping cost to the Dominican Republic, as a customer I am very dissatisfied, is money wasted."	0

"About 1 year ago, US Cellular stopped supporting pre-paid US Cellular phones for customers who had contracts.  The phone I purchased was not a normal contract phone but a pre-paid phone that is useless.  It can not be connected to US Cellular network.  I believe that the seller should have known this.  Also, the charger that was included did not work.  I&apos;m out the $25.00 and have a dilemma - If I return the useless phone, how do I know that it won&apos;t get re-sold to another person allowing the scam to continue.  Maybe it was a mistake by the seller, but if it was he was selling more than one phone of this type and I am sure he must of heard from other buyers."	0
About this as a replacement phone and now I regret it the battery does not stay charged longer than 30 minutes to an hour at the most very frustrating	0
absolute garbage. The only worse phone made is a ZTE flip.	0
"Absolutely great seller. We had problem with handset and a replacement was promptly sent. Wow, before we know it, everything worked out great. I really thought I lost my money on this purchase but all ended well.    Thank you. Thank you. Thank you."	1
"absolutely hot wet garbage. have not been able to connect to Sprint network as advertised.  Whoever refurbished it did it no justice. It came with no battery, which I ended up buying and still I couldn't connect to Sprint with this Sprint-advertised phone...smh"	0
"Absolutely love it, exactly what I wanted thank  you THANKS!"	1
Absolutely love this Blackberry Curve for MetroPCS. Awesome phone with no contract and excellent service.	1
Absolutely love this phone. Great value also. I recommend this brand to friends all the time. The camera is great and video also.	1
Absolutely the best phone to update to that can still fit in a pocket!	1
Absolutely wonderful...... 	1
Absolutey perfect ebayer.  Couldn&apos;t be happier.  Everything was exactly as stated in the product description.  Received shipment extremely fast and was a great value for what it was listed for.  I would highly recommend to anyone and everyone.	1
According to Sprint this phone was not even worth the shipping and handling. But i can play the bubble game. Sprint could not get the phone up and running. I really wasted money having just being out of work and needing the phone for my new job.	0
Accurate description phone works great	1
"Accurate discription, fast delivery and follow through on missing piece. Thank you for an excellent transaction."	1
"accurate product description, good value many thanks"	1
"actually he put on the tital used phone and in the discription he put faulty i just read the tital and condition used then i bid but it was wrong the phone was faulty he didnot mention on top so price was too much as faulty thats why i didnot pay for this phone, thats the only reason i never pay for this item, thanks a lot.   sajid"	0
ACTUALLY I CANT SAY NOTHING ABOUT THIS PHONE HTC HD7 BECAUSE I BOUGHT IT FOR SOMEONE BUT I THINK IS GOING TO BE A CHALLANGE PHONE.	1
Actually I think it's better than the .But that depends your needs.	1
"Actually, I am waiting to here back from them because we need to return the phone. It doesn&apos;t receive reception anywhere and freezes up all the time. My daughter loves the way the phone looks but after getting it for christmas and trying to use it, it was a waste of money."	0
Acually it didn&apos;t work even though I wrote to the seller before I bought and asked if the mobile works in Malta (Europe). That means I bought it for nothing cause it is locked to Malta&quot;s network.	0
"Add says New, definitely not. Headphones not clean or new. Battery barely lasts the day."	0

"Advertised as a 4g phone. It is a 3g phone. Tracfone in 4 months no longer services or supports this phone. When registering phone with tracfone. I was informed this phone is no longer supported by tracfone, and it can't be used for phone service. Offered to replace phone with one that is compatible, but no way of knowing what phone it is until it show up in the mail box. So needless to say. They are advertising these phones as 4g knowing full well they are 3g. And now the new phone they are sending me is not a triple minutes phone. I want my money back. "	0
"Advertised as unlocked, I arrived in Australia to put in a sim card and have it say that it was not valid and that the phone was locked.  That was the first problem.  The second one is that the phone did not hold a charge.  In fact you could see the battery power draining visibly on the phone.  Just not a good deal.  I returned it for a refund."	0
"Affordable, yet one of the best phones out there...only missing a GPS, but oh well...Phone GPS arent good anyways...(except maybe iphone or so i hear)"	1
"After 2 other attempts at trying to buy a s6 Edge for Verizon from other vendors, I finally came across these guys.  Third time was definitely a charm!!!  The phone came in just a few days, which is saying something since I live in the middle of no where Montana.  The phone itself was in immaculate condition for being used and considered ""very good""...this was like brand new.  I was amazed.  I have had absolutely no issues with this phone in the 3wks I've had it and it is more than I was hoping for.   I would definitely buy from these guys again.  I'm impressed!"	1
after 3 days this phone started shutting itself off...and got progressively worse within 4 days... I couldn&apos;t check a text or change screens without it shutting off.. horrible phone! I am very disappointed in LG!	0
After 41 days this phone stopped taking a charge. And because it goes over the 41 day ebay gaurantee they will not trade for another  phone. All the seller can say is try plugging it in a different way. We have been Samsung users for many many years and never had a phone just no longer charge after 41 days. It's obviously defective and the seller doesn't care. Just check other reviews...	0
After 7 days from date of Pay Pal payment I still do not have the phone.  The listing stated delivery 3-7 days.  Now it has changed to unknown???  Don&apos;t count on getting what you pay for with free shipping in a timely manner.  I would have bought a similar item and paid for shipping had I known I could not count on a delivery by the 7th day from payment.	0
After a few months of extensive use I found no cons only pros. Affordable and reliable. If you want a phone like the 1k phones move on. For the money this is a superb deal.	1
"After a month of use, the phone died. Seller was to refund $50.00 towards the cost of a replacement battery. Two batteries and three months later I am still waiting. Junk."	0
"After a week of waiting I emailed the seller asking about the phone. They responded quickly saying they would check. Somehow the phone couldn't be located so I was refunded my money. Disappointed, really wanted the phone especially since I ordered a case and screen protectors."	0
After about two weeks the phone stop receving calls. I took it to a verizon location and they said it could not be fixed. Don&amp;apos;t waste your money on this one	0
"After accepting my offer and payment was made unable to ship the phone as promised. I posted payment immediately, and contacted the seller to ship the phone. Seller stated that it has been already shipped but unable to provide tracking #. Seller changed mind and make it look like I requested to cancel the transaction. Not a trusted seller. "	0
"After being a diehard Android user and having owned nothing but Google Nexus products (Galaxy Nexus phone and Nexus 7 tablet) I switched to an iPhone primarily because I was tired of having two devices for music and phone. I thought I would give the iPhone a try. I am very impressed. iOS 7 is very fluid and smooth (much more so than Kit Kat 4.4). I can still sync my Google services such as contacts, calendar and mail with absolutely no problems. I feel like I have the best of both worlds. I am going to have a tough time going back to Android.I like the smaller phone as it easily fits and can be used by one hand.     I never thought I would like the iPhone but I am quickly becoming a dedicated convert. I may possibly convert to iPad in the future."	1
"After buying this lg440g, Tracfone said it wouldn&apos;t work in Montana, so they traded me for an inferior phone that didn&apos;t fold, but did have a keyboard that i didn&apos;t need so I bought a model that would work in MT., and still had a camera in it. Anyone interested in a fancy LG505C Tracfone that they won&apos;t take back, please contact me thru e-bay. $10.00 plus first class which should cost about $3.00."	0
"After exchanging messages i knew what i was buying, he cancel for no reason and not even asking if its ok for it.. bad bad seller"	0
"After first turn on to go through the settings, I realized that the battery was not fully charged. so I put the phone to charge, and next day when I try to resume the settings, the phone would not work. I put a return request immediately, the seller approved the return, and once the phone was delivered to the seller, the refund to my account was received shortly after. I was sorry the phone did not work, since it was a gift to my wife, but I was pleased with the prompt customer service."	0
"After getting through a few minor technical glitches, with the help of the seller, I'm in love with this phone.  I needed a smart phone but did not need the features of the larger, newer phones.  The size is perfectly compact.  It performs all the functions that I need with great ease and is a great little work horse!"	1
After having a very bad experience with another seller over the same phone . I am in Heaven with    My Galaxy Note 4 purchased through compustore2020 . You have a returning Customer for life   for all my cellular needs. Thank You so much  	1
"AFTER HAVING MY NOCIA N75 FOR TWO MONTHS, THE DISPLAY SCREEN TURNS BLACK AFTER ABOUT EIGHT HOUR OF USEAGE, AFTER NOTIFING NOKIA.COM I WAS INFORMED THAT I DI NIT HAVE A WARANTY ON THE PHONE, INFORMED THEM I RECENTLY PURCHUSED THE PHONE TWO MONTHS AGO AND I SHOULD HAVE A YEAR WARANTY FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE. I SENT TO PHONE TO NOKIA FOR TESTING, MAYBE THAT WILL HONOR WARANTY...OTHER THAN BATTERY LIFE, IT A GOOD PHONE"	0
"After having this phone over the 14 day return period,it started running the battery down.I have another one of these phones that I have been using several years.It was new old stock when I bought it and after dropping it several times I broke the housing where the antenna goes.I took the battery out of this one and my new phone ran this battery down.The phone gets real hot when this occurs, like it is shorting out.My current purchase is a refurb.I won&apos;t be doing this again.  I went back to my old phone again.  These are excellent phones when purchased new."	0
After I bought the phone he said he had a 7 day return policy and that he would work with me if it didn&apos;t work out. When I received the phone it wasn&apos;t what it was made out to be and he refused to take the phone back . THis is my last transaction with Ebay and I will never recommend them ever again. Sad to be lied to. Horrible experience and I am stuck with something I don&apos;t want and he wont take back	0
"AFTER I PURCHASED THE PHONE , I HAD METRO PCS ACTIVATE THE PHONE, WELL I COULDENT SEND OR RECEIVE ANY PICTURE MESSAGES OR VIDEO, I HAD TAKEN THE PHONE TO METRO WITHIN A DAY OR SO, AGAIN, METRO CORP, STORE COULD NOT MAKE THE PIC OR VIDEO WORK, I EMAILED THE SELLER AND ASKED FOR FULL REFUND CAUSE METRO PCS SAYS ITS A FACTORY DEFECT PHONE.AND INSIDE PRODUCTION DATE, HAS THIS PHONE OVER 2 YEARS OLD , NO INSTRUCTION BOOK CAME WITH THE PHONE.

"After I received the phone, it did not work properly so I securely packaged it and requested for a return. I did not get a full refund because they claimed I sent the phone with a scratch  on the body?? Do not buy from this seller, this is such a scam."	0
"After I wasted my time tracking the auction, and having won, the seller sent me an email saying that the phone was stolen and it was not for me to make the payment.  "	0
"After just two months function of the article failed,ghost touches of the digitizer. The Display is ok,would not repurchase this item and would not recommend it to others. Is my opinion, everyone must decide it for himself."	0
"After losing my original L90, I bought the new model phone from T-Mobile.  The camera on the new phone does not take close-up photos well and this is a feature I need.  The L90 phone was only available from the internet, but it was in as-new condition and it has worked flawlessly for 3 months."	1
"after nothing but problems with s4, bought the s6.   Never could get this one to boot up right so sent back and bought apple."	0
After one week I may say that this phone satisfy my wishes. The only thing that I don&apos;t like is a protector for USB cable. I can&apos;t open wide to plug the USB cable. I had difficulty in transferring my contacts but finaly I made it.	1
"After owning a couple touchscreen phones and dealing with the screens not responding or accidentally being activated, I wanted an easy to use smartphone with buttons. I did some research and found the blackberry pearl to fit my needs exactly: bar phone, buttons, smaller size, long battery life, and a current model. The phone I won was used, but in excellent condition. I have not had a single problem with the phone in the couple months I have owned it. It (knock on wood) has not frozen yet, it holds its charge for 3 days with a large amount of texting and emailing. When I talk on the phone for an extended period of time, the battery will usually last jut over 2 days. The suretype texting took some getting used to, but I can text faster than I could on the touchscreen phones I owned before. One of the few downsides would be the size of the screen. You have to zoom in a lot to view a webpage and you can only see a small window of the page at one time; however, that is to be expected with a small phone like this.   For a busy college student who treats her phone like an appendage, the pearl does what it needs to without going overboard. I don&apos;t need a million apps or the latest games, just the basic call/text features, email, wifi, and reliability."	1
"After paying for the articles posted seller cancelled the order saying that there was something wrong the address when is not , I received mail and packages to this address normally .. do not recommend   "	0

"after purchasing this phone I contacted Verizon because I could not get my emails.  I was informed from Verizon that the software was no longer used, and that sometime this year,I would no longer be able to make or receive calls because Verizon is doing away with that service as well."	0
"After receiving my phone I tried to have it added to my service (since it was ""unlocked""). But, come to find out it was not unlocked. Huge waste of time and held up my funds for 2 weeks..."	0
After receiving this phone I used it for about a week and I realise a lot of strange numbers coming up in my phone so I took it to and expect and he told me the reason for the numbers is cause the phone was not new and the number or from the person that had it before this is a bad company to buy from and they need to explain to me 	0
"After seeing the phone being sold for, $67, and making my purchase.  I was contacted by the seller saying the price was actually $82.  Very unprofessional."	0
After the auction closed they pulled the item off of eBay	0

"After waiting almost 3 weeks for the phone, the face lens came off with the packaging material.  Phone was sent back at my expense, and now I am waiting for it to be replaced.    Payment for the phone was received on June 25, and today is August 7.  I am still waiting."	0
"After winning the bid, the seller immediately shipped out my package and I received it within the next three days. The I Phone description and accessories were exactly the way they were as described from the user. In addition, when ever I had questions, the user quickly responded to them. In summary, the user provided excellent service."	1

All goos as expected... thanks	1
"All I can say is that you should never buy it from ebay.   Buy it from genuine store you can trust. I screwed up twice with this product.   1st one, never reached to my hand, second one, I was sent by seller factory refurbished product. Chinese letter on it and It looks cheap."	0
"All I saw about this phone was how great the screen is . How nice the camera is etc . Sadly this phone has connectivity issues that make it useless. I've missed more phone call , been unable to make or receive calls or I get  texts 2 days later . VERY DISAPPOINTED in this phone . And the only answer I get is that its hoped it is remedied with the next update ( whenever that might be ) . Avoid this phone . With so many other choices steer clear of this bomb"	0

"all people i have spoke with while using this phone, told me that they don't hear me, it's very unclear."	0
"all questions answered. smooth transaction, and fast shipping, plus great product! i didn&apos;t want the same phone all of my friends had and i stumbled upon the samsung memoir. from the first time i turned it on and transferred the sim card, i have had nothing but fun with this phone. the touch screen, especially during texting, is awesome. i had my reservations about using touch screens because i had tried my friends phone in the past and found that the sensitivity was not all that great, but on this phone, after calibration, i have a change of heart. the touch qwerty keyboard is easy to use and i have had no trouble adjusting from a phone keypad predictive text to a full keyboard. all in all, it takes a little time but not much to get use to it, but as you get to know the phone it&apos;s easy to personalize and use. I highly recommend this phone."	1
All scratched and freezes a lot.	0
All the awesomeness that is an iPhone7	1
"All the right features for what I want and need to do BUT neither one worked, I ordered a second phone after the first did not work and the second phone did not work.  The seller was cooperative and I was pleased with their action.  I just wished the phone(s) worked."	0
"All these years I've heard about iPhones and how great they are, but never had one.  This one was tiny, no faster or more versatile than Androids I have owned.  Can't believe anyone paid over $500 for this when new.  What am I missing?  I paid $90 for this used one in beautiful condition and, after using it for an hour, when back to my LG G3.  The gullibility of the American consumer overwhelms me."	0
All though it came in a brand new box the battery seems to be defective and it doesn't charge the phone and gets extremely hot and that's the whole reason why I bought a new phone was because the other phone's battery was dying all the time so I basically just threw $80 out the window. So I'm not really happy but what ever I guess that's what you get for buying crap online.	0
Alles Perfekt kann mich nicht beklagen Artikel in unschlagbarer Zeit erhalten und einwandfrei wie beschrieben	1

"Alot of sellers of cell phones on ebay, and alot with negative remarks. This one i bought from steevesj  is exactly as described with fast reply and shipping. I researched his sales and his high ebay score stood out among the others. He also replied immediately to my purchase and supplied me with all the info i would need to hook it up effortlessly. Thank you"	1
"Already had one, got the other for a friend who just loved it, I use straight talk for my service and this is a Verizon phone. Great processor speed , excellent camera and photo&apos;s , and I think the stick notes are great too. I even watch Netflix on the phone with no issues at all. I can&apos;t wait to move on up to the new Galaxy phones as the come along. Love eBay too , but almost all I need there."	1
already owned one that got damaged. Needed a replacement. Since I already knew how it worked and liked it I wanted another just like it. The price was right for me.	1
"Als erstes muss man sagen das Nokia 6230 war schon beim Erscheinen seiner Zeit weit vorraus. Es besticht mit seiner relativ kleinen Gre und seiner auf den ersten Blick nicht zu sehender Ausstattung. Dazu kommt noch die Robustheit und die Vielfalt an Zubehr,die es noch immer auch Jahre nach dem Erscheinen zu kaufen gibt.Die Akkulaufzeit ist sehr lang und auf der mitgelieferten Speicherkarte ist genug Platz. Ich merke es kaum wenn ich es zum Joggen mitnehme,und falls mir das Cover nicht gefllt dann schaue ich bei ebay vorbei und bekomm fr wenig Geld ein fast neu aussehendes Handy."	1
Also I can't update my software cause the GSM go locked 	0

Although I just got this phone but had a Huawei 7 . It seems like the look and feel are a tad bit better on the 8 over the 7 . Must say that the 7 still is a very nice phone and will be expecting the 8 to do just as good of an experience .	1
Although iphone 3gs is nice....................................................................aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaassssssssssssddddffghh	0
Although mine was used as a whole I love my iPhone 5s. My battery life is great I can go all day on one charge and I am always doing something on my phone. It's small which is great because I fits in my pocket with no problem but not too small to where I lose it. I love Apple devices to it was no problem syncing it to my lifestyle. 	1
"Although not as powerful as newer models, the Galaxy S5 is still a great phone!  Personally, I like knowing should I ever need to change out my battery, it's a simple procedure, unlike the galaxy s6 or s7. The camera takes sharp clear pictures. And the average selling price on ebay makes this phone a great value."	1
"Although seller seems reputable and has a 100% rating, the phone was sold as &quot;no returns,&quot; and it worked for about a week. This phone was sent to family member out-of-state, this unreliable phone has created a huge problem.  I am disappointed that I cannot even return the phone as it was a &quot;no returns,&quot; item. so, buyer beware, make sure sellers are willing to take &quot;lemons&quot; back."	0
"Although the model has become outdated, it makes a good iTunes device. It does make a good phone but many of the apps I require for work do not work with the iPhone 3GS. It was kind of disappointing but I still use it to listen to music without draining the charge on my real phone."	1
Although the phone came quickly and was as described it did not accept my AT&amp;T sims card.  I have sent 3 emails the seller who advertises that there is a 30 day return postage paid but have not yet heard back as to how to return the phone.  Since he is so highly rated I am hoping that he is on vacation but if I don&apos;t hear from him by Tuesday I will give him a poor review and contact my credit card company about the problem.	0
"although the seal was at one end , everything in the box was as expected . Nice phone at a great value and the gift (this phone) was a hit no complaints from the receiver "	1
"Although this could now be considered an ""older"" model smartphone, it's a very good phone.  We have used this phone for about 4 years.  I dropped mine in the ocean, so I bought another one on ebay to replace it because it's such a good phone.  It does everything.  There may be newer models that are better or faster at this point, but this was the best phone I have owned, so far.  It has good battery life, unless you leave various features turned on.  Then the battery life could be sucked down quickly.  But I have been able to use this phone all day without charging it, if I turn on ""battery saving mode.""  Very easy to use, a lot of storage, and an excellent camera.  "	1
"Although this phone is advertised as a GSM, one has to be savvy as to what they say means--namely limited use in the US. Also, the directions came in Spanish only. I went to Best Buy and got the same phone, for the US this time, at a slightly cheaper cost!"	0
"Although this phone looks new, it has some problems. Some keys on the keyboard don&apos;t work well. They have to be pushed several times before the character comes up. It is very difficult to hear the person you are talking to and I am not able to turn the volume up. Had I known these things before I bid on the phone, I would not have bought it."	0
"Althought I had to buy the charger, the cellphone it works great and usefull. I could change the software 5 to 6, that was great"	1
"Always had Samsung phones, the first they sent was not unlocked, so had to return. Got proper phone, worked for a few days then wouldn't charge, sent it back. They got it to work via their technicians so sent it back. Worked for 2 whole days. Wouldn't charge, couldn't switch it on, returned again. Got only partial refund as I had returned it twice before and according to them it worked NOT.  BEWARE!!"	0
Always make sure you understand the meanings of each abbrev. Because some people take advantage of that.(Eg- ESN)means that you can&apos;t never connect it. That happend t me.     Thanks.	0
Always wanted an android versus iphone. I like the side keyboard. I returned it only because it did not support Arabic Language	1
"am feel happy, fast shipping, item as description, nothing wrong, good seller, I trust in ebay, and will be making deals with ebay in the future. txs"	1
"Am so impressed with this phone. Though the item was used, it is in very good working conditions. Its about a couple of months since the I got it and I don&apos;t have any problems. Only the battery is a bit of a let down but all in all its fantastic. Even though the review is about the phone I must also applaud the seller who shipped it very swiftly."	1
Am waiting for my refund I have  returned this item 	0
Amazing buy it if you can	1
"Amazing eazy intuitive phone! I hesitated to change for the learning curve - but it is simple, and so much more than a phone. I have found no gliches, hangups or any problems at all I love this phone!!!"	1
amazing long lasting battery life!	1
"Amazing phone for the going price; this item has everything you may need in the working world. Includes a keyboard for convenience in addition to the touch screen options that other devices offer. My only complaint is the battery life; it is not the best out there, but this is only a minor setback for a smartphone this powerful."	1
AMAZING PHONE WILL NOT REGRET! AMAZING SELLER!!!!	1
"Amazing phone, but buy it from the OnePlus site. It's 400$ there, direct from the manufacturer. New."	1

"Amazon discontinued production of this item after I purchased and before I received.  I do not have a mobile phone; but, this one had all the features I dreamed of having, especially at the price I paid.   It isn't Android. Is has Amazon operating system and I heard there would be only one update. If you are fond of Amazons Prime product; this is a great little product. Very small screen for viewing unless you can get the prime account to display elsewhere (TV, Tablet, etc.).  Huge drawback: No future. Huge Pro: I read it can be modified to use Google Android (but lose Prime). High tech people could make good use of its many great hardware features ;)"	0
"Amzingly fast phone, love it. Great buy"	1
"An AMAZING PHONE!!! I bought this product after owning the Omnia7 and I must say what a fantastic upgrade. First, the OS is beautiful and after two years of the windows phone OS I still smile with excitement while looking at the start screen, its an amazing notification tool. The OS itself is buttery smooth, no hiccups or freezing with my experience from the three devices that Ive owned (HD7, Omnia 7, and the Focus S). As for the hardware, I was afraid I got ripped off when I received my package but upon opening it I was stunned at how light the phone is, when I let people hold it they are just as stunned. The screen is beautiful with deep inky blacks to die for, however it only has 480x800 resolution like the Galaxy S II but its not bad at all. The battery life is decent, I squeeze about 24hrs out of it with heavy use and with battery saver on without charging overnight I can get about 2 days and 3hrs from it. In order to get the bright whites I had to go to the extra settings and turn auto display intensity off, a fact that concerned me when first playing with it in store. I could compare it to the iPhone but its not an iPhone, I think its best competitor is the Nokia Lumia 900, however the plastic makes the Focus S light and less likely to shatter the display glass. The sound quality is amazing with my Klipsch S4i but I seem to lack bass but does offer a clear even sound all around. The camera is very nice and 720p Video is amazing when shot in direct sunlight. Whats great to have is the 4G, while its not LTE I do get about 3-6mbps here in Chicago.  Im currently running it on Straight Talk using their AT&amp;T compatible sim which gives me unlimited talk, text, and, apparently data as well for only $45 a month. With Straight Talk it took a bit of poking around to get Bing service and my Zune pass working but now that I got it I always stream over 4G with no interruptions. The app selection is decent but I suggest you use AppFlow to discover the best apps, its an amazing why to get the best out of the marketplace. Dont hesitate if you spot a deal on this it is an AMAZING PHONE!!!!"	1
"AN AMAZING VERIZON MESSAGING PHONE!    I had, owned the LG VX5400 prior to owning this wonderful phone. I purchased it because I was in the market for a new device, and my contract was up. I have used many smartphones and QWERTY keyboarded phones, so I decided on another one (even though my last was not a qwerty).     As soon as I got this phone I really thought of the ENV9900. This was my last eNV phone that I had owned, and because of me washing it was left with the 5400. I immediately fell in love with the keyboard, and the amount of messages this can hold is simply amazing as well.     The camera is the best of any 3.2 MP camera I have seen. Because I have had cell phones, my digital camera was only a 3.2 MP (old camera) and I thought it had good shots. I actually resorted to putting it in a drawer and using this for full time imaging and pictures if that tells you something. No issues here. Recommended 100%"	1

An improvement on my old phone. Much more capability and versatility. I like the camera zoom and also the ablity to add storage so now I can play my music and watch movies when I travel and not take a separate camera and mp3 player. Cool	1

An unreliable phone overall. Dropped calls and whatnot. You&apos;re better paying more for a better phone if you expect it to last. This was for my mom who just wanted a simple and basic but reliable phone and she says she hates it.	0

"Androids are the worst phones ever made when it comes to phones. Worst ever. I have had this phone for a couple of weeks now and I hate it. It's junk compared to apple. The only reason I got this was because it's big. Come to find out, it's junk. Once I pay off my iPhone bill, I'm switching back to an iPhone. iPhones are way better quality compared to androids. Everything is better on it compared to androids. You want a good quality phone that will last you long? GET AN IPHONE!!!!"	0

"Apparently, luckycell thinks it's ok to try and sell parts they do not have. Purchased a camera from them for a rush order for a customer. Paid for expedited shipping to get the part quickly. Later that day, luckycell comes back stating they don't have that part and they would get more in at a later date. Frustrated.. I went back to find the part from another vendor, and luckycell still had the listing for the cameras as active and up. "	0
Apple has great customer service I was able to send them a phone that was not recognizing my thumbprint and within three days they received it and set me back a new one.

"Arrived a day early, no issues with the phone. Only downside is it didn't come with a U.S. wall block charger. "	1
Arrived early and appears to be in working order. Son says it works well and doesnt seem to have any issues.	1
"Arrived fine, seller delivered well. No issues there. But the product itself is awful, poorly made, obviously fake and I'm worried about charging it and fire risks and all that. Does say ""Original Nokia"" in the advert description  and is definitely not. Took the battery out and is all fake, sim cover unit is cheap plastic, Nokia sticker is obviously printed and missing logo and correct keypad. For 25 bucks, fine, a but of fun, but it, to my eyes, is sold as an original product and it just isn't.  Front cover fell off when I opened the battery case, has the Nokia operating graphics and screen looks the same but cheap, flimsy plastic. Beware, for 25 bucks, not too fussed but this isn't a real nokia."	0
arrived in great condition and im glad i chose this model. it is not that sofisticated as a smart phone but it is the great combination of simple and smart :)	1
Arrived in original box and well before arrival date. Thank you.	1

"As a new comer to apple I can honestly say I am sorry I waited so long and glad I stared with the SE. It is perfect for what I need.  I have no way of telling you anything other than iSE is a sturdy device with great features and a nice long battery life.  Many say it is too small, but coming from a palm pro and Nokia E71x user, this screen is more than double so I see it as big. My only complaint with apple is, unlike every cell phone I have usedzg where pretty much any sounds could be saved to ringtones, apple is proprietary and disagreeable. I find that unsatisfactory. People should be able to save wav files as ringtones without having to use itunes or buy them in app the forum. "	1
"As a telecommunications engineer, I wanted my aging Father to have a Cellular phone that had large buttons so he would be able to dial for personal calls, but more importantly for emergencies.  The phone looked fantastic and perfect for a senior.  It arrived and is very cheaply made, It claims it was 'unlocked' to all carriers and when I placed the AT&T SIM in  the phone it would not accept it and would only stay in ""Emergency Mode"".  Very disappointed --  Take this advice from a telecommunication expert with 27 years experience -- DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!!!"	0

"As all devices or almost all of them, the galaxy note legacy is still the best (in its type with electronic pencil and other features) smart phone in the market (for me). No complain and not much to say about the Galaxy Note 8, if the people wants a full review go to you tube and go for it. I'm with the family of the galaxy notes, my first smart phone was the note 2 and still I'm with them, no other device from other brand, Samsung is the company which I follow since 10 years ago, and I'm not thinking in change it for others 5 or 10 years."	1

As far as small form factor I have no idea what that meant. The HTC One has a lot of good features but it some small problems. It always shows up ( unfortunately HTC service pack has stopped) You have to update it then uninstall it again. But all in all its a good phone and I have bought 2 of them I bought this one for 130.00 from ultrapageinc in perfect condition. They have 5star ratings in my eyes. Great phone for those who have hearing problems	1
"As it says in the title of the review, this is 100% false advertising! Completely untrustworthy. "	0
"As long as you realize it has limited RAM and isnt intended to run a dozen programs i  the background, this phone is amazing.   It arrived exactly as described, and I was very pleased with the preloaded software."	1
As my last upgrade was stolen I was stuck with an old Soni Ericcson.  When this one arrived people were saying I sounded a bit muffled.  I put this down to DPD chucking it around the van.  I must have been right as its working wonderfully now and is far better than my old phone.  I can use all the applications that I pay for in my 3 contract and think its FAB!  Thanks! Meow_!	1
As of Sept and Oct of 2018 you will not be able to activate these phones through Verizon. I just bought one and had to return it because both the lady at my local Verizon store and a sales rep on verizons help line told me they would no longer activate any 3G or early 4 G phones. 	0
"As of today, May 29, 2007, Seller refuses to send refund.  I paid for shipment both times.  Says I should&apos;ve done more to make the phone work; AT&amp;T technicians couldn&apos;t get it to work.  He is a cheat and a liar.  He said he would refund my money if I sent back the phone. Stop this guy! I&apos;m sure I won&apos;t be the last person he cheats and lies to. The phone was advertised as an AT&amp;T/Cingular phone; but was never intended for that network.  It was a T-Mobile phone."	0
"As professional reviewers have said, a great phone for the money. Activated on T-mobile with no problems. Screen is bright and gorilla glass hard. Screen size is a good compromise between visibility and size. I find the 5"" too small to read easily and the 7"" too bulky. Only minor drawback is that memory is smaller and gets filled quickly with apps (I'm not a huge app user). Even with an SD card you can't transfer most apps to the SD."	1
As promised. Thanks. 	1
"As soon as I get it activated, I will be happy with it. So far, I really like it."	1
"As soon as opening the product, I noticed that the screen had scratches and the plastic had a chip in it. Upon starting it up, the display seemed to be glitch and has forever ran slowly. This phone came in a broken package and I was not satisfied. I do not recommend. "	0
As stated  it was like new. Good price. Very pleased.	1
"As you can see in the first picture, at the bottom of the phone, the phone is supposed to be bezels, its not in that picture. Also, in the first pic as well, theres no notch at the top, and the text on the screen doesnt look like how apples text is. Your selling a fake iPhone in the original box for almost $1000?!? To know if is a real apple product, look up the serial number and track it. "	0
Asked for item to be shipped faster and he helped with getting that done. Recommend this seller. 	1
"Asus Zenfone 2 seems to have a problem of never turning on nor charging, this is a good example of buying a dead phone. Don't bother buying this piece of junk cause I tried everything I could to fix it, shame on you superglobalcentre for not checking your product before you sell it. (In this picture it shows the phone charging but nothing indicates that the phone really is charging)"	0
At first  it was great it worked but after 2 days the screen went black and will not work . U can her sounds but NO picture. Nothing happened on my end I had it in my hand when it happened. But I bought a used product so thats where I made a mistake on my part. Lesson learned 	0
at first i didnt like the phone then after how many times i have droped it and it hasent broke in anyway i have grown to like it and it was cheap	1
At first I purchased the iPhone 7 and was disappointed by its lack of features verses the iPhone 6s. I originally had an iPhone 6 Plus. The 6s was much cheaper and to me was still on par with the iPhone 7 I recently returned. Thanks apple!	1
At first I thought the phone had a power defect because it wouldn't turn on while charging and I didn't see the charging indication screen. I decided to charge it over night and it turned on and got to 100%. The batter lasted a decent amount of hours so the power is fine. The screen was broken (stated in description field) and it had scratches too (also stated in description). Great deal!	1
"At first I thought this was exactly what I&apos;d been looking for--a simple, inexpensive phone with a nice long battery life. Less than a month after purchase, the battery started dying within 24 hours. I have no idea why, but I&apos;m very disappointed."	0
At first it seemed nice untill connecting to wifi. Then constantly losing signal unless literally standing on top of router. And even then extremely slow. 	0

"Awesome phone!    I changed to this from iPhone5s. And I was surprised that how good this phone is.  Ok, it does not work with Apple&apos;s other products and there is lot to work to get use to this Z Ultra.    The main thing why I changed to this is the screen size. I have a big fingers so I had great many times misspellings with small 5s screen when trying to write something.    And the biggest issue I have come up with this is that android does not communicate with Apple&apos;s ecosystems, like at all. At least not properly.    And somehow there is this annoying feature with android. It duplicates all my contacts and I can&apos;t get that corrected. Maybe it is some malfunction on this phone or maybe it is feature that android does have in it.    I have a slight issue with data waveband&apos;s. Phone has 4G LTE. And I have only 3G what I use. But when data transfer is needed it drops straight to 2G as lowest and it so slow. Too slow. I haven&apos;t figured out why so. And also the wifi is slow.    This phone is the international model C6833 and I think the problem is either on settings or that the phone has got some damages on delivery.    And with this issue I&apos;ve had a great help with the seller. They are helping me to resolve the problem! And I&apos;m sure that this issue is going to be resolved fast.    But in general the phone is good to use. It feels good in hand. It is water and dust proved so i don&apos;t have to be so extra careful with it when it starts to rain and stuff like that.  Big screen is awesome. It might feel weird to hold on your ear (I hate bluetooth hands frees because they last only month or so and you need to buy a new one) but it does not matter cause the other features are so awesome with it!    And what comes with hands free I prefer to use those &quot;REAL&quot; car phones that are mounted to car like for good. And I&apos;ll just use call transfer so I get to use brilliant sound quality through my car&apos;s speakers and so on. And at the same time my new Z Ultra can work for me as navigator. SUPER!    I can&apos;t tell is android better or is iPhone better. Both has their own features and qualities and I will be using both of them in the future. Maybe I&apos;ll buy iPhone 6+ or maybe I wait for the S version or the iPhone 7. But that is for sure that I will be using this Z Ultra for a long time as my dailydriver."	1
"awesome phone! I had a galaxy 7 but it couldn't hold a charge for long and kept dropping calls. This phone galaxy 8 is a better upgrade, with louder volume, faster downloads, and a battery life of 12 hours or longer with frequent internet use. I can go all day and most of the night before needing to charge this phone. I was nervous about ordering a phone online but was recommended to use this shop and seller. I have been very impressed with the phone!"	1

Awesome. working perfect.	1
"Awful experience. First, they sent me the wrong phone and made me pay return shipping to send it back. After receiving the correct phone, it was incredibly defective. It would not update to the newest software, it heated up like crazy after minimal use, the battery drained exponentiallly, and most of the times I could not dial out or receive my calls. After filing a complaint, they authorized me to return the phone for a full refund which I did immediately. However, they still have not issued the refund (it&apos;s been 3 weeks) and has not responded to any of my messages. eBay should shut this business down. I would give them 0 stars if I could."	0

"Bad battery; short life; shuts down constantly unless charging.  Many of these phones had the same problems, but were usually solved with the warranty for replacing the battery.  As this is a used item, warranties rarely if not already do not apply anymore.  I'm very disappointed."	0

Bad speaker and microphone. Hard to understand what people are saying. My sister said: sounds like you're talking in a barrell.	0
"Bad things: bad hardware. in one week after purchase loudspeaker gone damage itself (warranty replaced it). after a year display gone damage (not broken) I paid for replacement afterward charging microchip on mother board gone damage (I paid for replacement).

"Basic Android phone that is smaller than the large screen phones for those who need the smaller size. Clear phone connections, pretty easy to use, and with TracFone service, very cheap. Pretty much does what it claims."	1
"Basically just a first gen smart phone,but so simple to get used to,nice screen,keyboard helps if you dont wanna use the touchscreen,camera quality could be better,but talking to anyone on this phone is great and so is the three 3g,would recomment to anyone looking for a simple but nice android phone"	1
"Basically, a family member and his GF upgraded phones and got the android Galaxy S Fascinate. He knows I am into gadgets, and I helped him set it up. I had my iPhone next to me when I was doing the set up, and doing a comparison, I&apos;d say this is Verizon&apos;s iPhone, however I think that the iPhone is still the best out there for AT&amp;T unless I get a different phone and find out otherwise.    PROS:  The phone has a big screen, and has a swipe text feature, which would be you&apos;d start to type a word, it pops up with the suggestions and you swipe through them.    Social Networking, FB and Twitter are easily used on this phone. Amazing for that. I am just used to the iPhone&apos;s FB layout and I&apos;m wondering if the FB layout on this is any different. He doesn&apos;t have an FB so I couldn&apos;t test.    CONS:  A little big of a phone, def bigger then my Jest and iPhone, but you should get used to the size once using    Battery, goes down fast with touchscreen. Overall 4.5 phone"	1
Basiclly it would have been a nice phone. this one was used&amp; the price was reasonable but as it turned out it did not work. the keypad was inop and from the moisture tab in the back it was exposed to moisture. The seller was quite good to refund my money. If the phone was new ithink it would have a good phone	0

Battery life 12+ hours.  Fast processing. Superb camera.  Only objection is the fragility of the screen - so one must get a good case with proper edge protection.	1

be careful advertised as new and oem  .. i dont believe it	0
"Be careful on buying from this seller the phone it's not new. It seems but it's not. When you get the phone, it will have a lot of emails on it from the seller and the front microphone doesn't work such as Siri will not work. "	0
"Be careful when buying these phones. The state that its new and sealed when it actually is NOT...Check the sellers negative feedback and it will be clear if its actually new or not... I received my phone and it looked brand new and was in a sealed box but then i realized.... The phone i purchased was 64GB and the Box said 128GB. Then i opened the box and the phone looked great, definitely looked new until i checked the IMEI number of it to find out that it was previously used for an entire year on a network and is Blocked by the carrier.  What these guys do is buy these phones in Bulk and hack them with a different Firmware to make it work and change the back cover to make it look NEW. THATS IT.. DONT FALL FOR THIS SCAM LIKE I DID. THIS WAS A BIG HASSLE AND A WASTE OF TIME!!! ONE OF THESE SELLERS IS  ""excelic.store"" BE CAREFUL!!!"	0

"	0
Be PREPARED to carry around your charger with this phone as it is only good for about 3.5 hours on a full charge.  	0
"Be warned! I already reported this seller to Ebay after I bought the phone but never received it. Seller posted invalid tracking number and never replied to my messages. Suddenly he/she cancelled the transaction without my request, gave me partial refund and kept the balance. Ebay had to intervene. Again be warned! Dont trust this listing. I hope Ebay will take action against the seller soon."	0

"Beautiful, flawless, activated with no problems and came with charger and charging cable. Was delivered sooner than expected also."	1
"Beautifully designed and solid phone. Best look&amp;feel combination, due to it&apos;s thickness feels awesome in the hand. Let&apos;s not forget the water-resistance and the battery-save mode. After using several Xperia models I even found it&apos;s software being more stable compared to Samsung S2/S3. Well done Sony!"	1

Before I bought this phone the specks said unlocked when I got it it wasn't unlocked. Then like a week later all of a sudden the screen is freaking out where you can barely see anything on it. Only a bunch of lines and half of the screen is black with line running through them. I really regret buying this phone.	0
"Before I purchased this item it said on its description that this was an unlocked phone, however when I received it and installed my own SIM card from a different carrier other than Verizon the phone not only it doen't recognize the SIM but it will not work at all.   contacted the seller and they tell me that the phone is locked to the Verizon network and it will no work with any other network that is not of what their network is.  Very dissapointed! "	0

"Besides being heavy and large, the phone is practically useless.  Set it up and went on a short trip.  The phone had to be redone to roam.  Airplane mode keeps coming on and has to be reset to work.  I transferred the years service and minutes to my old tracfone and am selling the Cymbal on Ebay.  Disappointing!"	0
"Besides the fact that the phone looks good, it has terrible service and the battery does not last at all.  Used it for a couple of days, but with such poor service, I could never call on it and it would take forever to send or receive a text, so quit using it.  Will only use a motorola or LG phone from now on."	0

"Best of the last Smartphones with replaceable Batteries. So much better to have a couple of genuine OEM batteries on hand on your trip when you can't find a place to plug in your charger. Newer phones all have built-in batteries that require you buy a bulky non OEM external battery or a Bulky battery case like a MofiPak or other. Good for WiFi calling and as a Mobile HotSpot, too."	1
"Best phone EVAR! Sure the cloud serivces are shut down, and in order to use it you must goto forums.webosnation.com and read up a bit, but it&apos;s such a wonderful user experience that it&apos;s totally worth it! buy one, use it, and shutup!"	1

Best phone ever...	1
"Best phone for me so far, beautiful pictures. outstanding performance. The LG G3s design is a safe one that wont polarise opinion as much as the dimpled back of the Galaxy S5 does, but at the same time wont gain the plaudits of the solid and refined metal HTC One M8. And while LG has managed to keep the G3 as trim as possible for a phone with a 5.5-inch screen it is still a very big phone. If youre used to sub-5-inch phones we recommend you go in store and try it before buying, particularly if youre planning to add a case for protection."	1

If you are looking for a smartphone that is capable of internet surfing, taking care of your Ebay business, and getting you from one location to the next while messaging your friends and talking at the same time, this is the phone! I highly recommend the Samsung Note II to everyone and I promise you will not be disappointed!"	1

"Best Touch Phone under $400(with out contract), Fully customizable-easy to use touch screen interface (Android 2.1), has a qwerty slide out keyboard ,has a 5 mega pixel camera with flash which is awesome. The best part is that it has the same processor as the IPHONE 3G which makes the my touch 3g slide SUPER FAST, Big difference in the speed if you upgraded for the t-mobile g1 like I did. The only problem is battery life, but you can fix that if you buy the 1750mah DROID ERIS BATTERY by SEIDIO, you can actually find the battery on ebay that&apos;s how I got my battery. So overall very good phone, just buy that 1750mah battery from SEIDIO and the phone is perfect. YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!"	1

Blackberry Bold is a very good phone. I have been using touch screen smart phones for a few years now. I finally got the urge to try the Bold and I cant say enough about it.

"Both phones were defective and had to be return. My only concern is that the return was at me, other wise i got back my money."	0
Bottom speakers on phone didn't work when we got it. Had to take it to Apple Store to replace phone. Real bummer since it said it was in perfect condition and we paid so much.	0

"Bought a first one for a friend and when I saw that it was presentable I bought a second one but when I started the phone I was disappointed with the characteristics and performance. Poor image quality, small storage capacity, slow, etc. All it has is a good presentation "	0
Bought a iPhone 5c and the seller changed his seller notes after I paid for the phone and will not refund me my money. He knew it was iCloud locked and it wasn't in his notes until after I received the phone and said something to him. 	0
Bought a NEW Satin Pink RAZR.  It came with the language set to Italian. HAd an old version of the firmware. The battery wouldn&apos;t hold a charge.  The paint started to rub off of the phone in several places.  Within 4 weeks the display hinge pin fell out.  The sell refuses to do anything.  In my opinion this phone was a refurbished phone and was not using genuine Motorola parts.	0
"Bought a Panasonic GD55 that was supposedly factory refurbished to &quot;new&quot; condition. I wanted a small tri-band GSM phone to take with me to Europe. The phone was unacceptable. The battery pack would not latch on and fell off the phone.  The plug-in connection for the battery charger did not work.  The LCD screen was dim and blurry.   The phone was returned to seller for a refund. As this was a refurbished product, my experience might not be a fair review of a new GD55. Reviews I read prior to my purchase were very positive."	0
Bought a phone from this person. Then they reported it stolen!!!	0
"Bought a phone, great in Every way. Seller is fast shipper. No problems."	1
"Bought a used blue/silver vx8560 more than a year ago for my daughter &amp; it performed very well. Now I use it (got her a Samsung Brightside at AmazonWireless for $0.01 hehe) and have been pleased with the features. The mp3 player is nifty, I like the &apos;phone-closed&apos; operability, the Bluetooth connectivity, the SDHC card memory, and the look. Also have fun with animated gifs on BOTH screens. The camera is low-res but color is true and you can adjust exposure with a side-button, and zoom with the dial-wheel quite easily. I found a deal on the extended battery and back cover for that too &amp; while it&apos;s a bit bulkier, the battery life is GREAT! All in all an attractive, useful and inexpensive phone for them not on a data plan."	1
"Bought an iPhone from this seller a few months ago and there was a bright spot on the screen which he told me about before I bought the phone I just took it to the Apple Store because my Siri couldn't here me, turns out the phone was water damaged and the screen had been replaced so they couldn't fix it and I had to buy a new phone. Waste of my money "	0
Bought and paid for it! And never recieved it! I escalated it to a claim and then E-Bay realized that the seller was a Crook and then E-Bay to the side of the seller and closed the the case! Thanks E-Bay	0
bought as a spare have had one for three years and it  is a very dependable phone not a lot of frills but excellent for my needs	1
Bought as new but turned out to be used.	0
Bought because of Google tango but had mixed feelings because of the reviews. I like large phones for business as i a camera installer and like a big screen. I can also demo products easy with the large view. Had specs similar to the new note 8 but better camera pixles. Anyway here is a real honest review from someone that buys allot of phones and not getting paid to trash other brands. The phab 2 pro doesn't really seem much bigger than the note 8. Fits nice in my jeans and pocket. I love when people ask what kind of phone I'm using really cool to show them tango. Anyways to make a long story short the screen is amazing colors are not a sharp as they are on some of the Samsung or apple but really after while you don't notice it it takes super sharp amazing photos the daytime but forget about taking them at night. The photos are not greedy at night you just can't see them very well I'm sure if you got them Photoshop you can make look really good but again we all know we take tons of photos on our phone but never really look at them to who cares lol but I can tell you the daytime pictures or absolutely fabulous. The Dolby surround town and playing music its incredible you actually think it's from a small desktop stereo and games sound amazing so would I  buy this phone again ? abs	1
Bought for a friend in Jamaica and he loves it. Make sure it&apos;s protected so that it lasts ans protect the screen.	1

Bought it cause he didn&apos;t up the phone price! It was an easy transaction! The phone came just as it was described in his listing. I would buy from him again. Also love that he leaves feed back when I paid. Makes me feel better knowing that it was really just that easy!!!!	1
Bought it for mainly emergencies-and when I travel-It is junk-the battery cover wouldn`t fit right-tried several batteries-won`t hold a charge-no on or off button that is clear-garbled sound-turns itself off and on-icons are not clear-only good thing is the battery display	0
"Bought it for my mom and she loves it, perfect condition A+++++"	1
Bought it for my son.  He LOVES his new phone.  It was an upgrade from an old phone that wasn&apos;t a smartphone.  He says it&apos;s very similar to an iPhone.	1

"Bought it on a whim,and wasn't disappointed. Went from a galaxy S5 to this phone and was surprised at the speed,graphics,and response. Battery life is way above average. "	1
Bought it to replace my original same model that I broke the screen on.  Total cost was about 1/2 what I gave for the original at Walmart and if it is not new I could not tell the difference.	1
Bought less than a month. Not working anymore 	0
Bought my exclaim directly from sprint about a year ago. During that year it froze constantly despite several firmware updates and hard resets by Sprint. After about a year the device stopped charging and began constantly rebooting. I purchased another exclaim on Ebay along with 2 brand new Samsung OEM batteries and device came rebooting similar to my original. I took both devices to a Sprint repair location and they agreed that both devices were defective. I looked up problem online and found that many others have the same problem I have with their Exclaim. A friend of mine has a new Samsung phone with many problems as well including constant freezing. It seems that Samsung make attractive innovative products but clearly the quality leaves something to be desired. I will certainly think twice before buying a Samsung phone again.	0
"bought Nokia for my good lady wife because it is nice to look at different, and easy to use.Priced right and nor too big for her bag."	1
"Bought one for my son for Christmas. It arrived in perfect condition & if it was used before, you couldn't tell. So my son got the phone he wanted & in like new condition for a great price. Will definitely buy from the seller again. Very happy with the phone! ! Works perfectly. "	1
"Bought one pixel phone in August 2018 that was dead in January 2019 = 5 months  bad buy in my case.  Bought a second pixel they are cheap 200. Thought the first one was just a lemon.

Bought phone. Took phone to Sprint to get added on to account but phone is apparently no good. The IMEI ICCID is not authenticated. 	0
"Bought the &quot;NEW&quot; phone and found it &quot;refurbished&quot; it is not new.  Seller was polite, but sadly the phone did not work after a day and it did not arrive on the early shipping I had paid for.  Had to pay and return the faulty phone $20 and waited for a new one for an even longer time.  Ended up spending twice as much to buy and return it."	0
"Bought the LG G4 around 2 month ago to my wife, she was not happy for long,  the phone just died! went to a phone store for reparation to fix it, the day after they said it was the processor that was broken meaning that you can through the phone in the garbage grrrrr.. 153 $ plus shipment 40$to Ecuador, strait in the toilet for nothing, am pissed, start to be to many problems, lot of problems and crap through ebay now..i want a refund or a new phone, No more then right!"	0
"bought the NewPhone and was immediately impressed with the number of features available on this inexpensive phone. It has a 1M-pixel camera, video camera, and speakerphone. The NewPhone&apos;s size is perfect for carrying in a pocket and the battery has a pretty good lifespan of roughly 4 hours. My only complaint is that the menu system on the phone makes you click four times before you can find someone in the address book, set an alarm, or perform a additional functions. Other phones I&apos;ve owned have simpler menus and get you to important features easily. Overall, I&apos;d recommend the phone if you&apos;re on a budget."	1
"Bought the phone about 15 days ago for a gift. Acted dumb by never actually trying to make a call or to call it, now that its activated I found out that the sound on it doesn't work at all...."	0
Bought the phone at an awesome price.  They delivered it quickly! The phone works great and looks brand new!	1
Bought the phone for a elderly friend in a nursing home. Phone was unable to turn on at times but when finally on there were only black lines all down the screen with some black marks down the sides. Screen was not attached to phone as it came off easily. No charger for phone. Per seller she would not return the money as her description said no accessories and that some damage to screen. Had to buy another phone for the friend. Waste of my money.	0
"Bought the phone for my wife as a gift for Mothers Day. She loves it. Works just as advertised. When on one line, someone can call the other number and they can leave a voice message.  The Wifi works well. No issues with slow memory so far."	1

"Bought this a little over a month ago based on good reviews and Samsung&apos;s reputation.  I must have got a lemon because it performs very poorly. It was good for maybe a week.  Blank screen for hours at a time.  We&apos;ve tried to be patient and give it time, then got busy and  I waited too - can&apos;t return.  $80 down the drain. Very confusing to contact the seller, so I have to leave this review."	0

Bought this cell phone and the first red flag was moto-lenovo cell phone. Oh boy! Motorola sold there soul on this one. Bad blinking flashing and restarting and off then would not correct after factory reset back to the same blinking and flashing. Only lasted out of the box about 3 hrs. 7.0 os android with a mixture of badly overstated performance. LOL just flat out to screwy to work with. I own an old moto-x that works great. Not this model my next cell phone will be LG why take a chance on all this handed around add this and that to a junk phone and call it Motorola when it is not. Lenovo what the hell that ever is.	0

Bought this iphone only to find out it doesnt charge when it was listed in perfect working condition. Then I go to contact the seller to work something out and they simply ignored my messages. This is ridiculous there's fraudulent scam artists are still able to sell on here. If your buying anything from this seller better make sure that it isn't electronic because they can't seem to tell how to properly post things or correct their mistake...instead your met with pointless dialogue in ebay messages only for them to ignore you in the end	0
Bought this item from the red cell. It came in great condition without a scratch on screen and just one small imperfection/scrpae on upper left corner one metal. It was under 300.00 which was perfect for my budget!! Thanks! Red cell!! Fast shipping! Great product!!	1

"Bought this phone for my 16-year-old's birthday. He's had it 3 months now. No glitches or gimmicks - we got exactly what was advertised. The phone is in excellent condition, and he loves it. This is a great way to save money buying a couple of generations back from the newest version. Perfect for a teenager. The wider, rounded screen suits him, because he likes to play games and watch videos on his phone. We are super-safisfied with this purchase!"	1

Bought this phone for my husband. He is not a smart phone man. This phone is light weight and has the features of the new and old. The screen in bigger than most flips. The key pad is larger than most also and he loves that. Very easy to use. I have no complaints about this phone. Very nice.	1

"Bought this phone from this seller and paid a little extra because of the stuffs in the bundle. Phone looks okay but the VR viewer came in broken. Sent an email to the seller but he wouldn't respond. At the end of the day, I paid more for this bundle when I could have purchased only the phone elsewhere for a much lesser price during Black Friday."	0
"Bought this phone in good faith for one of my young children as a starter phone, my daughter was very excited about the prospect of her first mobile telephone.I paid for the item by sending a cheque and waited.......some time later I received an e mail requesting my address, I replied with said details and then waited some more.Some time later I contacted the seller.....no reply.I contacted the seller again when my cheque for the item had been cashed....no reply. The seller then cancelled his e bay registration and is probably spending my money on topping up my mobile phone.    Amazon.co.uk....you are my new best friend."	0
"Bought this phone on Ebay was suppose to be &quot;new&quot; when I got the phone it had someone&apos;s text messages and phone numbers. Contacted seller about the misrepresentation and got a partial refund. The external screen doesn&apos;t work and none of the electric chargers work.  Other than this, the phone is great. This is the second V8 that I&apos;ve had that wouldn&apos;t charge with electric charger."	0

"Bought this to replace my old Ericsson, had no trouble with it until the keyboard starting acting up."	1
"Bought this to use with Straight Talk. Transferred service from another Straight Talk phone. The phone service transferred but not the 4G LTE service. Phone would only connect to Internet via Wi-Fi. Went though  numerous steps to try to connect with LTE service including rebooting/resetting the software but to no avail.  Discovered that some screens on the phone are not the same as a stock s5. Some widgets are missing as well such as the Mobile Data widget. This is either a software-defective phone or a knockoff/fake. In either case, the phone is useless and is being returned. "	0
"Bought this used to replace one with a cracked screen. Unfortunately the battery was weak n doesn't hold a charge for long. But the old phones battery is still holding a charge all day long. So as the used phone goes it works brilliantly, the battery wasn't in good condition maybe poor ( well used ). Fortunately swapped batteries so good to go."	1
bought to use with cingular area.  doesnot support the frequency any more.  cingular upgrades made this phone useless.  sits on my shelf only as t- mobile cannot use it even. make sure your area supports it and cingular is not going to do away with this frequency soon in your area.  nikia is a good clear cell phone but this model is obsolite.	0

"Brand new in box, but battery life is terrible, 10% every hour in sleep mode. Very slow mobile network connection even when in open area. I have to use speakerphone 90 of the time, due to difficulty and not clear on the on the other line. Bad investment. Not recommended. "	0

"Brand new w490 love it. I bought the w490 motorola weeks ago and was immediately impressed with the number of features available on this inexpensive phone. It has a 1.3-pixel camera, video camera, and speakerphone. The NewPhone&apos;s size is perfect for carrying in a pocket and the battery has a pretty good lifespan of roughly 4 hours."	1
"Bright screen, everything works and works well, beautiful design."	1
"Brilliant phone. Beats the iphone hands down in my personal opinion. 4.3 &quot; screen is a dream and touch screen is super fast and very responsive. Is unlocked so can use it with any SIM in the future too. No hassles. HTC sense is simply superb and lays very well over WinMobile. My partner has a HTC hero and and we both are in love with the HTC sense. Battery is replaceable unlike iphone. Micro SD card can be upgraded unlike iphone, FM radio built in (sorry iphone users !). Very happy to have waited a got this. To summarize, it has Everything and more you could ever ask for from a smart phone. Highly recommended. This is THE iphone killer, in my opinion !!"	1
Broke my old phone so I got this as a replacemnet. It has all the basic funtctions along with the camera. Simple to use and to enter all your old settings.	1
"Broke within the first week - screen went out, sim card kept slipping, sound went out, etc.  My seller was great and let me exchange it for a different phone, so I&apos;m happy about that.  However, not one single thing made me happy about this phone."	0

"Brought unlocked phone and was unable to use it. Was told that I could pay $20 to get it unlocked. When I refused to pay it, I was told to to go to my phone provider to get it unlocked.

"bullshit.. no charger included, cannot use. junk will never buy from this person again. Poor communication. overall bad seller"	0
BUt i tgot lost i the mail. SO I don't know much about it.	0
Buttons are broken including the enter button how tf am i supposed to text man thats why i bought it. Waiste of money now i gotta buy another. Items wasnt as described wasted 70 bucks.	0
Buttons you can see!  Buttons large enough that your finger only hits one at a time!  Menus that don't get in the way until you need them.  A ringer that you can hear and that sounds like a telephone not a passing circus. An effective way to control butt-dialing. By far the best man human factors design I have seen in a cell phone. Unneeded features are largely eliminated. Almost good enough to double as a 1950s phone from Maq Bell!  A phone for the elder end of the generation gap!	1

Buyer  beware. I bought this phone after reading the description believing it had voice recognition. After realizing it didn't I asked for RA they sent me a label and I sent the phone back not noting tracking #. They claimed they never received the phone I received no refund. 	0
"---------------------------------BUYER BEWARE -------------------- -------------    I got this phone for my birthday from my boyfriend last March. I have not even had the phone a year yet and I have major issues with it. Two months after I got the phone it started locking up, I would have to take the battery out and put it back and restart the phone. Then about 3 months ago my phone started with a new problem - incoming calls would not register, I would check my phone and it would say I had a voicemail but no missed calls. I can not upgrade my software properly and two weeks ago I started having problem with callers not being able to hear me.     All of these problems are typical of HTC phones. It usually take a year before the phone starts freezing and the microphone goes out but in some case (such as mine) it happens in 8 months. BUYER BEWARE once you have had the phone for 6 months HTC will not fix it. A repair ship tried to charge me $100 to fix the microphone alone."	0
Buyer beware your order not expect what you get	0
Buyer beware!!! This seller is a fraud. Item was shipped and no tracking provided. Tracking later provided but item was shipped to himself. Item was never received. Asked for money back.	0
"Buyer beware. Yes, it does have an Android operating system. No, you can not download any apps. Email is locked to the local carrier. Not a great option for use in North America. It was unlocked and had to translate the Japanese to change the menus to English. About 30% remains in Japanese even with language set to English. Seller was amazing and phone was otherwise exactly as described. Just very overpriced for what amounts to (in North America) a very basic flip phone."	0
Buyer cancelled the purchase after I won and paid!	0
"Buyer is a SCHAM artist! He was all nice and helpful up until he received payment (which was imediate I may add)...then...NO item and most definately NO responce.                             STAY AWAY !!!     eBay SHOULD take action against these kind of low lifes and close their accounts AT ONCE, preventing them from making any further transactions.  I&apos;m deeply dissapoint that this is still an &apos;open case&apos; after nearly 2 weeks!    Once again...this is a CLEAR warning to STAY AWAY from this seller and do NOT get schammed into buying ANYTHING of value like I have.                              STAY AWAY !!!"	0
Buyer stated it is unlocked and will not respond to messages!	0
Buyera be aware! This is a 100% fake Samsung Galaxy S10+. Don't make the same mistake I made	0
"Buyers beware! The phone I purchased does not have a clean IMEI. According to T-Mobil, there is $485.00 balance due on the phone and I was told that I was responsible for the payment to T-Mobil. I was told if I don't start paying for it,  phone will be blocked within 2 months. I recommend you all check on the IMEI to make sure there is no balance on it."	0
"Buying a 3GS in 2019 is about as useless as spending money on a lotto ticket. The chances of this being a useful device is almost at .000001 percent. The device OS is no longer updatable, the hardware malfunctioning, and the battery completely depleted. Even modularly repairing this is a waste of anyones time. The only reason to purchase this is to enjoy the nostalgia factor of browsing through the ancient OS or merely for gimmicks.  Regardless, I bought the phone as a joke to a friend for Christmas, and unfortunately the device sent to me had a swelling battery. I fully expected this phone not to work properly, I also expected it to be in bad condition. What I DIDNT expect is the seller sent it with a swelling battery, lifting display and excessively bulging rear and did not label the package with a lithium contents label... This was practically a mini bomb."	0
by far the best phone i love the phone it has great features plus 5megapixels camera and walkie talkie is awsome best phone boost mobile has to offer i am so happy with the phone features the slim design but also heavy duty makes it even better	1
By owe means it is not the sellers fault. The phones lag shut off reboots and just a poor setup for a phone would not recommend for anyone.	0
"C&apos;est compliqu pour moi puisque je suis en conflit bavec le vendeur!  Je vous explique brievement, j&apos;ai donc achet le tlphone et en l&apos;espace de 3 mois il est tomb en panne 2 fois et depuis le vendeur fait le mort......."	0
Call volume is extremely low. I have to use speaker phone just to be able to hear the person. 	0
"Calls go directly to voicemail.  Screen turns purple periodically. Functions operate very slowly. I can&apos;t use my home key. I have to use my &quot;back&quot; button to back completely out of all of the apps in order to get back to the home screen. All of my contacts don&apos;t show up. AND to top it off, I received NO RESPONSE FROM THE SELLER when I made a contact attempt! This smartphone is not so smart."	0

"Came from a moto x 3rd gen. I don't mind the smaller screen for a more rugged phone. Battery life is great, it only uses battery when the screen is on for me, not a lot of background stuff or handles it well. Plays stuff like myboy gba great. Been very happy with the upgrade. "	1

"came very fast,,, good sellers"	1
Came with an Otter Box case mint(thought it was new) and the phone doesn't have a scratch. Out of all the buys I've done on eBay definitely top notch all around. The extara batteries were a plus. Definitely a huge value purchase. Thanks a lot. 	1

Also the games I purchased did not come up on new phone. Phone lacks some things but the seller got me the phone in record time. No issues with the seller just withTracFone and LG."	0
cant take any pictures with it   and the battery does not last long other than that its great	0
Can't use it with the cell phone towers in Tennessee. So before buy a phone on EBay for Straight talk you better check to made sure it is compatible with towers in your State 	0
Can't use the phone with T-Mobile since it is locked for use by Consumer Cellular.  When I bought it I failed to notice it was locked.  Not the seller's fault.  Buyer beware.	0

Case closed... eBay refunded my purchase money.... after I opened a case and then escalated it. This seller is a fraud. We won a bid and paid immediately (thank God we used PayPal). Never received our purchased item. Seller never communicated with us... until after the money was refunded. Our money was tied up from January 28 until February 18.   Thank you eBay for your integrity and good customer service. Too bad this seller does not have these qualities.  Future Bidders: beware of sellers like this one. Chances are this seller will move to open a different eBay account and start over with fresh ratings. Be careful out there.	0

"Changing the screen together with LCD cost me 152! Furthermore, It does not 'function as intended': only the phone works, the data network does not work. Finally, the battery does not hold long. On the whole, it was not a good deal since it cost much less new!! "	0

"Clean IMEI? Yes, It took me go thru initialization/setup procedures as documented in vendor site.    No, this is not an unlocked phone.  I should insert my SIM as I received it. But I just check everything, and spent a week to downloaded maps and tailor every apps I have with my old Nokia.  When I insert my SIM, it displayed &quot;LOCKED&quot; and another message prompted me that I have ten times to enter unlock code. Too bad, I&apos;ve already given positive feedback to this seller.    I know how to unlock it, but this is a matter of trust.  How can I buy again from this seller if I cannot trust what I read?"	0
"Clearly not the original phone so trying to resolve the problems has been difficult.The buttons constantly lock, or worse just will not work, no matter how hard or how many times you hit the same button. Restarting it does nothing. Battery life is less then 24 hours. The phone is set to English but a number of things are either in Spanish or French. Was hoping for a durable simple oldschool phone (the one I had in my highschool years) but this has been more of a hassle and waste of money. went back to using my other phone."	0

"Coming from a Samsung Intercept on virgin mobile this phone is amazing.  The colors look very crisp and clear, the camera takes great pictures and the screen actually appears to be a tiny bit bigger than a 3.2 compared to other 3.2 screens I&apos;ve saw (samsung intercept).  The battery life is great I manage to get through a whole day using it as a mp3 player, texting, web use, and calling and still have a half a battery at the end of the day.  However, I do miss having a keyboard but after using the phone for a good week I&apos;m much faster with swype than with my physical keyboard on the Samsung Intercept."	1
CommentsThis was supposed to be a Virgin Mobile CUSTOM phone but it s not. The service for this phone is by some OLD company called ZACT. I had to do research and find out about them online. They went out of business in 2014 and the phone CAN T BE ACTIVATED! I need a refund for this phone and paid shipping to send it back.	0

"Costing half as much as the Pixel and Pixel 2, the Nexus 5x does everything well in working as a Project Fi phone.  So sorry that they've discontinued it as a Google offering, for I prefer its smaller size and weight to the others.

In Wirklichkeit handelt es sich um ein Handy welches Simlock auf den US Anbieter Sprint  hat und somit in Europa gar nicht nutzbar ist. Ich kann nur jedem raten, sich  k e i n  iPhone is USA zu kaufen. Dass das  Handy ein Simlock hat, wurde vom Anbieter nicht verschwiegen!  Ich fhle mich ber den Tisch gezogen"	0
Das Handy hat ein sehr ansprechendes Design. Zustzlich ist es kompatibel zur Freisprecheinrichtung HKW-720.     Die Bedienung ist sehr einfach (wie von Siemens gewohnt). Durch den Mechanismus zum ffnen und Schlieen ideal fr die Damenhandtasche. Meine Frau ist jedenfalls begeistert ;-)	1
"das Handy ist vom Preis/Leistungsverhltnis einmalig, Verarbeitung sieht sehr edel aus, nicht biegsam (Metallchassis), Silikonhlle im Lieferumfang, alle Apps arbeiten bei mir sehr schnell..

"Dear 2011powersales,    I received the phone but I was surprised it does not work. The battery is old, the phone is used. He has loaded a previous user&apos;s agenda and photos. I can not run. You cheated me, and I&apos;m going to advertise in all media. I had been sold as new. And est date back a huge disappointment. I have no more money to buy another phone, and this is good for absolutely nothing. They&apos;re gangsters! Send another cell that does not function. Motherfuckers!"	0

decide to buy it cause i need a durable phone that can take a licking and same time.when buying good customer service and right on time delivery	1
"decided to buy this mobile phone because it is more practical, easy to use, and was at a good price. is a phone that has already been shown to give good service, good sign"	1
"Decided to upgrade from my iPhone 5c to something a bit bigger with more RAM, storage, and a better camera. It's very fast and smooth. Very user friendly once you hey used to it. It's the perfect size too, larger screen but not oversized and pretty comfortable for your hand. Definitely worth trying out if you're looking to upgrade."	1
Decision to buy phone was the price very good price.  Unfortunatley the phone freezes alot I have to turn the phone off and then back on for phone to start functioning right and is not working proerly when texting the letter typed always inputs the incorect letter causing bad texts.  Item was described as NEW and is REFURBISHED and I could not buy insurance on phone at the local cricket store.  Now I have to purchase another phone because it is defective.  won&apos;t ever buy another phone from this seller.	0
deep scratches on the screen. bad back panel.	0
"Defected phone ,  doesnt work properly, when you return it. They cut off some money from your refund. I dont recommend buying from this seller"	0
"Defective iPhone! It randomly turns off about three times/day. Only sometimes does it connect to cellular data (and the problem is not on Verizons side). The seller offered for me to send back the iPhone and, once received, theyll mail replacement. Then I dont have a phone for work, though! The other option was for me to buy another, wait to receive, then send the original back for refund. Money would be in limbo a couple weeks that way. Not happy!"	0
Defective phones the are t-mobile unlocked and not factory unlocked 	0
Definitely a pleasure doing business with and professional!	1
Definitely an improvement in battery over the 6. Great phone	1
"Definitely not worth the $200 I spent on this skuffed up piece of shit. And the pics on the listing was fake. Some of the pics shows a white phone & they also shows a newer condition phone, but they sent me a beat up phone. The frame of the phone is heavily worn out, the cases that came with it should be in the garbage, the screen appears to have some kind of hard glue stuck to the bottom of the screen. I'm sorry E-bay I have to say I am sticking with Amazon when it comes to online shopping. Never order from this guy ever"	0
"DEFINITELY worth the purchase!!!  The 6 Plus is the best of both worlds.  Yes, the size is larger!  That is what I was missing by not having a Samsung Galaxy (which is what I owned before going to the Iphone 5S), now, I have the amazing size, with the AWESOME Apple service.  I couldn&apos;t be happier.  BTW, my husband got the 6, it&apos;s a little smaller than the Plus, but the features are just the same, both are amazing phones and we feel the phone is a great value.  We sold our perfect condition Iphone 5S phones and put the profit from them toward this purchase!  Take care of your Iphones!  They keep their value and make purchasing the new Iphones a little more affordable!  As expected, the upgrades seem to only get better and better!  Very happy customer!"	1
Deliver Time and quality of item on high level. Thank to seller.	1
"Delivered in great shape, works excellent and it was delivered fast. I have purchased cell phones from different ebay stores and this is by far the best, really professional store."	1

"Depending on how much you use your phone, if you use it all day like any other phone, the battery will be low.  But works as it should!  I couldn't download anything from the app store, so i cleared the search history, factory reset, and restart the phone a few times until I can download apps!  Cosmetically, the phone was excellent.  And it came with a charger!"	1

"Design/Build:   The major issues with this two-fold: 1) it feels cheap so youre really just waiting for it to break on you, and 2) it takes a second for it to actually flip, so you get this weird sense of delay. Its kind of cool pressing the side button; but it gets old.   The data port and charge ports are both on the top of the phone which may be a problem if you are in the habit of charging while talking on the phone. The keys are smooth, flat, and mirrored.  This is going to be a matter of opinion between people, but I personally like buttons that give you some sense of feedback and there simply was none here.  It was also put together very poorly as you could see light leaking out around every seam in the plastic.  Software/Functions:   The phone itself seemed sluggish, and many keys didnt respond without being pushed a couple times.  It found my Bluetooth headset with very little effort, and connected to it very well.   Calls were very quiet and had a scratchy feel to them, though this was solved through use of a headset, so I suspect it was the onboard speaker.  Calls also had an odd habit of not going where you wanted them too.  For instance, while calling my mother, I was connected to Mexico.  Every time!  It seems Nokia automatically assumes you are dialing an international number, and is expecting your country code first.  Since I didnt program my contacts as 1 (area code) number, and instead simply (area code) number, none of my calls or texts worked.   I use my phones primarily for business, and as such, I make great use of the mute button when on conference calls.  Now, Nokia forgot to put one on this phone.  While on a call, you can go to options, scroll down to mute, and the call is muted.  By the way, those key tones your phone is making are also playing into your call.  Not cool.  When its your turn to speak and you wish to unmute your line, youre better off just hanging up and calling back.  Where the Mute option was is now an option to put it into speaker phone (still muted) or to the handset (also still muted).  After a few failed conference calls, I found the unmute option . . . at the bottom of another menu entirely.   There is no key lock on this phone; none. Side keys can be activated at any time.  This means you get to delete pics of the inside of your pocket a lot, and occasionally you will find that your phone has been turned off.   The camera responded quickly (1.3MP) and the phone features Pict-Bridge so you can link it directly to a printer to get your pics off and onto paper. On top of that, whatever image processor Nokia threw into this thing has issues with color and lighting   This phone does feature a nifty little tool in its radio application.  With a special headset (included in my package) you can tune through FM stations and save and name your favorites.  The stations are then browsable through a button on the headphones, or the arrow keys on the phone.  The tuner is a decent quality and the headphones were loud and clear.  This was almost a solid good point for the phone . . . almost.   When switching between stations, the display doesnt update.  Though youve changed stations 12 or so times, it still says you are on your first station.  In order to actually see what station you are on, you have to open the phone, go through 4 menus, and reopen the radio app (which technically never closed in the first place).  It also eats battery power like popcorn.    Only 1 star is enough."	0
"Despite not being made of metal make no mistake this is a quality phone with a just brilliant back screen. If you like me use an e-reader this phone saves me carting around two devices. If you also use this screen for an always on watch for  messages and tell the time, you will find the battery lasts ages. The software is very classy as is everything about this handset. One drawback is there isn't many cases that you can get that allow you full use of both screens and, keep it safe if drops as it is a little slippy. A total bargain now the company have dropped its price. Get one and impress yourself and your friends.   "	1

Dislike it because on label said brand new but it was really already opened. nothing looked brand new about this phone. Phone is alright but booklet is torned and looked really old. have a feeling it is a fake phone. the booklet only has about 30 pages but in the content said more than 100 pages. I bought this because I liked the phone only. Not to mention the at home charger is broken. Only the car charger works. IF I wouldve known this phone was in an not good condition I would not buy it. Seller is overall very poor.	0

"Do not buy from here. I ordered this item on 05/28, and because Im leaving out of country, I need this phone ASAP. I contacted the merchant to see if they can sent this phone with faster shipping service and Ill pay for the cost. The merchant rejected and telling me they will only ship with economic shipping which is the slowest shipping service in US. Im totally fine with at least usps first class, but only economic? Seriously? And I cannot pay to have it ship it faster? Ok, aside from the slow shipping service, it took them a week to shipped out the item. I ordered on 05/28, the item was just shipped out today 06/05. I dont know why it took so long for them just to ship out a phone with slowest shipping services. If they ship out the item 1-2 days after I ordered it, then I should able to get it on time and I dont really care what shipping service they use. I felt like Im purchasing an item from overseas. Now Im pretty sure Im wont be able to get this phone on time before I leave. Worst service ever!!! Wasted all my time!! again, dont buy anything here!"	0
Do NOT buy from seller PhoneStoreUSA. They are not new phones. They are bad knockoffs with fake accessories. I was sent two of them. Both fake. Beware. The screen bleeds and blurs when you touch it. The infrared light never turns off on the front of the phone. The phone has trouble turning on and turns off all the time. It didn't come with headphones. The battery is a knockoff. The charger is a knockoff and doesn't even look authentic. Everything about this phone is garbage. I returned it for a replacement. And the replacement had the same issues.

DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER! DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!     This was my first time buying from this seller/ebay. it&apos;s very discouraging and disappointing to be robed your very first experience buying from ebay!! I purchased a sph-a940 cell phone as a gift for my sister from this buyer and she could not have the phone activated. after being told that the phone could not be activated i immediatly contacted the seller. my first message to the seller was...      11/9/06 HELLO FIX4YOU! I RECENTLY PURCHASED THE SPH-A940 CELLPHONE FROM YOU AND IT WORKS GREAT HOWEVER I CALLED SPRINT TO ACTIVE THE PHONE AND THEY TOLD ME I COULDN T BECAUSE THE ESN WASN T CLEAN. THEY SAID THAT SOMEONE HAS REPORTED THE CELLPHONE IN LOST OR STOLEN AND AND BECAUSE OF THAT I CANNOT HAVE THIS CELLPHONE ACTIVATED AND THAT I SHOULD CONTACT YOU TO RESOLVE THIS MATTER. PLEASE GET BACK WITH ME ASAP. the seller messaged me back and said this...    11/9/06 &quot;I purchase these phones in lots of 100. The reason I put the ESN number in my auctions is so you can verify that they can be activated. I am sorry but auction also states that all sales are final, sold as is&quot; I replied the seller message and said this...    11/10/06 &quot;Before I purchased the phone I ask you if the esn was clear and u told me it was and the phone was ready to be activated. I also asked if there where any scratches on the phone/lcd screens. do you remember? I would never purchase a phone that I cannot activate, that dont make any since.&quot; the seller never respond back to that message!!!!!!    It also states in the auction that &quot; A test call was made&quot; how is that possible whan the esn was not clean????? which is a bunch of bull $h!t. now i&apos;m stuck with a cell phone that does not work. now I&apos;m scared to buy from ebay or any other seller again!

"Do not buy this phone! Ever! It&apos;s been just over a year since I&apos;ve had it and have already had it replaced about 3 months ago and I already am having problems with this new one. I have restored my factory settings I don&apos;t know how many times. It freezes on me, when I&apos;m on a call and need to use the dial pad the screen will sometimes go black and it will take me several times before I can bring the call back on to the screen to access the dial pad. Sometimes I have to actually remove the battery to turn it off b/c I can pull up the screen. When people send me picture messages more often than not I will have to turn off then back on before I can see the image. If I don&apos;t I receive an error message saying it&apos;s downloading and to try again later. How much freaking later do I have to wait. I wanted to find out: guess what? it took till the next day to get that image without turning it off first. This phone sucks. You suck LG. There are better phones out there. Don&apos;t do it!"	0
"Do not buy this phone, I received this phone and when i went to use it i found it made this buzzing sound everytime u touched buttons. Also this phone did not work with pic messages or web. I paid $75 for this plus $10 to spend the junk back to recieve a new one and guess what? This one does the exact same thing. I bought this phone bc i needed a cheaper cricket phone because i just got off maternity leave and didnt have alot of money to spend but needed a phone since i had a newborn at home. This phone is back in the box just sitting on my table and im stuck with it since it cant be refunded! Spend the little extra on a nicer phone, this is a waste of money and time!!!"	0

"Do not order from this seller!  I paid for guaranteed delivery to have this in time for a meeting. The item was not late just 1 day, not just 2 days, it was actually 4 days late on a 2-3 day promised delivery. I paid $21.99 EXTRA for this guarantee. When I contacted the seller they refused to return the item that I didn't need since it was not delivered on time. They also refused to refund my shipping charges. Debating with them was a total waste of time as they did not speak very good English and just kept sending the same response refusing the return and offering like $10 in store credit... Again, I paid an EXTRA $21.99 for the shipping. The seller probably got a shipping refund and yet still refused to refund it to me.  I emailed them back and forth at least 12 times and it was a complete waste of time.   If you want any kind of customer service, a product that works, or a product on time, then do NOT order from this seller."	0

The battery is terrible and I could not get anyone to replace the battery because they said this phone is known for its malfunctioning battery.

"Don&apos;t be put off by the 600Mhz, this phone rocks! It has a built-in graphics processor (GPU) that enables it to function like the big boys. As an example, it has no problem playing Angry Birds, unlike some more expensive Android phones. At first I was leery about the no keyboard (my previous phone had a physical keyboard), but now I see that as a feature. It is so light, so portable, and yet it feels sturdy in your hand. Using the built-in SWYPE technology, you will have no problem using the on-screen keyboard. Also, 150MB of user-storage sounds small, but combined with the 512MB of RAM, and the ability to move many applications to the storage card (a feature of Android 2.2), this is plenty of storage. This phone even has a built-in hotspot capability. While this feature is currently hidden by Virgin Mobile, it&apos;s nice to know it&apos;s there in case they decide to provide a plan that supports it. All in all, go buy this phone! Combined with the inexpensive phone plans of Virgin Mobile, this is a great entry point into the world of very powerful SmartPhones. Get it NOW!"	1
"Don&apos;t buy from this seller-He will make it sound that he is working with you and in the end will rip you off.Sent me two bad phones and then promised to refund my money, and then I never heard a reply back from him, nor did I reeceive my promised refund from him. Communicates with you that he will do anything for you and then will ignore you and take your money, and never communicate with you again, even after repeated attemps.

Don't be fooled by the hype for smaller bezels and bigger screens. What really matters is the usability of the phone	1
"Don't believe seller claims that their used or refurbished Verizon Note8 phones are unlocked and work on any GSM networks - that is only partially true. The truth is that Verizon customizes the internal chip programming (ROM) of their phones, and you can't change it into generic condition by resetting the phone, or changing network and APN configurations. Unless you do an advanced technique of flashing the ROM (vendors don't do that), the phone will always be locked into Verizon's proprietary techniques for: - System updates - Splash screen on startup - Settings menu - Functionality like WIFI calling A Verizon Note8 has been Verizonized, and their modifications are problematic on other networks. Perhaps the worst problem for those trying to use a Verizonized Note8 on T-Mobile's network, is that you can lose the ability to make or receive calls in lighter coverage areas (much more than an equivalent non-Verizonized phone). I only found all this out the hard way, after a great many support calls with T-Mobile and testing multiple purchased devices. Save yourself the huge problems I had - check before buying, and only buy an unlocked phone that has not been Verizonized."	0

"Don't buy this phone. It worked well for 90 days then it becomes unusable. It locks up and can't even be turned off. It ghost types if you try to send text messages. Don't even try to make a call or answer one. Click a contact to call and another contact randomly is called. Apps open randomly and you can't shut them down. Call Motorola for tech support and instead of them acknowledging that there is a problem they're aware of with the phone , No. This is what happens you spend a couple of hours on the phone deleting apps and wind-up loosing data. Then your left with a phone that is set to the phone defaults as it was when new. Then the tells you to send them the phone. Can anyone go without a phone for 4-6 weeks while Moto trust to make a repair. Your left basically with having to buy a new phone. If you google these problems you'll find  this is a problem the phone has had since it was introduced. It is a problem caused by 3rd party cheep Chinese hardware and bad Moto firmware. It's a Hacker's Dream. If it was possible I would rate the phone a negative 10 (-10)."	0

"Dont waste your phone money of the iPhone if you dont have to. This phone is over hype, I dont see anything big about the iPhone. Ive seen cheaper phone that offer better features than the iPhone. Phone call log sucks it only show all calls and miss calls; you cant select any other type of calls like business only, friends, and what not. Sadly to download apps you are force to become a member. Only good thing is the 4S Siri. Siri come in handy a lot. When watching video, the video does NOT fit into the screen, its too small when you zoom in it cuts out half the video base on the video format. My co-work samsung galaxy s3 is better when watching video. iPhone picture quality sucks, my basic Motorola Rizr Z3 takes great better picture than the iPhone. Also you cant change the camera/video mode, like set it for night shot or day shots, indoor shots. you have to download other camera apps for this. In my opinion is it worth $400 use? Hell No, $200 to $250 yes, $300tops yes, your just buying the name for an extra $100 to $200. Other than that, its the apps that make the phone better and does the same thing other smartphone does. It has a great design."	0

"Don't waste your time with this phone. It looks great & that's all. Most of the time, lost signal, display tweaked-out, keys didn't work, the 911 button is in the worst spot, many times it magiclly called 911. Recess the button somewhere else.     If a Flip-phone is your bag, go to Motorola RAZR  V3 series &  V3i & beyond. Very reliable for the most part, not perfect but I've gone thru 3 in the many years now gone but you can get them refurbished, that show's it's reliability a decade after they were made!"	0

I used it during a costruction job that i managed and it performed great. clear bright screen, nice size fonts when browsing the net, clear speaker, Stereo bluetooth that works with my external speaker. Extended battery lasts 8 hours of talk time or 6 days of standby. Also this phone can take the BT61 battery from motorola, without getting special cover. the BT61 can last over 6 hours of talk time much better than a 4 1/2 hours of the BT51. Ori@InteriorArt.com"	1

"Ebay has everything on the internet when you seach an item that you wanted. The thing I don&apos;t like the most is the feedback.

Edited after a week. phone is advertised as dual sim. it is not dual sim as it is the American model with only one time I number. now it has a slot for dual sim... but not active.  it doesn't cost anymore to get the dual Sim version. a great choice for construction Personnel. It has some great features and he thermal imaging paid for the phone on the first job I used it on. It is no bigger then your standard Samsung with an OtterBox it has a little more weight but nothing more than you would expect for a phone with so many features. I have broken 12 phones to date this year just from having them in day today use on my job site. At $600 this is a no-brainer	1

"Es imposible pagar ni con ebay ni con paypal, porque lo mas seguro es que no tienen configurado la cuenta con paypal por lo cual al no recibir pago no despachan, ademas comprar fuera, en su supuesta ""tienda"" te estaria dejando sin la proteccin de ebay contra fraudes, que no llegue el producto o con respecto a las devoluciones.  ademas me parece demasiado bsica su supuesta tienda online y por qu deberan de poner de entrada, si no puedes pagar con ebay visita nuestra tienda? acaso ya saben que eso va a pasar?"	0

"Es wurden die gestellten Fragen flott beantwortet. Die Schwierigkeiten beim Versand, seitens DHL, hat der Verkufer bestens geregelt. Auch waren die Versandkosten angemessen. Versenden bedeutet Arbeit, wobei ich denke, dass einige Verkufer hier arg berziehen. Bei kleinpreisigen Angeboten ein rgernis und oft fr mich ein Grund nicht zu bieten. In meinem Fall stimmte  alles! Es wird immer schnell gemeckert, wo es ntig ist, ist es in Ordnung. Hier hatte ich einen super Verkufer. Wnsche anderen auch solches Glck. Hab auch schon die Kehrseite kennengelernt."	1

"Even though the memory is expandable, the onboard memory is so small it cannot handle even 1 app download before it starts to ask to delete files without letting up.  Item as described, but the memory is ridiculous and renders the phone practically useless.  Also, it does not use a micro sim, it uses a standard sim.  "	0
"Even though the subject title stated Gold, the phone is actually Silver with a gold plated case. Other than that, everything is good."	1
"Even though this phone has been discontinued, you can still find it free with new contracts. The phone takes great pictures, great mp3 sound, and has upgradeable memory. The down fall of this phone is that the circuit board for the keypad buttons is very sensitive to water and easily damaged. However the phone is easily repaired with the proper screwdriver and parts are readily available on ebay from other phones or resellers. I have repaired mine and resold parts on ebay several times."	1
"Even though this phone was said to be unlocked, we could not get it to work with a new sim card.  Seller did allow us to return it and did refund our money - less shipping - so we paid shipping both ways.  Seller was quick to respond to emails."	0
Ever since I got this phone I have had nothing but problems. I have gone through 3 home chargers and 2 batteries and I have barely had this phone for 8 months. Sometimes the phone wouldn&apos;t even ring. It wouldn&apos;t keep a charge and powered off after 2 hrs.	0

"Everyone in my family has a Galaxy SIII. For under $100 you get a lot of features. I find that it is pretty durable too. If you buy one, do order an external battery charger and an extra battery or two as well. One battery gets me about 1 hours. RAther than put the phone on a charger, I swap batteries. It is also a good idea to have a charger for your car, especially if you are using GPS mapping."	1

"Everyone tells you unlocked  phones will work with other carriers, it has been nothing but a headache. Purchased phone to use with T-Mobile called T-Mobile before I purchased phone, they said there would be no problems, after I signed up for there service have had nothing but problems with there 4g service, went back to there store and they said since it is an unlocked phone you are not going to get the same speed as a T-Mobile phone. I feel I was lied to by T-mobile just so I would sign up. Very disappointed with T-mobile,also I have had a lot of dropped calls"	0
"Everything about it was good,it just didn&apos;t workout for me because i needed one that was unlocked, but that&apos;s my fault, other than that it was good, but then again i had it for a short period of time, but did sell it to a friend who sells iPhone&apos;s at his store and he hasn&apos;t gotten a problem!"	1

"Everything on the phone was perfect - no scratches on the screen, only very minor ones around it.   The problem was that the facial recognition would not work, no matter how many times I tried to do it. It kept saying Lower your camera and would not detect my face no matter what.  I ended up having to return it and get a refund for my purchase. I am disappointed, because the phone itself was in almost perfect condition. "	0

"excellentI bought the NewPhone 74205 three weeks ago and was immediately impressed with the number of features available on this inexpensive phone. It has a 1M-pixel camera, video camera, and speakerphone. The NewPhone&apos;s size is perfect for carrying in a pocket and the battery has a pretty good lifespan of roughly 4 hours. My only complaint is that the menu system on the phone makes you click four times before you can find someone in the address book, set an alarm, or perform a additional functions. Other phones I&apos;ve owned have simpler menus and get you to important features easily. Overall, I&apos;d recommend the phone if you&apos;re on a budget."	1

"expensive for BBerry , sound and earphone are very very bad"	0
extremely difficult to figure out and it is so new no one knows anything to help you with this item.  I was very disapointed had been so looking forward to it. I guess i goofed in not doing my reasearch before i bid on it.    I even took it to 2 of the big phone stores and no one there knew anything to help me a few dollars lost maybe will teach me a lesson	0
"Extremely fast shipping just a few days after order, like new"	1
Extremely long lasting battery sturdy build good screen and fast	1
Extremely slow. It`s like waiting for dial up for something to come up on the screen. Lots of quirks. Doesn't run some apps. I think its designed to be used in a foreign country and not really compatible for U.S. use.	0
Fabulous value and plenty fast. Memory card up to 128G and replaceable battery.   Drop protection and waterproof. WOW!	1
"Factory and provider bloat wear drive me crazy; burn all my onboard memory, slow the phone down, make it more confusing to use and I don't use 90% of it plus you cant delete it...  This phone is: light, fast, and easy to use plus I have the benefit of using the sweet root only apps and customizing it further.  This note 4 is in excellent condition including an immaculate screen, has an OEM stylus, and the battery has very respectable life.  It is exactly what I wanted and I couldn't be happier!"	1
Failed just out of the 30 day warranty from the seller and he wouldn't do anything at all. He just said it was out of warranty.   I has been a 'MAJOR' problem to get it fixed from the only Sony repair station in Canada. I would not recommend buying a Sony phone as they have zero repair stations in the USA and it has been gone 30 days now and not sure when I will see it back yet. Would definitely not buy it again.	0

Fantastic flagship phone. The new features are practical and amazing. I especially love the iris scan unlock feature since it works a lot faster than I expected.  The Note 8 is an excellent phone for anyone on the go with a lot of business to take care of. Being able to scribble notes on the screen without unlocking the phone is a God send! Really happy with my purchase!	1
"Fantastic little standard flip phone. Great features , nice speaker phone and very well built. The bad part it wouldn't work properly in my 2014 Ford Escape with Ford MyTouch. Incoming calls kept disconnecting. My old Convoy 1 works fine but something in the series 3 didn't jive. It could have been just the one I had, maybe another would have worked. but it is a great phone."	1

"FedEx like kidnapped my phone charging me US 106 more when it was arriving, I paid 32 bucks by shipping charges but I expected the entry taxes that normally is the 30% of the price but the charged again another shipping and I ended paying another phone, THIS IS NOT FAIR. Anyway the article is fine, nothing to say about it, totally compatible with Chilean networks "	0
"Few days ago i bought Apple iphone 3GS. Its amazing phone! There are thousand of games and programs are easy to install on it. 3gs has impressive speed, and a lot of games ,which just flying on it! I loved this phone from the first time i see it! 3gs is very easy and functional phone. Fantastic design and perfect proportions of 3gs are leaving behind all competitors. I guess this is the best phone ever made (After iphone 4))"	1
"Fido just launched the Samsung Galaxy Q, and now Videotron has joined in releasing it as well. The Galaxy Q is an entry-level Android handset that has a sliding QWERTY keyboard, and features a 3.2 (320 x 480) touch screen display. It comes with a 3.15 MP camera with LED flash, and runs Android 2.3 Gingerbread. Connectivity options are as expected, with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and GPS, and the handset comes in black."	1
"Finally made the switch from iPhone to Android and the Pixel was a great starting point! I was able to transfer most of my settings, apps and content (pics, text messages etc.) effortlessly. Also, the camera on this phone is OUTSTANDING.. It has a lens blur functionality which outperforms the iPhone Portrait any day of the week. Plus, battery life is great and charges from 0% to 100% in about 2 hours (compared to 5-6 hrs for the iPhone).  This phone is awesome, please use it to kill your iPhone habit and step away from the dark side! :p"	1
"Finally! A prepaid phone carrier with a phone that is worth taking the time to write a review about. Virgin Mobile is by far the best choice for prepaid cell phone carreirs. Here, you can switch from unlimited one month to 200 minutes the next, without paying any hidden costs. The Virgin Mobile Arc is equipped for Bluetooth and has a camera that is of fair quality. What makes things better is that their online services set up your phone with an account that is similar to Photobucket. Now that is cool."	1
"fine product, good buy"	1
Finished the coment about cell phone	1
"first and foremost, the sync has great reception. it is just a little bigger than the razr. the inner screen can be seen in direct sunlight. the lcd is big, for those of us who don&apos;t see as well as we used to. keys are big and good for fat fingers. key are easy to text on, very smooth action. takes a great pic with its 2 megapixel camera, it&apos;s the best i have seen. video recorder, mp3, you can even download a mp3 cutter and edit songs for ringtones and transfer to your phone. although thin, it is tougher tan a two dollar steak. i have owned many good phones and this is my favorite. i don&apos;t like pda&apos;s or touchscreens as they are too complicated or too fragile. don&apos;t get me wrong, the samsung sync has every modern feature you can imagine for those of us who have a life outside our cellphone."	1
"First apple phone, long set up as expected.  Purchased it to sync with the Omron blood pressure and new EKG device.  Downloaded the app and did the sync no problem.  "	1
"First day of use the screen became verticaly inverted, even after a master reset, and many screen/pen calibrations. To many people with this same issue, and the mngf won&apos;t support the problem with the phone. DON&apos;T BUY CECT, OR SCIPHONE!!!  Junk.   You&apos;ll get what you pay for!"	0
"First i had problems with the item color! at ebay it says white lg cookie, but then i recievd a e-mail from the seller telling me the color he had was black NOT white. That was okay with me after all..! But guess what...the item NEVER arrived I try to contact the seller several times by e-mail but he NEVER wrote back..!!"	0
"First i had to pay when i picked it up at the post office,  what i pay for shipping in bid for... then its mission everything,  charger,styles, battery wont charge. Phone is nasty Ni"	0
"First I would like to start off in saying, this phone is a great one. If you arent picky about a few minute things, you will have no problems. The pictures have awesome clarity, it has perty good reception for having an internal antenna, and it has alot of nice features on the broad scale. Although, it is missing some minute features that the 8100 supports, and the 8100 is what i would consider its twin. Such as, In the text messaging i have found no way to get the entry mode called &quot;Word&quot; to learn new words (such as lol, haha, names of people and places, ect...) so whatever is in the phone you are stuck with, and its very frustrating having to switch to &quot;Abc&quot;. If anyone knows a way to change this, please let me know how to teach my phone new words. You also cannot look at your text messages from the outside of the phone, it just says, text message recieved, and you have to open the phone to view the message, again, im being picky, and again if anyone knows how to change this, please let me know how. Other than those small things, the phone is great for the every day user, or for the person who is a little more technologically advanced."	1
First it was not unlocked second it was blacklisted that's pretty much it everything else was good	0
"First of all I got the phone because it looked nice. But after recieving the phone, and seeing the condition it was in I was pissed. And on top of all that the phone did not work. I took it to Verizon Wireless and they told me that the inside of the phone was no good and that I needed to get a new phone. So I got ripped of for 120.00 dollars, and this is not the first time I have been ripped off on ebay. Its the third time. I have contacted ebay on every occasion and have had no response. So as far as I care, EBAY CAN KISS MY ASS I WILL NEVER USE IT AGAIN."	0
"FIRST Of all i was surprised when my nokia arrived, it was configured to greek language. in good condition, very good battery as i&apos;m forgetting when it was the last time i&apos;ve charged it. it was in good price and good packaging.   happy new year 2011. !!!"	1
"FIRST OF ALL IT SAYS GREEN AND WAS WHITE  DIDN&apos;T WORK BUT HAD IT REPAIRED FOR 120.00 BAD SCREEN BUT THEN IT IS NOT USEABLE BECAUSE IT IS A STOLEN IPHONE.. i CONTACTED APPLE AND THE PHONE IS A PAPERWEIGHT BECAUSE WE CAN NOT CONTACT PREVIOUS OWNER TO UNLOCK LOST CODE FROM FIND MY PHONE THE PHONE.I CANT ACTIVATE IT AND WOULD LIKE ALL MONIES REFUNDED PURCHASE PRICE, SCREEN, REPLACEMENT, AND LABOR,  TO REPLACE SCREEN, THANKS JAMIE 9072679634"	0
"FIRST OF ALL THE PHONE ARRIVED WITH PHONE NUMBERS AND VOICE RECORDINGS LEFT BY THE PREVIOUS OWNER..I SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF TIME DELETING ALL OF THEIR STUFF!  THAT IS NOT COOL SELLER!!!!    SECONDLY THE BACK OF THE PHONE FELL OFF EVERYTIME IT WAS PICKED UP.  A VERY BAD BUY ON MY END. BUYING CELL PHONES FROM EBAY IS A BAD IDEA.  I HAVE BOUGHT 3 SO FAR AND THEY WERE ALL WITH FAULTS. MY STUPIDITY FOR  BUYING THE 2ND AND THEN A 3RD, DUH."	0
First of all the phone is poorly build and the software on the phone sucks and kind of slow but for a regular phone it works perfect and I must say the price was not that bad at all I bought a couple for my friends and they were impress by the looks of it . Over all all the phone is pretty ok for an alternate phone to have	1
First of all the phone was stuck at the T-mobile screen at start up. It comes with a cheap Chinese charger and no head phones. The shipping was so delayed by 2 weeks! 	0
"First of all this is a terrible seller he has never reply back to my email, second the earpiece from the speaker doesn&apos;t work and third it has all the application lock with her email address so we will have to unlock it again and pay for it. TERRIBLE SELLER AND ITEM."	0
first of all this isnt even the phone i purchased. i bought a white &quot;new&quot; sII and it was the biggest waste of money I have ever spent. this was a scam the seller is refurbishing phones and selling them as new. the box arrived all tore up with all the phone information ripped off the box and i was told it was shipped from the manufacturer in this condition. bull. I recieved no paperwork or reciept with the phone to prove it was the one i purchased. the phone was defective upon opening the box and neither ebay nor the seller would do anything for me so i basically threw 250 dollars in the trash. it cost extra money and time to send the phone to the manufacturer to have it repaired and the seller said i was wasting there time brining my issues to them even though they were the ones who took my money and wouldnt back there defective product. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER you might be stuck in a similar situation. I cant believe ebay continues to do business this way and allows such unprofessional conduct.	0
First of all this review will probably be best suited to help other first time smart phone owners like myself. The Nokia Lumia 521 is geared toward budget buyers like myself. That however doesn&apos;t mean that it is severely lacking. It has a bright and easily readable screen and videos are clear and a pleasure to watch. It has 8gb of internal memory and a micro SD card slot located in the battery compartment for expanded memory. You have to buy one as it does not come with one but they can be had relatively cheaply. It reaches speeds up to 4G which is excellent for a lower budget phone. It has windows 8 mobile version which I personally really like as it is quite easy to learn and if you have a desktop or laptop at home that has windows 8 then you can sync your accounts and share your files across both devices with Skydrive and MSN. The phone is a good size not- to heavy and also not flimsy. The back is removable and that is where you will find the battery which is replaceable and a big advantage over phones that can&apos;t be taken apart. In the time I have used the phone I haven&apos;t had any problems with battery life it&apos;s been pretty good. The sound is very acceptable as well. I enjoy listening to pandora and sports talk radio with my phone.What really attracted me to the phone was the prepaid option. I use the $30.00 dollar a month prepaid plan that gives me 100 minutes of talk unlimited text and unlimited data and 4G speeds for thirty bucks. No other provider comes close in a pre paid that I could find. There are other plans with more talk minutes if you prefer them but they cost a little more. I also love the bluetooth capabilities of the phone as I use it hands free through my bluetooth capabale car stereo which keeps me from endangering myself and others while driving and keeps me from breaking the law. The camera is very capable but lacks a flash led and would probably therefore not be the best in low light situations but still takes decent pics in normal light. The one major drawback with the phone is no front facing camera for skype or video chats.Also another issue for some will be that windows mobile does not have as many apps as android or ios but it does have plenty of them in the windows store and alot of them are free. Keep in mind I am a first time user and my review reflects that. Would I recommend this phone to a friend? Definitely as long as TMobile has good reception where you will be using it. Go to their site and make sure of the coverage before buying though. Hope this review helps someone. Godblees	1
"First of all, I did not want this product.  I cancelled within 8 minutes that I ordered it, and it took 16 days for me to get a refund from the seller.  I will never do business with this company."	0
"First of all, I want to say that I made this purchase for friend who avoids using the internet as much as possible. I do it frequently and don't mind helping him out. He had dropped his phone and broken the screen and did not want to deal with Verizon getting a replacement. He wanted the same phone, because he was familiar with it and wanted to avoid learning new phone. I checked Amazon and eBay for replacement, with eBay having a larger selection of new and used phones. I skipped bid items and decided on this one, even though it was not the lowest price, but, because the seller is in phone repair biz and pictures and description showed used phone in very good condition. Also, seller was in Alabama and I'm next door in Georgia, so, as long as order is processed quickly, would be delivered in couple of days, which it was. Phone had very little visible defects and was factory reset. Removed SIM card from broken phone, went through setup and had phone up and working quickly, My friend was very happy with phone and has had no problems with phone. "	1
"first of all, i would like to thank the seller he was answering all my inquiries, he is the best  the product was as described, i loved my new phone  thank you so much seller, you're the best"	1
"First of all, it wasn&apos;t a T-Mobile phone, it was a Verizon, which is totally useless to me. Also, the on/off switch was defective, didn&apos;t spring back. The person that sold me this phone is a total rip-off. How she got a 100% satisfaction rating is beyond me. I hope I can get compensated somehow for this transaction. DO NOT buy from this rip-off artist."	0
"First of all. it did not work in our area because it&apos;s not dual band.  Then, the on &amp; off button on top was VERY hard to push.  It seems to be a very outdated phone.  I couldn&apos;t use it at all."	0
"first off I love that phone, but it was stated to be Nextel also.  That is not possible, per Sprint.  It is a sprint only phone.  Nextel does not do palm phones at all.  There are too many people showing these phones as Nextel and they ARE NOT.  I sent it back seller was very prompt in refunding monies and I would shop from them again.  They have in the past had good items that I have purchased.  Just not say they are Nextel phones when they are NOT."	1
"First off it indicated that it's a sprint phone, it's not. Second the seller told me it's iCloud unlocked. It's locked. "	0
First off the battery lif is terrible. Second of all the hole where u plug up the charger is the same hole where u plug up the headset so u cant talk on the phone and have it charging at the same time. If the charger pluggged up the phone thinks its a headset so u cant use it. the same thing with the blue tooh. ohU cant use any kind of ring tones for the text messagesing alo  u can do on this phone is tell it to vibrate when u get a text. phone i sjuts all the way dumb	0
First off the phone back piece to the battery kept breaking. Then the battery aftercare 1 month would not hold a charge. Completely disappointing phone! Do not buy!	0
First off this is my first touch screen phone and im getting used to it. was a little difficult to adjust to but maybe that just me. but other than that it runs just like a computer and i love that start menu and everything. its super fast and it very well done. over all i give it a 5 out of 5. its different and i like it. The only thing i haven&apos;t figured out and maybe its not possible is to send picture messages to a phone number i can only send to an email? But oh well. E bay opened the opportunity to own this phone my phone company (centennial aka att now) only had the diamond 1 and i didnt like and they wanted 550 for it well i found the diamond 2 and fell in love with the looks and got an unlocked one for 180! i was very pleased. All in All its a great phone. Buy it.	1

first three days were good.  i now own a phone that cost more to fix than i paid for it.    it was operational for maybe a week and then the keys on the keeboard (texting ) side began to fail quickly.  no return or repair satisfaction and i don&apos;t have the phone back from the declined repair facility yet.

"First time I ever saw this phone was in cell phone shop I did like the way it look, slide and the 2Mpixel camera that the phone has.    First few days I did like it after one week of using it the power ON and Off stop working, I thought the phone has one year warranty from Nokia and that is what the guy in the shop told me I did contact Nokia and what they told me is this: NokiaUSA does NOT carry this phone it&apos;s overseas phone from different country and we can take it you will need to send it back where you bought it from originally,  I went back to the store and the manager offer me to fix it and I had no other choice soo he took it and it took more than two weeks to get it back it was working fine , Three days later start missing up again when I slide the phone the screen show up side down I took it back there fixed it again and this time it took over one month got it start using it same thing over and over took it back to the store and the manager decide to give me a new one in the box I did open the box got the phone out change the SIM card try to power up the phone did not work the phone had the same problem too   lol    advise, in case that you still want to buy this phone Nokia 6270 make sure that the seller offer some kind of warranty do not depend in Nokia that would not help."	0

"First, a little background, for perspective: I&apos;m an ex-iphone user, migrated from iphone to Android a few years ago, for the freedom and open-ness of the OS. I&apos;ve really liked the Android OS and the phones I&apos;ve bought along the way. A few months ago I bought a Lumia 521 with a new Metro PCS account. The Lumia 521 introduced me to Windows 8 Phone OS and I was amazed at how fluid, intuitive and FUN it is - so I decided to fork out for a premium Windows Phone ... which is what brought me to the Lumia 820.    The NOKIA LUMIA 820 is SOLID. It&apos;s heavy in the hand and has a stable, durable feel to it. The display is vibrant and beautiful. Reviewers and &quot;experts&quot; out there on the web can say anything they want about resolution, rag on the pixel density, whatever - but this phone, in your hand is BEAUTIFUL. Colors pop, photos are crisp and videos look great!    As was the case with my (brief) experience on the Lumia 521, this is quick, nimble, FAST. Every operation is there when called for, tasks present themselves immediately and close just as quickly. There&apos;s something about this Windows OS that must be much less resource-intensive, less hungry than other mobile OS&apos;s, because things just pop and fly all over the place.    The Tiles ... live tiles, that represent what feels like a living, breathing OS Interface. You see the faces of your contacts and friends rotating in and out of the &quot;People&quot; tile ... Facebook posts of friends &quot;pop up&quot; in live time, as they are happening ... News updates circulate in a tile, the tile suddenly flips over to reveal another breaking headline ... the tile from your Songza app suddenly flips over to say &quot;It is Friday Night&quot; (or late Saturday morning, etc.) ... the Photos tile rotates through your albums, scrolling slowly and continuously ... nothing stands still, this tiled-interface is alive!    More on Tiles ... you can size and re-size your tiles, according to taste; regular (square), large (rectangle that covers width of the screen) or small (one quarter size of regular). You can even Pin your favorite websites to the screen, each in a tile of it&apos;s own. I&apos;ve got four favorite Playlists (from Nokia Music) pinned to my screen, each re-sized to small, and they form a little music &quot;block&quot;, the size of a regular tile!    The Lumia 820 has NFC capability and Wireless Charging - something I didn&apos;t think I&apos;d ever need or use, but I did fork out for the charging plate and it&apos;s been a very nice bonus. I&apos;ve already grown lazy, with the ability to simply place the phone on it&apos;s back for a charge ... no plugs, cables or hassles.    CUSTOMIZATION! Unlike other phones in the Lumia lineup, this one has interchangeable back plates. Once in place, it looks like a solid piece of polycarbonate. You can make this a Cyan phone, a bright Red phone, Yellow, White or Black, simply by putting a different (removable) back plate on it. You can order these with or without NFC and Wireless Charging capability. This phone was black when I bought it, I&apos;ve since changed it to Cyan (and have other colors on order).    Is the 920 a better phone? How about the 928? Well, the specs are better on those phones, but for me, this is the sweet spot. It&apos;s smaller than the 920, but with the same screen size, and (again), with the joy of body / color customization. Processing speed? System RAM? What are those??? What do I care? When a phone is as fast, fluid, stable and zippy as this is, who cares? When you get a phone that performs as beautifully as this, you can forg"	1

For 100 more dollars I could by a iPhone 7	0
for a cheap smart phone its worth it to get you by until you can afford to get a better one and the battery life is awesome but you can only download one app on the phone at a time due to the low internal memory and cannot put apps onto the memory card unless you root the phone which is illegal to do	0
"For a kid start out with the ten minutes and let them use it up!  Then buy the year after they get used to the limitations of minute phones!    The single thing that makes this phone worthwhile is that for about $35.00 for this phone and $78.00 for a year card with 400 minutes which equals 1200 minutes plus a PROMO CODE I FOUND ON TRACFONE FOR 250 MORE MINUTES ON THEIR WEBSITE for a grand total of 1460 minutes AND a year plus (60 OR 90) days on the phone.  QWERTY Keys are tiny and hard to read!    Numbers are a group of keys on this board and even harder to use EXCEPT FOR A CHILD whose hands are smaller!!!!    MY 12 year old DAUGHTER was able to get it to store songs for her by recording thru the input! but I am not sure how!  TEXTING USES UP ONE HALF MINUTE PER TEXT! BOTH INBOUND AND OUTBOUND! aND OF COURSE TRACFONE TEXTS YOU USING UP MINUTES!  REGISTRATION with TracFone is CUMBERSOME AND requires another phone WITH LOTS OF MINUTES AND IS EXTREMELY CUMBERSOME INVOLVING ACCRUATELY INPUTTING SEVERAL 15 DIGIT NUMBERS or an internet connection to get started!      This is a triple minute phone! It comes with 10 minutes ONLY AFTER ACTIVATION which is not enough to add more minutes!  MINUTES are used FOR BOTH INBOUND AND OUTBOUND CALLS!   See the TracFone site for a current promo code to add extra minutes when topping up.  This LG phone has few after market items available!  LG has little info on its website and none at all on its uk site.  Phone supports BLUETOOTH but I am not sure how to work it to perhaps add features!  ACCESSORIES:  LG and TracFone have very little on their websites on this phone. Calling LG however yielded that Amazon carries their accessories! And that as i understand the phone uses some form of LINUX by TracFone, which if true means that it MIGHT have potential to be a really nice smartphone!  Cords use Standard plug. Thank Goodness!  Screen protectors ARE AVAILABLE (BUT I THINK ONLY ON AMAZON!AND PERHAPS NOWHERE ELSE ON THE WEB!)    I would love to see more on this phone from someone who is more phone savvy than I am!    If this phone uses LINUX based OS then It should be a simple thing to force them to come up with the full source of the OS changes due to copyright sharing restrictions on almost all free operating systems."	1
"For a phone the size I like, it meets all the features that I need and more. Also liked getting the extra Tracfone minutes, texts, and data."	1
"For a smartphone that is 4-5 years old the iPhone 5 is still a versatile gadget. It's not the lighting fast iPhone 7, but this phone won't lag you to death. After being plagued by screen disease on the iPhone 6 Plus and after 5 replacement phones from Apple and my phones Carriers insurance i finally became fed up and bought the last good iPhone I owned.   Expect to replace the battery on these phones, due to the age the battery life will no longer be acceptable for every day use. The good news is that replacing the battery is easy and can be done with the right tools. Watch a lot of YouTube videos and take your time."	1
"for all shoppers, DON`T EVEN THINK OF BUYING BY THIS SELLER! i had very bad experience with them, my old phone got broken so i ordered a new one by this seller , first it arrived more than a week late, but i`m still not finish, finely i start using it and boom the phone is dead what`s going on? till i figure`t out that the battery was a broken one O MY! so please thing 2 times before shopping by this seller                                                                                "	0

"For business, emails, and texting, no other phone can even come close to this blackberry. Its a shame that these reviews appear in ebayers listings without their approval!"	1
For me this seller is a thief. Because I bought a galaxy s7 ppr 380 dollars and I just send the charger and lost my money. After he told me to give him a few days to send it to me. As I sent only the shipper already had a tracking number and with that I check eBay that supposedly abia sent. I call it a robbery and I'm sorry but this will not stay that way. I do not earn the easy money to lose 380 dollars like this	0

"For starters it says the phone has never been opened and the box was open than it says the phone is unlocked and its NOT!!!! When I recieved the phone I put my sim card in it and it said &quot;service failure&quot;, so I had to take it to a phone repair shop and had to pay to get it unlocked AND had to get the software repaired because it was corrupted. At the phone repair shop I was ALSO told that the phone had been REFURBISHED and it clearly says the phone is NOT REFURBISHED!!!!! After going threw all that trouble to actually get the phone to work I was having problems getting service in doors in order to use it i had to be out doors, I thought it was my sim card so I got a new one and that still wasn&apos;t the problem. I spent all this money on this phone for it to stop working after 3 weeks I am COMPLETELY disappointed and VERY upset this was completely misleading!!!!!!!!!!!!!"	0
For such a decent price. 	1
"For the first few days i had the phone it worked great. Within the first week i started experiencing more and more problems. From the phone randomly freezing, to just shutting down. The text messaging has gradually gotten slower and slower. As you type, the letters appear 5 to 10 seconds after you have written the word. Fortunatly the seller offered and exchange and return without any problems."	0
"For the money, this phone is almost unbeatable on Verizon. Performance feels like a Pixel 2 but costs half as much or less! There are quite a few cases made and we found two on Amazon that looked good and were functional. Literally considering a second one."	1
"For the price , it was a great bargain . My daughter loves it. Thanks."	1
For the price i highly recommend-9-40-ar15 simcard which are 4g LTE and a standalone SD card and a solid camera good battery- Blu accessories are first2none!!!	1
"for the price I paid, the phone will suffice, phone tends to shut itself off, and the quality of pictures are less than average.  I would suggest this phone only to those seeking something simple and not for quality."	0
for the price this has what I desire only . Phones today have way to much capabilities that most people never use or forget how to use.	1
"for the price you cant go wong ,get the apn settings from tour carrier and your good to go"	1
"For the price, it is a good way to start into the Android world.  With a cheap carrier like MintSIM ($260/yr for 5 gb of 4 G service each month for a year on T-Mobile service, including the SIM card of your choice)."	1
For the record... Visited Verizon and they would NOT put this phone on their network.	0

"Functionally speaking, these phones are great; the battery is removable, the controls are in a good place, and the 8MP front camera is fantastic.

"Fr meinen Sohn habe ich ein Handy mit Fotofunktion gesucht und bin dabei auf das Nokia N90 gestoen.Ich habe auch schnell ein Handy gefunden und die Beschreibung klang gut : &quot; kompletter Lieferumfang -einziger Makel: ein Sprung im Display &quot; . Der Verkufer hatte auch 99,8% positive Bewertungen - was soll da noch schiefgehen ?? Im letzten Moment habe ich das Gert dann auch ersteigert und das Geld sofort berwiesen. Nach 8 Tagen war das Gert dann auch da: Schwamm drber - manchmal gehts nicht schneller. Als ich das Gert dann ausgepackt habe, konnte ich meinen Augen kaum trauen. So, wie das Gert aus irgeneinem Firmenauto rausgenommen wurde, ist es in den Karton gestopft und verschickt worden.Der Sprung im Display wurde erwhnt und war ok.Das ganze Gert war verklebt, weil die Akkuabdeck. mit einem Klebeband fixiert war - eine neue wurde immerhin mitgeschickt. Ausserdem lsten sich beidseitig die Plastikverblendungen und das ganze Gert war komplett verkratzt, verschmiert, verklebt... Nachdem ich das Nokia grob gesubert und die neue Abdeckung vom Akku befestigt hatte, wollte ich das Handy aufladen, da der Akku komplett leer war.Das beigepackte ( besser beigeworfene..) Ladegert passte aber nicht , weil es den groen Nokia-Pin hatte, das N90 aber den kleinen Stecker bentigt. Also - Verkufer freundlich angemailt und gewartet...3 Tage lang - dann eine zweite Mail und im Abstand von 2 Tagen immer wieder eine. Zwei Wochen lang - ohne Reaktion . Dann habe ich den Fall bei Ebay gemeldet - keine Reaktion vom Verkufer..Nach drei Wochen hatte ich die Nase voll - wegen 30,- Euro la ich mir kein Magengeschwr wachsen : negative Bewertung abgegeben und den Fall bei Ebay geschlossen. Was dann folgte klingt unglaublich : Ich bekam eine Email - vom Verkufer ,Bernd Flgel persnlich !!!Und das gleich am nchsten Tag !!Meine Begeisterung war grenzenlos, wusste ich doch, das dem guten Mann nichts schlimmes zugestoen ist. In der Email brachte Herr Flgel seine berraschung ber die gegebene Bewertung zum Ausdruck und schrieb mir wortwrtlich &quot; Schmutz gehre zum Gebrauch &quot; und weiter  &quot; nach dieser Bewertung nehme er das Gert selbst aus Kulanz nicht zurck &quot; . Das Handy habe er vor kurzem noch mit dem Ladegert aufgeladen ( zur Info - der Akku war leer..). Und ich solle kein Neugert erwarten...Zwischenzeitlich habe ich eine zweite negative Bewertung eines anderen Kufers gelesen, der ebenfalls ein falsches Ladegert und keine Antwortmails monierte - auf Anfrage bei diesem Kufer und der Hoffnung , das dieser Kufer mein Ladegert hat, kam heraus, das  hier fr ein Nokia-Handy ein Motorola Ladegert mitgeliefert wurde und dem Kunden ein Umtausch nur angeboten wurde, wenn die Bewertung zurckgenommen wird. Erpressung, also.  Der  Herr Flgel schrieb mir weiterhin, das Mails nur an eine bestimmte Adresse gesendet werden mssen und er nur am Wochenende antworten kann, weil er arbeiten msse . ( ein gewerblicher Verkufer bei Ebay, wohlgemerkt..)Lauter wirre Ausflchte , die gut zu seinem schwammigen Geschftsgebaren passen. Aber offensichtlich haben hier die meisten Kufer positive Erfahrungen gesammelt, und ich gehre zu den 0,2 Prozent mit schlechten Erfahrungen. Wenn bei diesem Verkufer etwas schiefluft, was  ja durchaus auch einmal passieren kann, ist man bei diesem Verkufer verloren.Leider. Denn einen  guten Verkufer erkennt man nicht nur an seinen Berwertungen, sondern vor allem daran, wie er mit Reklamationen umgeht.Daher : Note 5 - setzen."	0

Good prices on cell phones. The one thing that didn&apos;t come with the cell phone case. I like that this cell phone has loud ring tones and I am able to hear it real good in the loud surrounding I work in. The other thing that I didn&apos;t like is that I emailed the person that I bought the cell phone and I did not get a response on what was going on with the shipping. But before I knew it I got the cell phone in the mail. Need to answer any questions the buyer has in a reasonable time frame.	1

The V10 was in really great shape! I haven't tried to put it on a service yet bit I might do that one day, I mostly just wanted it for a Vr phone and it's pretty awesome for that! 5 stars for sure on that one! As for the G4 it's probably going to be turned on.Got the G4 today. Good looking phone.in good shape. Bit it's a Vr phone too!

"Got one used from eBay a while back ago. Great condition everything worked great. Accidentally dropped it one day when I was walking in the garage. I didnt think much of it cause its built very rugged. But it immediately started having problems with call receptions and I have been constantly having call quality problems ever since. People reported my voice was broken up, there was constantly horrible delays in conversations, and a lot of the times I just plain couldnt hear them anymore. Nothing but silence in the ear piece. Plus the battery doesnt last if you actually use it to make frequent phone calls. All in all this is a phone that actually needs to be babied cause it does become problematic after a one foot drop to concrete."	0
"Got phone the next day, exactly as described. very helpful when answering questions, so far very satisfied."	1
Got ripped off never got the phone or the money	0
"Got the item 25% less the smallest price I found in Russia.    It is just as described everywhere in the Internet.    They say it has weak battery - yes, if U use Wi-fi and|or GPS it will work for a day. Think this is no problem: U can buy 3 batteries+charger for approx. $20.    The seller did his work perfectly: I got a new item as promised, with some extra gifts enclosed."	1
Got the old myTouch slide. The sound quality sucks and couldn't connect to T-Mobile network.	0
got the phone and it lasted 1 day and still fighting to get a refund so not saying the model is no good buy seller is below standerd	0
Got the phone and sprint activated it but the phone still wouldnt get a signal.  Phone is an expensive ipod	0
Got the phone for a very awesome price....Love the color....everything was perfect.....nothing was damaged. I love it seeing how it was a gift to someone.	1
Got the phone for my Wife she wanted a small Blackberry. I had one a few years ago and think its one of the best blackberry phones ever. Small but with a qwerty key board. Only bad thing about the whole buying was that i found the parl ball to be a little sticky.....with use it may get better. Great phone Cheap ideal for when we go overseas.	1
"Got the phone in a timely manner.  Took it to Verizon store to activate.  Had all sorts of problems with it..calls dropped, didn&apos;t hold a charge, etc.  The vendor was excellent...I sent it back and got credit immediately.  Buying phones online is tricky, but then buying from the mobile carrier is just as difficult as the one I got next from Verizon directly STILL gave me problems.  Price for the ebay one was comparable and you don&apos;t have to re-sign for another two years with the carrier, which is a PLUS."	0
got the phone late had to pay 30.00 pound for costums and then when i got the phone i could not use it has i had to have an at&amp;t card which did not come with the phone in the end had to pay 15 pounds to fix the phone all in all i payed 105 for the phone then 20 for p&amp;p and then a other 30 pounds for customs and then 15 pounds to get it all up and runing.asked seller for help verry helpfull but what he told me to do did not work. all work ok now tho.	0
Got the phone with an old KitKat. It came up with a message to update to Lollipop. As soon as I did that the wifi stopped working. Had to send the phone to LG. Been without a working phone for a long time. Should get it back this week. 	0
Got the product in a very timely manner. It was exactly what it was discribed to be. Would definetly buy from this seller again.	1
"got this as an exact replacement for the same phone whose screen cracked.  Still a great phone, even as a 2013 model.  I love the small form factor. "	1
Got this for my husband and he loves it!  It got here really fast and in perfect condition and it was packed nicely so it would not be damaged.  I would for sure buy from this seller again. A+++++++++++++	1
Got this one along with an Alcatel cell phone. Liked the Alcatel much better. Had many more pluses than the rebel for my needs. 	0
"Got this phone as an upgrade for me and my husband since the price was for 2! Awesome value. I was a little disappointed in the memory but since it came with an sd card, I called Tracfone and they told me how to move apps to memory card, freeing up space for contacts.I wish I had a car charger."	1
"Got this phone at Xmas for my son after 4 months of use the battery wont hold charge,  two of our friends have same phone and are having same problems.  Virgin will not ship batteries so you have to purchase new ones and ask for credit.  Obiously the phone is not well made.  Bought a new battery and it now won&apos;t reconize the battery did for a few minutes ad the says it needs a battery inserted.  Have sent away for warranty but virgin won&apos;t pay for the replacement battery."	0
"Got this phone for my daughter, using it on the pageplus network, $39.95 even monthly fee. No hidden cost taxes or other fees. Everything works unlimitted text , phone and Internet works great and fast. Very happy with this phone. easy to use"	1
"Got this phone for my Granddaughter, and she loves it."	1
Got this phone from seller unlocked but it asked me for unlock code. I decided to flash the phone so I can dictate what I must have on the phone.  Flashed it and took off the bloat ware for both Samsung and At&t and now it has a great battery life. I charge once a day after 14 hours of usage with 40% battery. The newer note phones have great features but what more do u need in a phone. It takes all the apps I need and calls are fantastic. Am a heavy phone user and flashing it gave me tethering access to share with my laptop as my work required me to go some places with no wifi so I have my own wifi. It's a good buy and would recommend anyone who knows about phones to get such a phone. Good performance and battery life are worth an older version of a galaxy note 2. 	1
"Got this phone in December...great phone, cute.. but photo quality is poor, and because it is a slide phone it sometimes closes while it is in use and hangs up/disconnects the call.  Thats the only problem i have with this phone.. I don&apos;t like the slide phones."	0
Got this phone this morning set it up then try to set it up. It was still connected to verison. I contacted them yet were unable to do anything about it. Then went onto a compatibly test on two different cell companies. Both told me that it wasnt compatible. Contacted the seller and will return unless this can be resolved. Waste of time.	0
Got this product after i had my own for 4 years only replaced the screen and charger port on my old one but mother board was so old i thought a new one would be great. But after 1 and a half months with this product the calling system started glitching and now anytime someone calls me it sounds like there several rooms away and you can hear them. if you switch to speaker phone you can hear them but when you talk it makes the same negative effect to the. i had my old note 3 for over 2 years before anything wrong happened which is why i wanted a new note 3. which they assured me it was even tho it didnt come with the original note 3 box. so i dont know if they are telling the truth or they think they actually have a new non referbrished one and just didnt know. all i know now is ill have to drop a bunch of money to get this supposedly new phone fixed after a month and a half of use.	0
"Got to me fast, accurate description. LOVE THIS PHONE. Also, I emailed the seller and responded fast and very helpful. Bought it because the price was alot more resonable then t-mobile. Trustworthy seller.  I thank you again."	1

"Great affordable phone with ability to do ALOT of custom dev to. I sell these modified with a custom streamlined Android OS operating system, custom recovery and rooted with a superuser to manage root requests and permissions. People love them.

Great back up when we need one.I bought this phone for my 10 year old son. he loves it.  Thanks I would recommend one.	1
"Great Basic Cell Phone with Push to Talk! Highly recommend for people who are not smart phone savvy, not everyone can work the new smart phones, so basic cells are still handy and useful!"	1
"Great battery life and quality is great.  Smaller than the i4, couldn't ask for anything better."	1
"Great battery life, crisp display,  awesome camera! Having some trouble sending and receiving pictures but should be easily resolved.  Overall I love it! Just what I hoped it would be. Shipping was very fast,  and it came with a lot of extra stuff I didn't expect! Definitely recommend to my friends!  "	1
Great battery life; enjoying trying to learn its features.  The phone was recommended by a friend.  I dislike having to wait the few seconds to unlock to get a call.  Good product.	1

Great buy...best deal for the price I've seen yet. So glad I stumbled upon your listing! Thanks so much!!	1
Great buying experience 	1

"Great cell phone, fast , lot of storage capscity, other of great pre installed aps, best of the 5 cell phones I have owned over the last fifteen years"	1
"Great cell phone.  A little smaller so it is easier to get in and out of my pocket.  The battery is smaller too, so it does not last as long as some, but I still get 2+ days out of a charge.  The sound is very good and folks seem to hear me just fine."	1
Great cellphone for a cheap price. I recommended the Moto G 2nd generation. This model can be actualized the operating system with no additional cost. Is easy to use and the size is easy to keep in any pocket.	1
"great cellphone, received as described, battery was not working, he send me a new battery, no charge, will buy again from this buyer!!!"	1
Great clarity. Only problem is that the camera doesn&apos;t work. I bought the phone for my daughter and she signed up for an inexpensive plan which works for her because she&apos;s only 11.	1
Great communication from seller. Phone is as described and works great. Bought another one from same seller as a spare.	0
Great communication with the buyer. Really nice phone and features that are very user friendly.Would recommended it for anyone.	1

Great communication. Very happy with the phone (It was as described. My daughter hasn&apos;t hardly put it down in days - she says it&apos;s the best phone she&apos;s ever had. Super fast shipping! I would highly reccomend this seller.	1
"GREAT COMMUNICATOR!!.... And excellent idea to load an LG G2 with G4 software.  Even a few more features the LG G4 doesn&apos;t have, at least as far as I know.  I&apos;m yet to utilize everything this phone setup can do, but primarily went with this for the quality HD &amp; 4K video capabilities.  Blows the competition away!    When you can get practically EVERYTHING you would need or want with out the price tag of a BRAND NEW LG G4.. This is the way to go.  Noticed he offered the LG G3 with the G4 upgrade too.  That&apos;ll be worth the price of admission for the options of external storage &amp; easily replaceable battery.      My son shopped ebay too, but bought a used LG G2, before we discovered this auction.  Now my son is sorely tempted to send in his phone for the software conversion.  (Just under $50) .    No longer will we be buying the latest and greatest when we have such a great service for upgrades available.  If you&apos;ll notice, even the accessories for GREAT phones like the LG G2 are greatly  less expensive now than when they originally came out.  You&apos;re saving $$$$ all the way around, not wanting to throw in another cliche... but you can have your cake &amp; eat it too!!!!      Highly recommend this seller &amp; his products..."	1

Great features androidis great.... only get incoming calls rarely and goes straight to voice mail 90% of the time. Have to place a call up to 6 times before it dial through. good if ya want internet... not if you want to make and place calls. dont give you babysitter this number cause in an emergency they wont be able to reach you unless the call you 100 times	0
"Great features, looks sleek. Great technology on the phone. Works great. I bought this as an upgrade from my metro pcs samsung admire. it was really different. im so happy i upgraded. even though this phone is a year old it was worth it. the phone is still a great phone to have."	1
"Great flip phone ! ! ! Fairly small in size but built tough. Just the right features and not an abundance of things to be confusing.   Negative.  The key on side of the phone should be programmable for something  beside using the ""Radio"" feature. I am not subscribing to that service. "	1
"Great for use with a TracFone simcard, not to mention all of the apps on the Windows store. "	1
"Great gadget, signal improved greatly. I can hear better, noise and static reduced. Thanks, would recommend to everyone I know."	1
"Great graphics, nice OS."	1
Great heavy duty flip phone!	1
Great improvement over the original Razr. This is the second one i&apos;ll own. The first one gave me two years of excellent service until I jumped in a pool with it in my pocket.   Improvements are  -Beefier and stronger hinge  -No Dust gets in the screen  -Excellent quality camera  -Screen resolution  -User friendly operating system and interface  -long battery life for the most part. After 18 months my battery life suddenly went much lower and I&apos;d have to charge it every night. Got a new battery and the darn thing lasts all week.     Great phone.	1

great little phone for the money. It came without instructions but they are readily available from Motorola.  I like it better than my blackberry.	1

Great phone for a fear price ....thanks	1
Great phone for a great price!	1
Great phone for a reasonable price.   Really easy to activate.  It came as advertised and really looked better than I thought it would.	1
"Great phone for all uses. It's very durable for a hard working or playing user. Wet, dirty and impact prone environments are great for this phone. I operate heavy equipment, work on farm equipment and run a saw mill. All of these areas are very hostile to equipment including a normal phone. I destroyed my first two within a few weeks. The Casio 4g has great reception. It did use data and battery very fast until I disabled the unused apps. A great feature. I would recommend this phone to any one that wants a phone to last for years. "	1
"Great phone for anyone who needs a durable phone.  This is the closest replica to the nokia brick that could be nearly destroyed and still opperational.  My first phone was the same model, and everyone knows how kids treat their phones ( accidentally of course).  This is my second phone put to hard abuse motor shop and farm hand use and has never let me down.  Has all the features needed in a regular phone without the price or sensitivity to breakage.  I would highly recommend this phone to anyone."	1
Great phone for great price 	1

Great phone good price this the second phone that bought from this seller and have been just what they said it would be great seller thanks	1
"Great phone great camera. Take some time to adjust coming from a Samsung,(missing the edge screen and some air movements). Lightning fast. No glitches. Do all jobs fast? Google Assistant is in another level (I dictate this review, set alarms, start Spotify and play music) does everything in a fun way). Unfortunately only in English no Greek language. Sound over Bluetooth is great. A lot of steps to configure the volume. Louder and higher quality than expected from a Bluetooth transmission. The screen is very nice but it's not a Samsung... Watching movies is okay but on dark scenes, you lose a lot of information. Need to boost The screen light just to see the scene. The camera is exceptional. Took a picture in 0 light and it came out astonishing. GPS is fast and accurate. Very satisfied"	1
Great phone had an 8330 for a while decided that it was time for a upgrade. No complaints clear calls and works well.	1

Great phone like new! Very fast service !	1
"Great phone looks good and Works better, simple and easy to operate for a person that needs to talk, send text messages and answer a few emails but it does more than that, because of its memory, you can have many apps, that was an extra for me. On the negative side, the charger didnt work, so, I had to spend more money than anticipated to buy a charger to go with the phone  "	1

"Great phone, love all the features."	1
"Great phone, no issues at all. Read the reviews and they were all positive and it turns out the phone is just what I would expect in a much more expensive phone."	1
"Great phone, perfect size and weight, tons of apps from ovi.com and other sites, GPS works great, touch screen very responsive, camera takes good quality pics, battery lasts long, only disappointment dial pad has no letters and don&apos;t seem to find a way to make it show the letters I hope they fix that in next software update"	1
"Great phone, quick response. Good size and handling; good new features, the camera is in my opinion one of the best. The screen is excellent, very sharp. The battery after 12 has of light use; checking mail and texts a few times, 2 phone calls, going into the web about 3 times for 5 minutes each time aproximately, etc., still has 70% of juice. Happy with this product."	1

Great phone.  Just what I was looking for.  I had one like it and needed a new one.  I am glad that I found one. Great choice for anyone.	1
Great phone.  Quick delivery.  Great seller	1
"Great phone.  The seller said it was locked to Vodaphone [Carphone Warehouse] but it wasn&apos;t and I don&apos;t think any of the phone upgrades are locked.  I&apos;ve added 16Gb so all my music [22 Gb] is on there.  No turn by turn maps, but I&apos;m sure that will turn up in one form or another this summer.  Takes a little while to get used to but handles my email and surfing very well.  The keyboard at first is a bit weird but it grows on you.  No practical apps yet, well none that I can find, you can run as many of the on board applications as you like.  I have my email open most of the time while I&apos;m surfing listening to music.   Not many accessories yet, but have a decent leather wallet, just need an car holder.  I would rate it better than an Iphone based on memory capacity multi tasking and looks."	1
Great phone. All cell bands.  Working 100 percent on Verizon! Comparable to Samsung flagships for hundreds less.	1
"Great phone. Can be used to link into your Xbox Live account. Has a fantastic camera on it that takes great pics. The app market for the Windows platform is steadily growing, with tons of amazing and helpful free apps you can download. The Zune software it interfaces with is pretty decent as well. Love the tiles, very easy to use. I also think this is the only windows phone with a full keyboard, which is nice since I hate touch-screen only phones. The only bad thing I can think of is that sometimes it gets your contacts all mixed up because of the way it links several profiles - it can get confusing and is time consuming to sort out. The battery usually lasts all day and then some, depending on what you&apos;re doing with the phone. The phone is also SUPER durable. I have had this phone swept out by a wave at the beach, I grabbed it, immediately took out the battery and sim card, and let it dry in the sun and it was totally fine. Also spilled vodka all over it one time and did the same drying procedure except I used a space heater and it works just fine. This is my second purchase of this phone, I am saving my other perfectly functional one for parts and as a spare. If I am willingly buying a second one of these phones, that should show you that its pretty sweet!"	1
Great phone. Easy to use for everything. The keyboard is very easy to use and the keys are very well space. the use of the d-pad is very useful and easy to manage and use.	1
Great phone. Even better value.	1
Great phone. Exactly what I expected.	1
Great phone. Great service 	1
Great phone. Has gad a few glitches with touch screen but for the price it beats Verizon's and I wont complain!!	1
Great phone. I had a Pixel 1 and now this--better battery and faster.  	1
Great phone. In great condition and unlocked. I love it. Thanks for your speedy service. 	1
"Great phone. Love the pink, works great. The back does come off easy when I drop it. One might argue that I should be more careful with it though. Good phone."	1
"Great phone. My first android phone, bought it from hsn for $150.  Its quite fast, battery is ok; i just lowered the brightness and used a battery saving app.  It&apos;s even better if you root it, you can speed it up to 1.3ghz, compared to it stock and raise the lowest value 300mhz to any higher mhz to boost up basic speed and save battery(not for everyone, you might brick the phone in the process).  $55 plan is great for unlimited, especially if you use boostmobilesav.com you can reload for $53.50.  the 4gb memory card can easily be upgrade to a 32gb for a massive storage option.  camera is good quality, 5MP is good for sharp detailed pictues."	1
Great phone. Nothing really special. But different from other phones. A little too big. --------------	1
"great phone. packed with features. this phone was pre-used but aside from some minor scratches on the screen otherwise in great shape. i was able to configure it to receive picture messages. T-mobile said i had to purchase there data plan to receive them. T-mobile, shame on you. In the future if one of my other phones goes belly up I will definatly purchase another phone through this seller. my wife is very happy with the phone and im very happy with the seller with there response with my questions i had for them with the phone."	1
Great phone. Seller did exactly what they promised. Would buy from this seller again!	1
"Great Phone. Super fast 4G LTE. Apps load very quick, any pictures or highdef videos are very clear. One thing i wish they would invent is longer lasting batteries."	1
Great phone. The battery life is great on this phone. I flashed a custom rom after getting it and everything works great.	1
"Great phone. The white BB is unique. Fast and handy. Knows everything and the battery keeps running for 2-3 days with intense use.  Pros: Handy, smart and fast, made of high quality materials.  Cons: The only cons is the necessity of the data plan, but without a data plan it doesnt worth to buy it.  Compared to the other phones the price/value ratio is high."	1
"Great phone. Very good reception -- could be a little better, but I&apos;m a perfectionist and its not bad enough to count as a strike against it. Great features. Easy to learn, easy to use."	1
Great phone. We love the ease of navigation &amp; ability to customize the tiles. All reviews of this phone speak of how durable it is &amp; those are true. The camera has taken great pictures. Having come from an Iphone 4s it has been an easy transition. The only downside of this phone is its weight.	1
"Great phone.. Lost one and would not settle for any other phone. Comes with a big amount of memory for songs and videos, loud speaker and has plenty of custom cases to add style. Only downfall would be keyboard buttons are small but only phone so far with full keyboard i could text with one hand. Also has Micro SD slot for more memory.. all around awesome phone"	1
"great phone.......very pleased......thank you......Fast service, would buy from this seller again! The phone is wonderful, fast and fun to use. I have grandchildren, horses and raise mini autralian shepherd puppies. I take tons of pictures and will have plenty of storage for all!"	1

"great used phone at a great value.battery life is a little short, but just ordered a new one. the phone came loaded with a lot of preinstalled apps. just getting to useing them. phone does very fast downloads. google android is a great o/s."	1
"Great value - bought this to replace a new LG smartphone.  The only downside is that the contacts had to be entered manually b/c it was not compatible (""not smart enough"" per Sprint) with the Sprint computer that would have done the transfer.  They said they could try to do it with bluetooth, but we opted not to since there weren't that many contacts in the old phone and didn't have time.  A great basic phone for someone that isn't facile with smartphones and just wants a cellphone."	1
"Great value coupled with the Windows Operating System which is far superior to Android.  Why ""Windows Operating System"" is not more popular is mystifying.  Probable poor marketing from Microsoft and mobile phone companies.  This phone has speed, clarity, ease of operation, excellent reception in all areas.  The only item that is missing and they should have included is a ""Battery Charging Light"" which shows ""Red"" during charging and ""Green"" when fully charged.  Size is perfect.  Big enough for easy surfing but small enough to wear on your belt and run with etc."	1
Great value for a decent phone I was hoping it was one with a Kevlar back but that no biggie. Big thanks still 	1
Great value!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Quality product and great service..I love my gusto dumb phone......	1

"Ha sido rapidsimo tardaron dos semanas, increble. Muy satisfecho totalmente recomendable el vendedor "	1
habe mir ein 8800 arte carbon geholt das erste was mir aufgefallen ist nur ein bluetooth headset dabei(was i.wie nichtmal richtig fest hlt im ohr) bei einem handy dieser preisklasse sollte sowas dabei sein habe noch nicht geguckt was ein headset dafr kostet denke allerdings es sollte nicht ganz billig sein.dann diese funktion mit dem handy das wenn man es dreht der anruf angewiesen wird vollkommen schwachsinn min 30% der anrufe werden abgewiesn weil ih es wenn ich es in einer tasche habe i.wie beim rausholen drehe oder sowas..ansonsten is die verarbeitung erste sahne die leder taschae soviel tischlade station sind nette mitbringsel was ich auch noch gut finde is das das ladekabel nichtmehr nur so ein dnnes ding is was schnell brich oda biegt sondern ein usb was sich als vorteil erweist mein vorgnger handy is bei laden runtergfallen und das dnne metal ding abgebrochen somit konnte ich erstmal nicht laden und drfte mir ein neues ladekabel holen..alles in allem zu kleines display zu teuer kein richtiges headset wrde es mir nicht wieda holen vorallem wenn man davor an ein n96 bzw omnia gewhnt war is das ein rckschritt vom knnen der display grsse..	0
Had a few more scratches on the screen but I'm very satisfied with what i recieved. A great deal. Thanks.  	1
Had a great buying experience however I'm not a fan of the phone.  It doesn't support my most recent apps and I can't upgrade to a higher IOS	0
Had a problem with phone! Sent seller messages to contact me! Never did. Opened a claim against seller had 10 days to respond and resolve the issue. He never responded. Not a responsible seller urge not to buy from this seller!.	0
Had a small issue but seller quickly responded and remedied the problem. 	1
Had an exact phone and it fell and broke. Wanted to replace it with the exact model and got it. Great phone for the price!	1
Had barely got the phone going and had to reset it because of a couple concerns and because I couldn't remember my ages old haven't used for years original Google account I will have to send it back to the factory for reset. I am a 75 year old disabled senior citizen its very hard for me to do! Bad practice on Google and LG! George Meek	0
"Had concerns that this would feel too large in my hand. After about a week or two, it becomes second nature and you dont even notice. I used the 6s for years, used to doing everything with one hand and thumb.  I actually prefer this now. It reminds you to stop and be safe, doing everything with one hand is not always a good thing!"	1
"Had It Before, Wanted It Again!!!! It&apos;s A Awesome Phone!!!! But You Must Buy Extra Batteries, They Don&apos;t Last Long, But They Don&apos;t Cost Much, Get Three!!!!!!"	1
Had it over a year and it still works perfect.	1
"Had my phone 1/2 hour and it was getting HOT to the touch, text seller, who said phone heats up when you first turn it on and charge,  a week later, I'm sitting in my chair, phone next to me charging ( it had 50 %, I was topping it up ) and glanced over to see my phone GLOWING, I could NOT pick up, it was so hot, I unplugged and contacted seller, who said SEND IT BACK FOR FULL REFUND, rite now I'm just waiting for refund ?????"	0
Had no problem with it 	1
Had one before and was looking to replace because the screen on the one I had was damaged.  The price here was the best price for this phone.	1
Had one defect but it was rated as B condition so I fixed it myself. Still happy overall	0
Had one with a bad power switch stuck in boot looping.   Swapped a good screen for the cracked one and now cruising along on Android JellyBean.  A parts swap victory.  	1
"had problem with charger port right out of the box, not zoo hot, t mobile     agrees with this issue.  Bought new from seller in LA , thought i was getting good phone, not really!"	0
"had problems with charging port first week,the following week phones keeps on going off by itself on even on a full charge,doesnt charge anymore"	0
"Had questions on product, which were quickly resolved. Would definitly deal with this seller again."	1
Had several of this model phone over the years and they work well.	1
had the phone for less than a week I dropped it and broke right away the phone is very fragile and it should have been specified in the ad for the phone that it is fragile and you need a case for it I paid a lot of money for that phone and I had it for a week and now I can&apos;t do nothing with it	0
"Had this model before and didn't want to switch.  Was very happy to find this replacement.,  Great condition. Performs well.  thanks"	1
"Had this phone for 2 years.  It never dropped a call. Has the best voice quality of any phone I have ever used (I have a slight hearing loss and need the volume and clarity of this phone).  While traveling, my wife was constantly dropping calls on her other model phone on the same phone plan and had no problem with mine.  After two years, I replaced it with a different model phone and gave the Audiovox to her.  Two and 1/2 years after that, she would fight anyone who tried to take her phone even tho she is eligible for a new one free.  I am now searching for another CDM 8900 because I have never had a phone to perform as that one did for me and does for her now 4-1/2 years old.  It is such a shame that the best phone ever was taken off the market so soon.  It is still the best phone ever."	1
Had this phone for over 6 months and its been great.  Long battery life and reception where other phones have failed.  Had an issue in the first few weeks I had it with the sound quality being distorted but I sent it in to Nokia and they fixed it up.  No problems since.  I&apos;ve dropped this phone multiple times and it still works.	1
"Had this phone when they first came out with AT&T. Two years later I changed carrier and cell phone, now the phone was great while I had it no problems what soever with it. Now I have it again and it`s been more then a week. No problems or issues, I received phone before the delivery date. And in A+ condition like new as stated. Very happy !!!"	1
Had to get an android phone for uber and door dash apps to work. This phone was half price of what consumer cellular wanted. It is the same size as my windows phone and they both fit my belt case together. I kept windows phone active as it was only $10 for my second line and was able to sync the phones together and transfer my information to both. This phone is all and more than I expected and I'm elderly.	1
had to many marks for the price not happy 	0
"Had to replace the phone after a couple of months, because Bluetooth kept crashing the whole phone. May have been just this unit, but it made it almost impossible to live with for me. Your mileage may vary."	0
had to return it could not get data or wifi	0
Had to return the phone would not connect to cell network all the time would have No Service most of time. No problem return was in my 30 day window. 	0
Had to send it back because it kept on saying it was 100% charged but when removed from the charger it would die and not turn on until put on thr charger again so had to return and now waiting for a replacement.	0
"Had to take it to a technician,only reason I didn't send back because I don't really have the time,phone doesn't work as described."	0
Hahahahaha bueno	1

"Hallo,  diese Handy ist ein biliger Trek aus China.  und der verkaufer ist ein turkisch Betrug  MfG 1974hutte!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"	0
"hallo, wir sind leider sehr enttuscht von diesem telefon.  ausser der optik ist wirklich nicht viel gelungenes an diesem handy.  der lautsprecher fr die musikwiedergabe ist so schlecht, da hr ich lieber meine alten schallplatten. der klang ist dumpf und nicht sehr laut.  auch beim klingeln geht die lautstrke nicht auf das gewnschte ma.  die filmwiedergabe ruckel sehr nervig.  ber den akku kann ich selbst leider nichts sagen, da dass telefon meine freundin benutzt.  im vergleich zu anderen handys in dieser kategorie schneidet dieses telefon sehr schlecht ab.  einziges, was mir an diesem telefon gefllt ist, dass man einstellen kann, dass es erst vibriert und dann klingelt."	0
"Hands Down, one of the best Blackberrry&amp;apos;s on the market. Really nice feel to it. Rubberized back with texture, chrome finish, and slick black front. Just feels solid in your hand. The trackball is the best on the market, slightly raised for easy use and perfect tracking. You can now upgrade the bios to 6.0 which really works well on this powerhouse. Visual voicemail is a nice feature, plus the thousands of apps you can download. GPS works spot on. Have mine set up with the sidekey to use google maps, which is the best. Blackberry maps is not useful at all. Comes preloaded with Office basic. Has wifi, excellent for Skype calls and travel. Oh, when I travel I swap out the sim card to the international one and it works perfectly. I also use tether, use my phone as a high speed modem. Actually, used my laptop in my car, hooked up to my phone, hooked up to a web cam and it worked pretty well. All in all I would say, with its super bright screen, beautiful color, and overal build, would rate this phone 10/10"	1
"Happy over all. Good looking phone, excellent navigation. Good camera, but I come from an S3 I can tell there are differences. I liked the one on the S3 better"	1
happy with product	1
Happy with the way the product looks. New in a box. Shipped right when it was supposed to come. I would recommend this product.	1
"Hard for me to review as I purchased as gift for son in California.  So far, he really likes it.  Boost Mobile has a great deal going on with their Unlimited Plan."	1
"Hard to find a nice simple easy phone, but this one is it!  It works great for my sim card and is durable.  Had one before and had to have it again when my old phone finally died after much abuse.  These phones can take the abuse and still give great service and look nice too.  If you are looking for something to last and not trying to keep up with the latest technology, this one will fill the bill."	1
Hard to see screen with poor vision.  Gave it to my Niece because it is a great phone and will serve her well.	1
"Hardly any options to customize. Reception is awful in most places even when there are towers. Its takes to many steps to do everything, even just to send or reply to a text. Its just doesn't send it at times and just puts it in outbox, no notification no retry on sending."	0
Hardly any scratches now I have to get a sim to test it out. I was taking it to the phillipines with me.	1
"Has a flagship feel, but certainly is not a flagship specs by today's standard. But it is a solid device. Highly reccomended."	1
"Has a good sound to it.Other people can hear you good even on speakerphone.After playing about three songs it turns itself off automaticly.This is not a good feature.I bought it because it had a mp3 player,and a radio,but I dont like it turning itself off on me."	0
"HAS ALL THE FEATURES THAT I WANTED AND MORE. IT MEETS ALL OF MY EXPECTATIONS. THE SHIPPING WAS QUICK, AND I RECEIVED IT SOONER THAN I EXPECTED. "	1
has been one of my best purchases was a great investment	1
Has contract under Sprint was informed by Sprint that it has an 18th month contract for pay and cannot be activated once closed the account the phone will be blackballed and will be useless	0
has great signal and i got everything that was promised...only thing is the battery could last a little longer but other then that service was great	1
Has screen burn and chips in it. Was sold as mint condition which it is not..	0
has the screen burned thing that does not say in the description totally fraud	0
HAS WORKED WELL OVER TIME.GOOD SELLER.WAS IN NEW LIKE CONDITION	1
"Hate it!!! Battery sucks, constantly running background apps (35 at a time)!!! Mini USB doesnt plug in tight. Runs very hot!!"	0
"Hate this phone, can&apos;t hear anything and speaker doesn&apos;t really help except makes you louder to the other person. Hit the scroll button once on my favs and it scrolls past that person and lands on the next one. Signal cuts out alot."	0
have a good day today bye for now	1
have gotten 2 of these phones and they have both been excellent. Fast shipping with no surprises.  Thank you very much keep up the excellent service.  Elton	1
"Have had the phone for 60 days, emailed the seller with a problem (the volume keeps muting itself). I own a service business that is 24/7. I get my emergency pages via phone text. Can't get an alert if I don't hear the phone.  After speaking with the seller was told go onsite & just buy another one. Be-aware there is a 30 day guarantee with this seller.  My bad I didn't read carefully enough"	0
"hAVE LITTLE ISSUES. BUT SELLER WROTE ME, PHONE WAS 100% NEW. BATTERY LIFE IS NOT GOOD. AND CHARGER IS NOT USEFULL. NOT AS DESCRIBED ITEM!!!"	1
Have no doubt when dealing with this seller. The iPhone I bought is in terrific shape. Great value!!! He ships fast and is totally honest. He is a real gentleman. Thank you again Alex for such a good deal on the iPhone. 	1
Have not had it three weeks and it stopped charging. In fact the charging port waz broke off the mother board.	0
"Have not received anything yet! no response from the seller, is been more that 20 days and still waiting."	0
Have not recieved it yet ??	0
"Have only used this phone for a week or so, but it has handed everything I've thrown at it with easy and snappy response. The camera is wonderful if the lighting conditions are good, mediocre without. Then again this is not a dedicated camera. It's very fast and the battery life is great. "	1
Have purchase 3 of the G4 reconditioned from this seller.  My family loves them!	1
"Have this phone for 1 month now and the phone is not working already. Out the blue it is saying no SIM card. Also the phone screen is going black every 3 seconds, you can only unlock the screen then it black out again. Therefore I'm unable to do anything in the phone. So I'm back to square one, No phone again. Very poor purchase. Came in mint physical condition. Has a dent in the back and few scratches in which I can over look if the phone was working well. "	0
Have to many  scratches. And the charger wont fit  with galaxy s5 is Lg.	0
"Have to unlock sim, usually carrier locked phones are stated in listing title. Communicated with vendor and didn't get the slightest reimbursement "	0
"Have used the phone, text and the camera.  Very happy with all.  Will buy again and recommend it to others.  "	1
Haven&apos;t found anything for a dislike yet.  3D sound is amazing. Very nice size and display matched with a 12.6 camera. Love it.	1
Haven't had a chance to set-up yet...will review in a few weeks holidays too hectic!	1
haven't received item yet so not sure 	0
"Having a little trouble with the talk-to-text being really slow before it picks up my voice, and just getting used to the overall iPhone experience, I believe I like Android maybe a little better, but just on the fence as I have not had much time to use it and the apps and the format!"	1
"Having individual letters to touch makes texting SO much easier and more accurate than the typical on-screen keyboard. I dumped a bigger phone to go back to this model, which AT&T doesn't make anymore. "	1
"Having problem with the with the phone turn off  by itself  before  battery finish, voice too low, change the Parsons you on the phone talkingames change  to unknow "	0
"Having the Home, Back, &amp; Settings button that move with the screen is VERY convenient. Battery life is average. Don&apos;t like that some Apps(that came with the phone) can NOT be uninstalled. Great camera. Excellent, bright, &amp; clear screen."	1
hazardous and explosive	0
hazardous materials 	0
"He actually delivered a Locked iPhone & Plus He cheated and lied to me, that he will unlock it remotely, Nothing has changed since he lied to me I have try to text him about the problem, he chose to ignore and run away with my money. HE IS A THIEF "	0
He charge for new phone but he sent me used one  	0
He comprado varios y han salido excelentes 	1
"He didn't send a complete phone, it had no battery or back. I'm not satisfied with paying almost $50 for just the front of the phone!!"	0
He don't buy after the auction 	0
He has been happy with the phone and I was happy with the seller.	1
He is a liar! Shipping bad phone! deceive! Bad guys!	0
he is dual nature seller i asked him many time i don&apos;t want to buy cell so cancel purchase but this guy every time said o i ll do but he did nothing   still no response   so why i refer to my friends ?	0
"He keeps selling damaged phones or with bad esn even dough he says it has clean esn or in great working order, a big waste of time and money not a trusty seller"	0
he make the the title for this item unlocked iphone and it lock network 	0
He never took it off his iCloud.   So it is not useable. And now I have tried to active it and I can not. So now my granddaughter has no phone  	0
He put an item up for sale then pulled it after the transaction went through. Unreal.	0
"He said that hes selling an original phone with its original box, what was my surprise? It has a different imei comparing with ""its original box"" also its battery life isn't good"	0
He says it works fine but it doesnt any time the phone freeze and the battery is terrible very bad seller i loss money for this ......	0
He send me a simple letter not the phone package he said he posted my package looks at those pictures below thats the one I received dont waste your money his a scammer fake so I need my money back 	0
"He sent another phone, different than I bid,they spent more than 15 days to reimbursing to pay you "	0
"he sent me the ohone without a charger , then he lied to me and gave me thr wrong password . dont buy from him ! he will lie to you and play you dumb . now the phone is locked and he doesn't want to refund me . "	0
HE SOLD ME A F---KING PHONE THAT DIDNT WORK AND I PAYED ALL THAT MONEY AND I REPORTED HIM TO EBAY I AM SO MAD THAT I DON&apos;T KNOW WHAT TO DO IF EBAY DOESN&apos;T DO ANY THING ABOUT IT I WILL TAKE HIGHER THAN THAT CAUSE THEY SHOULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT SELLER PUTTING UP STUFF THAT DON&apos;T WORK	0

He trys to cover it up with his bad English but when he says not like the original. He means it's a fake. Some people won't even realize until it's to late so be careful and spend 50 more bucks to buy it from a respected dealer. 	0
he was not very responsive i emailed him twice and he never returned my emails. My phone did not work the way that he said it would and there were many other things about him that i did not like. My phone i paid 107 dollars for and now it does not work and it is sitting in my room doing absolutly nothing. I want my money back and he will not respond to me and i now have a phone sitting in my room that is useless.	0
"He will not accecpt your payment nor will he respond back to you. So what ever you do, do not buy from him. Not sure what his problem is, but I wouldn&apos;t reccomend it at all. I&apos;m still trying to get the money back that my credit card was charged. So please don&apos;t buy from him."	0
He wrote me asking if I read the whole description to make sure I understood the phones conditions. Once I saw what he meant I ask for a refund before he sent the phone but he hasnt responded since. Now Im money and and phone less.	0
"Heavily constructed of quality materials, and easily to do the light assembly!!  The moon seemed as if it were in arm'so reach!!  The photos ARE NOT an exaggeration!!!"	1
Hej kan se du har en mo il til salg fejler den noget   	0

"Hello, this review is really about the fact that the seller has relisted this very phone in that I have won in auction a day before. He did not allow me the 48 hours payment period to elapse, I have paid him the full cost within the 24 hours period. So in actual fact the phone is already paid for and will be in dispute with EBAY polices. See the attached photo that the seller says he reposted the items as he assumed it was fraud when i ask him for bank details to make a wire transfer and part Paypal payment. "	0
"Hello:    I&apos;m so angry couse I never recieve the product. I dont know why the seller send me it.  I cant trust again in your store, sorry for that. I wrote to the seller a messenge and them never answer me.    thank you for ask me about that.    Jency Ramos"	0
"Here are a few things that make this listing seem like a scam: 1) If you put the item in your cart and try to buy it, you wont be able to. You can try via credit card, paypal, and PayPal credit and none will go through.  2) you contact the seller and everything seems okay until you realize that he/she wants your personal address and you can only pay for the phone by using iTunes gift cards. Technically you wont be using paypal or ebay to make the purchase on the phone  so there is no buyer protection. If the product does not come, you're left holding the bag.   It is completely possible that this is a legitimate business; however, in all my 10 years on ebay, I have never had a seller act like this. Buyer Beware."	0
"Here is what I like about the LG G3. -It's fast and 32gb is plenty of storage. -The display is razor sharp. -The system layout is good. -The IR blaster is nifty. -It feels good in my hand, and is small for a 5.5"" phone. -Camera's great.  Here's what I don't like about the LG G3: -The battery drains quickly with screen brightness turned up. -The speakerphone is not the best.  I recommend the LG G3."	1

"hey, it&apos;s a cell phone - I use mine with the web access and text turned off, the flip design protects it until the hinge fails and then I buy another - I get 4 or 5 days battery life between recharges.  the downside is the antenna, that can snag on your pocket."	1

"Hi guys,    I  regret of buying this phones on ebay  because those guys who  sold this phones they knew that  those  phones  are ( Cdma) it mean  , it can only work in usa ; mexico and canada and those phones  can&apos; t be unlock but they let me bought it , knowing  that those phone  will not work in australia or  others country, except  usa, mexico and canada . Now i lost my money and  i hand up with those unuselless phones and i tried to contact those guys for  refund without any  reponse, so becarefoure when u buy  use phone on ebay, it must be gsm and not cdma.

"Hi the e-bay team,    It is very charming to see the items on sale and you are in disparate need of it.   I have not the chance to use the item i bought.   I paid for the Samsung galaxy s4 nearly $300.00 from seller in US. the deal was done on 24 of June 2014, and i was supposed to get the item by 16 of july, however today is the 11/08/14 and got neither the phone nor my money back. i opened the case and the seller and ebay team responded you are being paid through the same payment method as you bought the item and case is closed. I don&apos;t know how long will it take to get my money back with this secure ebay payment."	0
Hi this is to let you that I had a very BAD and again BAD experience  by buying a non-working phone I had to send it back the  a  few days after receiving to the sender.

"Hi, i did purchase this phone for Christmas gift around December  2nd and i was expected my item between Dec 8th and Dec 13th but i did not. i did travel without my product. i came back from a vacation 3 days ago and still not seen my purchase. Today i want a full refund including the damage caused during my Christmas Holiday because i was not able to sent my gift anymore. This seller does not deserve to sell on eBay because i contacted him and he did not reply before i traveled. please send my full refund because he did not ship my product before i contact my bank.  Thanks.   "	0
"Hi, I like the new phone, but I found out that Tracfone limited the firmware of the ZTE Zmax Champ LTE Model Z917L so that an micro SD card cannot be used as internal system memory as other companies using the same model allow for. If this had not been limited it would be a very good value. "	0
"Hi, Im not very happy with the decision this seller made on me, I won the item and paid for it right away for him to tell me an excuse to cancel on me after I told my daughter I have got the phone for her very disappointed very unprofessional seller and now I have to wait 3 business days to get my money back Im very disappointed and out of a good deal I won this shouldnt be happening who can I trust now!"	0

"Hi..I bought the NewPhone Samsung M8800 Pixon  for   US:177.99, I like the phone  But it was defective. Problem is it costs me $25.00 to send it to china for refund  I got the 100% refund.But I lost return shipping $25.00  for nothing  so what is the use to buy it . I think if the product is defective  seller must pay the return shipping other wise MAKE NO  SENSE to buy it from e-bay  peoples use e-bay to save money not to lose...thanks"	0
"High performance phone/tablet.  Beautiful screen.  Best part of this phone, compared to the latest model (Galaxy Note 5) is that I can add up to 64gb micro card for storage and buy additional batteries (which are not very expensive).  In last few days, I was able to upgrade to Android 5.1.1."	1

HONEST SELLER WHO SHOWS YOU THE CLEAN IMEI NUMBER SO I CHECKED THE IMEI WITH MY CELL PHONE PROVIDER. THIS IS THE BEST PHONE I EVER HAD AND THE SELLER DID NOT LIE ABOUT THE PHONES INTERNAL MEMORY LIKE MOST SELLERS DO.	1
"Honestly I should have NEVER purchased my Galaxy S3, but oh well, this phone is 32gb compared to my galaxy 16gb, and is incredible fast I bought it for my wife and daughter and of course the S3 for me, ohh well too late now to return it.  This Nexus is WAY ahead of the S3."	1
"Honestly, I loved this phone so much and it's a shame I dropped it in the toilet. It didn't have a long battery life (I had to charge it everyday before bedtime which for me is abnormal). I can understand the weak battery life though since it has a great screen with awesome resolution. My favorite part of this phone (aside from how beautiful it is to look at) would have to be the camera. I was able to get a lot of great selfies as well as rear camera photos -- so if you enjoy picture taking this phone is definitely awesome in that department. The biggest downside for me would be the fact that it isn't waterproof and it's not a phone you can go without a case with. Like every phone this one has ups and downs, but the ups definitely outweigh the downs!"	1
hoorrrible communication . the product was not working when I get it . not as describe . will never order from ebay again .	0
Hopefully it's as durable as it says for my daughter she needs it	1
Horendous I paid this person $180 and hes going to start avoid returning the item for me or somehow unlocking the phone or send me another one. IF YOU CANT at least send me a refund. dont be a ebay thief/scammer	0
Horrible battery life - two days on stand by is the max unlike the advertised 15?+. Received calls cannot be answered! What is that about? Swiping/pressing the receive call icon does NOT answer the call. Pathetic! The only saving grace is that of the small form factor but what's the point of that when the functionally and performance of the phone is useless. 	0
Horrible customer service 	0
"Horrible experience with this seller, I purchased an iPhone XR, which of course comes with a decent price tag, paid immediately following the notification I had won the bid. Sent the seller a question asking about the phone, and minutes later the seller cancelled my purchase without explanation. And then when asked why it was cancelled, the seller refused to provide insight as to why it was cancelled! Horrible..Buyer beware!!  "	0
horrible it is lock when it say unlock in the item discription.	0
Horrible phone doesnt work not worth 30 bucks  	0
horrible phone was misbehaving  was less than tolerable would and freeze up and also not let you go to any other screen other than the quick menu  long delays when screen was pressed qwerty buttons did not feel right at all not made for any one with big fingers all in all a 2 out of 10 it sucks that bad.	0
"Horrible phone.  Lasted 34 days and shut down.  Advised by Apple corporate store that it is not repairable  The seller (maxcelltech1) advised that they would not issue any form of refund because thy only have a 30 day warranty.  The Seller (maxcelltech1) sold a 3 year old phone as new and would not issue any form of full or partial refund.  They (maxcelltech1) offered a potential exchange, but could not find anything to exchange for it.....Poor quality phone.  I guess buyer should always beware and not assume that a phone listed as new in box is actually going to work as it is intended"	0
Horrible phone..Please do not buy. BEWARE!!! I have this phone now and it is nothing more than a fancy paper weight. It freezes when a text comes in and it takes forever for me to play music. The power shuts down a lot and I have to take the battery out and put it back in. Please don&apos;t let all the bells and whistles fool you.	0
horrible product. worst phone i have ever used in my life. can&apos;t do anything while on a phone call not even check your inbox. service on it sucks. everything about it is horrible. i now use it to prop open my window. if there was a 0 star option i would have used it.	0
"Horrible quality, laggy, crashes every six seconds. Worst purchase of my life. Customer service is non-existent, the item was so damaged I was surprised when it turned on my hopes quickly died as soon as the phone kept rebooting for no reason"	0
Horrible seller never got back to me this phone didnt work out of the box battery life was horrible condition of the phone was fair if that the phones back wouldnt stay on the phone was not compatible with man apps because it was so old and would not get phone calls or texts because of this isssue. I would never buy from this person again. wish ebay gave me my money back 	0
Horrible thsi phone is the definition of trash disgusting pop ups keeps coming up its slow and it wont even let you open an app without a crazy popup  	0

"How can you buy a cell phone and send it to you with a password, the camera does not work, the charging pin does not work, the Flash does not work and despite all that the package was to receive it on 11/6/18 and I received it on 11/20/18. nothing of the mentioned thing was described in the details of the article, it said to me that it works well which is not like that (IT IS A SCAM) I paid you almost US400 dollar And you sent me something that is useless"	0
HOW COULD I LIKE IT IF IT DIDN&apos;T EVEN TURN ON. IT;S IN THE TRASH.  I&apos;M VERY DISAPOINTED  WITH THIS PHONE	0
How do I get a refund?	0
how do I review the product if I haven&apos;t received it yet. I haven&apos;t received any response from the seller and  ebay can&apos;t even help me.    I will not order from ebay again if I don&apos;t get a refund from my order.	0
"how in the world you are going to sale a flip cellphone that doesn't cost more than $7 for over $200 what's wrong with ebay, why are you letting this person sale items so expensive like this one. need to go this is not right"	0
"Howdy,  this is a superb phone. I had an iphone before this, and honestly i like this more. I love the andriod OS, it&apos;s amazing. It takes some getting used to, but it&apos;s awesome once ya get the hang of it. The andriod market is great too, and most of the apps are free unlike the iphone appstore. The call quality and volume is good. It has a super display as well, things look sweet. The touch screen works well too. The phone build is nice too, has a sleek and funky look to it. On the whole, it&apos;s a great phone and you will LOVE it."	1
"HTC Evo is a great phone hands down. Best smart phone views and reviews beat iphone4 all who havea problem with Evo battery havent done research. Advance task killer, advandce Manager Killer, Juice Defender, all free apps battery just about doubles, but for those who question set both task killers to ignore each other and juice defender, and set auto kills to when screen is turned off and no delay time battery life will greatly increase"	1
"HTC T-Mobile MyTouch 3G is an outstanding product!  I wanted to be able to expand my communication options..and this is the phone for it! It&apos;s great to have WiFi on the phone too. I love to ease of operation..especially the ability to add free apps..to make the phone even more interesting.  I like email, weather, news, gas/price, mapping and shopping apps in particular.  I know most folks would like the bigger screens on the newer 4g&apos;s but I enjoy the more compact carry/use size.  Can&apos;t think of anything I don&apos;t like. I would buy again..will have a spare."	1
"HTC&apos;s One SV has arrived, and joins a plethora of above-average-spec handsets vying for your money. Available on Cricket in the US and EE in the UK, the 4.3-inch, LTE-ready device fits into the One series between the low-end V and, you guessed it, the better-equipped S. It&apos;s a curious release for HTC, given the One VX has just launched with almost identical specs, apart from the 4.5-inch, qHD (960 x 540) screen slightly besting that of the SV. Based on our quick hands-on time at CES, you may have already gathered that it&apos;s not a powerhouse built to wow you with raw benchmarks scores. But how, exactly, does it compare to its bigger brothers in the series? And, what does it offer people who are more concerned with their budget than 1080p displays or octo-core processors? Head beyond the fold for our full musings."	1
http://www.walmart.com/search/search-ng.do?search_query=Samsung+R355C&amp;ic=48_0&amp;Find=Find&amp;search_constraint=3944    U can buy this phone new for $75 and $30 for card makes it $105 but is NEW not REFURBISHED. Is only $15 more.	0
"Huge screen, quick processor (not like Huawei Ascend from Cricket/Metro PCs) and others. I would say this phone is at the level of the Dell Streak. Screen resolution is great. I am a very busy person so I only care about productivity and my calendar, tasks, etc are very quick and that is what i care the most. Very satisfied with it."	1
"I   love the phones, however neither worked. Sellers email not working. Ebay will not retutn my emails either."	0
"I  CANT  PROGRAM  IT,,,,,  ITS   TOO   HARD."	0
"I  don&apos;t like, because no has ship, I had mistake when bought, I don&apos;t see what was , other company no similar with the my . the my is AA&amp;T AND THIS COMPANY IS VIRAZON, for this I&apos;M dislike"	0
i  never recieved my phone i purchased it a week ago and i haven&apos;t got a tracking number or an email saying that my phone is being ship i would like file a complain.	0
"I  received notice from AT&amp;T that the phone I had would no longer be supported after 7/30/14.  I was using a cheap small phone after my original Pantech took a dive in some water.  I am so happy with this phone.  When I called AT&amp;T to find out if this one would be supported (they were trying to lock me into 2yrs and a smartphone) they weren&apos;t sure.  It works great, love the size of the keyboard and very sharp looking."	1
"I &apos;downgraded&quot; and bought this phone over a year ago because my &apos;newer&apos; bluetooth phone sounded so bad.  It has a great car kit.  Someone at Kyocera actually spent the necessary time to consider all the issues for a car kit!  Put the phone in its cradle and it charges it, and automatically hooks up to a microphone and speaker installed in my car.  Even turns off my car stereo when a call comes in.  Most importantly, it sounds great to both me and the person I am talking to.  I have had other car kits in the past, and none has sounded or worked as good as this one.  I am very happy with the phone both in and out of my car."	1
"I &quot;upgraded&quot; from the samsung moment to this phone.  I usually love samsung products but I can say that this phone falls short.  There are MANY glitches with the phone and in researching (After my purchase), I found that they are common issues.  I.e. the phone randomly turns off, it closes your programs immediately after you open them and also will &quot;discharge&quot; the battery when you plug it in to charge.    On the plus side I do like the new android set up that this phone offers.  But overall I miss my Moment."	0

I absolutely love and would buy from seller again	1
I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE the S6 Edge+ 	1
"I absolutely love my LG VX7000 camera/video phone. It is so easy to customize to my personal style! You can preview and download ringtones right off the handset and program them for each person. You can program every single ring on the phone, so there is a different ringer for each person and each text message. Not all phones let you program text ringers on each person, most phones just let you program a ringtone for all text messages. The video on the phone only records 15 seconds, but sometimes that&apos;s all you need. The camera has flash, not that it helps much. I had my first LG VX7000 for a year and a half and never had any problems at all. When it was stolen, I purchased a new one off Ebay and paid $50 extra for overnight shipping. 11 days later, (after a paypal dispute with the seller) I finally got the phone. It broke within a few days, which is NOT normal for these phones. I had to buy another phone, but it has been great!! I definitely love this phone, I would hate to give it up!!!"	1
I absolutely love the Motorola RAZR it is an awesome phone with great functions and it is easy to use. I have had many other phones but none compare to this phone.	1
"I absolutely love the way this auction went, not just because of the item, but because of the easiness of the transaction, shipment and all. i would definitely see myself buying from this seller, OFTEN...."	1
"I absolutely love this phone and I might have preference because I upgraded from a Galaxy S5 mini. However, the display is stunning compared to lesser generations from all companies. The battery life gets me through the day and more, it gets through intense gaming (Hearthstone takes a lot to run on a phone), YouTube videos, and lots of Snap-chatting. The phones back camera is great especially with the software upgrades such as HDR, but it has 12 megapixels (MPs) compared to the S6's 16 MPs. The front facing camera, however, has gotten an upgrade from both the S6's and S7's 5 MPs up to 8 MPs. Another notable feature would be the virtual buttons on the bottom of the screen which allow for the display to flow through it. Lastly would be the finger print scanner on the back of the phone, I love the placement of it, but that might be just me. In all, I think it is a great phone, but there are only a few differences that set it apart from the S7. If you are on a bit of a budget go for the S7, but if you want a better selfie camera and display -- along with the usual battery and processor improvements -- go for the S8."	1
"I absolutely love this phone! It came in perfect condition, exactly like the picture and with all the things (like the headphones, charger ect.) that were listed! Great seller! :)"	1
I absolutely love this phone! The screen is so clear. The batter last a day and a half which is awesome. And the camera is great! 	1
"i absolutely love this phone.  the transaction went well.  the seller was great.  i had a few problems activating this phone, but the seller was right there with me all the way thru it.  all in all im very pleased."	1
I absolutely love this phone. It&apos;s simple and easy to use-a great value for my money. No data plan to pay for and easy to to text on. I&apos;m partial towards motorolas and this phone has is in very good shape for its age. Couldn&apos;t ask for anything better.	1
"i absolutely loved the phone but not the fact that it didn&apos;t work.  i received the phone and realized it didn&apos;t work i charged it for 2 days and nothing!!! it was my first and last time i purchase something from eBay, i returned the phone back to its owner hoping that i would receive my money back, it&apos;s been almost 2 months that have past and i haven&apos;t received anything. NEVer AGAIN!!!!!"	0
"I accidentally left my original cell phone in my pants pocket when I was placing clothes in the pile to be washed.  Needless to say, after my clothes made it thru a full wash and then were placed into the dryer, I was hearing some &apos;clunking&apos; around my dryer... oops!  Cell phone shot.  I searched ebay and found my same exact phone (make and model) though slightly used I didn&apos;t care, and ordered it for the lowest price compared to other sellers.  I was concerned about the ESN number of the phone, but all sellers ensured that the ESN number was good and there would be no issue upon reactivation with my carrier.  I got the replacement phone in record time through the mail and didn&apos;t have to worry about the replacement program that my cell company was attempting to offer me nor worried about renewals of contracts.  This replacement phone works fine - as expected - and now I can take my time shopping for a new plan, or just might keep going month to month.  Thanks for the quick turnaround!"	1
"I activated the phone as soon as I receieved it.  I tried to download some music to my phone but it cited an error.  I called Verizon only to find out that Samsung had updated the software to the Gleam because of problems with the applications.  If you buy a phone that was not active at the time they updated this application, then your phone was not updated and could never be updated.  I returned the phone for a totally different one.  I would not recommend buying a new Samsung Gleam.  A used one might be okay if you can find one that works with the applications features."	0
"I actually had the HTC one M8. So I am able to give an accurate review of this product. Speed wise you can't tell any difference. The processor is almost the same as the M8. So it is made for speed. It only has 16 gb of ram built into it vs the 32 of the M8. Get yourself a Microsdram card and put any extra apps on it and it should be fine. It allows up to 128 gb . Believe it or not the sound is even louder than the HTC one M8. Amazing with the 2 forward speakers. It is by far the loudest smartphone I have ever owned. I ownly paid 76 dollars for this phone used . It comes with a quad core 2.0 cpu and is meant for speed. Mine is white with a plastic shell vs the M8 metal shell. I actually like the plastic better. It seems more modern. For 76 to a 100 dollars you're getting one of the best used phones for the money. , in my book. The only con ; It can only go as high as Marshmallow Android. Forget loading the new Nougat Android. "	1
"I actually purchased this as a Christmas gift for my 25-year old daughter. In the process of configuring it, I was very impressed with the styling, quality and numerous features that it provides for the price. I can&apos;t rate in regard to day-to-day use, but I think it will be very easy to use and provide years of good service."	1
I advise everyone not to contact this seller because he does not fulfill his requirements.	0
I ALMOST DIDN&apos;T GET MY MONEY BACK ON THIS IT HAD TO MUCH DAMAGE ON IT HAD TO PART OUT. TO BREAK EVEN.	0
I already bought that product and did not send it to me and plans to sell it again	0
"I already email you several times you did not answer my email and you ask me for a review it is bad business practice. I am waiting to return the phone it does not work after taking several phone company I decide to take it to Microsoft store they checked it without going in detail they told me it was defective I told them I will return it they agreed with me.   I am not happy the way you treated me it is not acceptable in a business practice the government should check or investigate your business practice, you should check if the product is real or not legally you cannot distribute or advertise as a Knew product or as original factory when it is not.  I think I will inform Nokia If they can verify this phone with IMEI Number 35726405018658 if it is factory phone or not.  Thank you   S.A "	0

"I always buy phones on eBay, and this phone was a great price but the discription is way off. There is nothing new about this phone. It was all chewed up around the charger port and it looked like the phone had been dropped several times. There was also a crack in the glass by the camara shutter! "	0
I Always wanted a Sony cell phone which I could remote play my PS4 easily and liste to music to it's full potential. The battery life is not that great tho for what i'm doing with it but if your the type of person which does not surf a lot it's good. Plus the super-vivid contrast is awesome. I'll stick with this phone for years that's for sure. 	1
i always wanted to bay a touchscreen phone but i dint like them because when i text or write something the letters get mixed up. then this phone came out it has a touch screen like i phone but it also has a keybord its the best phone ever its really fast with the web if you getsick of touch screen i would till you this is the one to chose	1
"I am a Blackberry user even though I have a Droid, the blackberry was designed with the business class in mind and still allowed us to have fun with the phone.The many applications makes whatever you need to do with this phone an easy snap."	1
"I am a former user of the Note Edge and when my S8+ broke, I decided to go back to the Note Edge.  I willingly paid more on eBay for a ""new"" phone as I did not want anything refurbished.  This particular Note Edge was advertised as new at the time of purchase, however it is not new.    1.  The phone did not come in the original box. 2.  The battery did not hold a charge.  It could be the original, but I'd think if it'd never been used, it'd hold a charge.  I had to buy new ones. 3.  If you are in a quiet place and press on the screen (with the power off), you'll hear the screen crackling.   4.  There is a lack of response when pressing on the icons and such.    Everything indicates to me this is refurbished and probably with cheap knock-off parts.   The seller figures we probably won't be able to tell the difference, but I surely hope others read this review before purchasing this phone, because it's not new.  What I aim to do is take apart my older Note Edge and compare the parts to see if I can prove that the phone has been rebuilt.  I'm quite sure I'm right just because of how the phone feels when I press on the screen, and how non-responsive it is.   I mean, how many of these phones does this guy (company) have and where'd they get them all?  Did they buy a whole bunch new an"	0
I am a hugh Nokia fan.  The whole family has Nokia phones.  I bought mom a Nokia 2330 but she wanted a flip phone. She did not want to lock the keys and kept purse dialing.     She wanted a flip so I got her the 2720.  The volume just is not loud enough. Mom who wears a hearing aid.  She really does not like the phone.  The ringer and phone volume are not loud enough for her. I have tried the phone an must agree the phone lacks volume. She was happier with her 2330.	0
I am a Samsung fan but grandson loves it.	1
"I am a very upset customer this phone had no charger and no sim card and when I just was going to let that slide, I went to active the phone and the phone is reported lost and now I can not active this phone. I contacted the seller when the phone took forever to come the first time, then I contacted him about the charger and the sim card no reply and now about the lost states that is on the phone. to say I am upset will be an understatement."	0
"I am afraid it did not work,  the signal was ok in the same house when we tried it but my partner was using it for work and the signal was very poor and no one could get through to him or when they did could not hear him.Had to go and buy a new one in the end."	0
"I am an LG fan anyway, but I was not so thrilled with my LG Leon.  I compared this phone with the Leon and it is a definite step up.  When I read the reviews on this phone, they said that it wasn't the highest end phone you could get but was worth the price.  I find that it's definitely worth the price - it is better in speed and has double the memory that my old phone had.  It also has an auto-focus camera, which to me is very important because I read QR codes frequently.  Before this phone I was not able to find an auto-focus on a phone without paying a big price.  This phone is just a tad bigger than I'm used to, but definitely not worth complaining about.   Absolutely pleased with this phone!"	1
i am angry because it was not working and told it was also it has a cracked screen and scratched all over	0
"I am compleately satisfied from the phone till now.No problems at all!!!Price,quality and service were just perfect!"	1
I am confortable with it...	1
I am delighted with my IPhone 5. It is  in excellent condition and everything the ad said it would be. And they were also kind enough to even include a charge and a case. Happy me!	1
"I am disappointed that the item turned out to be a FAKE. Also e-Bay collected the money even prior to delivery. Even when the device has been received and acknowledged such by the Seller, I still have not received my refund. e-Bay policy of Refund - Buyer Protection needs to be revisited. I can understand a three day period needed to effect the refund, and I do not know if I will continue browsing thru e-bay for any items."	0

"I am enjoying my phone, the appearance,accessories and features. The delivery time was appropriate and the price was great. I decided to look for and purchase this phone on ebay due to my phone had broken and I did not want to pay full price for a phone from my provider."	1
"I am extremely disappointed in this phone. I &quot;upgraded&quot; to the a777 from the a707, which is an excellent phone, I have owned 2 of them. Unfortunately the a777 doesn&apos;t meet the high quality I&apos;ve come to expect from Samsung phones.     First, battery life is terrible. If you do any texting at all, or routinely use the speakerphone on calls, which I do because I&apos;m hard of hearing, the battery life is extremely short.   Second, the keyboard is somewhat slick and the keys are spaced very close together so it&apos;s hard to text just by feeling the position of the keys, you have to actually look at the keys when you&apos;re texting. The phone is small and not ergonomically shaped at all so texting cramps the hand.   Third, the slider mechanism of the keyboard becomes loose rather quickly.    It is nice that the phone has XM radio capability and nice music features but this really doesn&apos;t matter due to the short life of the battery. I&apos;d love to be able to listen to music on it at work but the battery dies too fast.     Overall a great disappointment from Samsung. Think carefully before you fork out extortion money to AT&amp;T for this phone."	0
"I am fan from windows phone but the Samsung S4 is amazing, i like the features, the size, gaming graphics, very beautiful display. The camera is excellent, great value for the phone. A great christmas gift."	1

"I am going to link the review of this phone to Ebay that allows fake, refurbished phones from China to be sold on it&apos;s website and to seller bluecn0755 who sells this phone. DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE FROM THIS SELLER. The phone did not work, and seller refused to refund the return shipping costs, until I changed negative feedback to positive. SHAME ON YOU bluecn0755, and SHAME ON YOU Ebay for not protecting your customers from FRAUD."	0
i am happy that i was able to finally find a red sony ericson at a good price. i just received the phone and i already love playing with it....thanks so much	1
"I am having a great time with this phone. So much better than iPhone 5S. Got from eBay seller and it was mint. But not advertised as new. No dings and an ""after market"" charger though I have headphones and it was a super sweet price. I'm coming back to EBay for my phones!"	1
I am having a lot of trouble with this seller. I would never recomend this seller nor his product to any of my friends.He is giving me a hard time to have a simple phone shipped to me.	0
"i am Htc user for a long time, you get a nice phone for a decent money, this one is wonderful, many fixtures for less money, highly recommended phone, i love the sealed boxes, you buy with confidence, A9 is fast, light, nice looking, low price, many nice fixtures and long lasting battery."	1
"I am impressed. I wanted a phone with a great camera and this phone does not disappoint. Full auto or full manual, normal or wide angle, panoramas and 4K video. WiFi is quick to find and use as well as the Bluetooth. Very easy to use and setup. Great call sound! I was very surprised when I got my first call. It was like they were standing right beside me, actually better then beside me. "	1
"I am in the cell phone business and have been for a long time, this phone was one of Motorola&apos;s best. I really think that in the Razr Magenta Pink, it looks better than the Razr and you can get it at half the price. Search for it under &quot;T731 Magenta&quot; or &quot;T730 Magenta&quot; there should be a few for sale and see if you agree.     This phone replaced the Motorola T720c and improved some of the issues with that phone. It&apos;s menu navigation doesn&apos;t lag and it has better battery life. You should get one with a new battery, this phone has a large color screen and can drain old batteries.     It has Large Lit keys which makes it easy to operate for people with big fingers, and to see them at night. The whole key pad lights up, not just the numbers and letters.     The Screen is very large and it is easy to see the number you dialed displayed on the screen.     Motorola is known for great reception and this phone has excellent reception.     The only down side is there is no camera built in, otherwise, I really like the style of this phone, especially in Magenta.

"I am not sure about battery life because I am using it more now to get up to speed with it. And my so now my battery needs charging more than once a day. Even with that it seems to last longer than my iPhone, that is 3-4 years old. Only time will tell."	1
I am older and don&apos;t care for extra wolfs and whistles or high tech.  I was just looking for a basic phone that is easy to use.  This is the one.  I like the size too as it fits easily in my pocket or purse.	1
"I am on my third one and it is broken also.  Service is great and push to talk is awesome.  But Lg need to go back to the drawing board on thier durability factor!!!  Also, if you carry in purse or pocket, the side buttons turn features on and off without you knowing it."	0
I am pleased with my phone. Nice doing business with you all. I would recommend this website to my friends.	1
"I am really disappointed with this purchase, both with seller and with EBay. The product was advertised as Brand New in the box iphone. I received the phone one week after buying it and it was NOT original. You could tell just for the feel and look. Very poor imitation. I complain with ebay and ebay rejected my complain arguing that I have never shipped back the item. But they never told me what should I do!!! Really poor customer service. With this decission ebay is supporting and encouraging this sellers to keep selling fake products. TERRIBLE!!! Don&apos;t buy from this seller and don&apos;t believe the &quot;ebay buyer protection&quot; advertised buy their CEO on the starting page."	0

I am really impressed with this phone.  It was advertised as in excellent condition and it is. Nice to have a really good phone at a really decent price.	1
"I am rescinding my original review. This phone teases you with its 64 bit octacore processor, 16mp camera, and 3gb of RAM, but it's terrible. It randomly loses application data (apps occasionally start as if they'd just been installed). If you want notifications or accessibility services enabled for an app, you have to lock it so the phone doesn't close it. You have to explicitly allow apps (such as add-ons to other apps and apps that run in the background like Tasker (as examples, Tasker won't perform tasks and Greenify's paid features won't work without this)) to start automatically or they won't work. There's no Google calendar support. No way to directly access Google Settings out of the box. The power button is on the side near the middle--the perfect place for you to accidentally shut off your phone by holding the button for 10+ second. The camera sucks if the subject isn't less than two feet away. The screen randomly shuts off. It's dual SIM, but if you want to use two SIM cards, you can't use an sdcard--it's either two SIM cards or one SIM card and one sdcard. It doesn't have NFC. Netflix works fine, but you can't install it from the Play Store (though that may be a Netflix issue)."	0
i am satisfied with the purchase i made!!!!!! This phone is a gift to my younger sister and i am happy i found this phone in a affordable price!!	1
I am severly disappointed in the Dell Aero phone.  It boasted a 5 MP camera but takes pictures worse than any camera I have ever seen.  Crappy crappy photos.  Don&apos;t even try to use wi-fi on it.. can&apos;t get any good android apps either.  seems like this phone was made in the 80&apos;s it&apos;s so bad.  Please don&apos;t buy it.  I wish I hadn&apos;t.  Saving up for a real phone!	0

I am the kind of person who goes through phones every 3 months. Until now. The slvr has got to be the best phone on the market. The quality of the phone compared to any other is incrediable. Also a big key to getting a good working phone is to NEVER get an unlocked phone. If you have Cingular stick with a Cingular phone. If you have Sprint stick with a Sprint phone ect. For all Cingular customers this phone will serve it&apos;s purpose plus some.	1
I am totally upset about my purchase of the Motorola T720. I used it for less than two weeks and the hinge broke which made it non working. The 7 day warranty had expired so I am stuck with no phone and out $41.00. This has turned me sour about using ebay to purchase items.	0

I am warning you. Please Do NOT buy from this seller unless you are planing on getting scam.

"I and a few friends have been using this phone for years.  We love it.  Small, elegant, metal case, easy to use.  It is perfect for voice and text.  None of us use it for Wi-Fi or Bluetooth; the screen is small.  The only occasionally negative reviews suggest the touchscreen is fragile.  I broke mine after 4 years.  So, I ordered a new phone, and 2 replacement touchscreens at 9 bucks each, and 2 replacement batteries at 5 bucks each.  I'm all set."	1
"I apologize but Great Call informed me that three of their  Jitterbug phones are now obsolete, and the Jitterbug J is one  of them. The phone can no longer be activated. So I purchased  a phone that I can never use."	0
I appreciate TRUTH and this person told the truth.  My child lost their NEW Virgin Mobile Wildcard and I initially refused to pay the steep price that it was - once again.  Boy was I joyed to see one for half the price.  Thanks for describing the item to the tee.!!!!Good selling	1
"I asked a question before bidding would the HANDS FREE EAR PIECE work with my Samsung X495 - the seller said it would so I placed a bid for his Item - it doesn&apos;t work on my phone and I want a full refund.     As a seller &amp; buyer with a 98.7% rating - I realize it is difficult to please everyone - this seller needs to bite the bullet, take back the item &amp; offer the refund &amp; he&apos;s not willing too?"	0
I asked for direct information and until today I did not have a return.	0
I asked if there was anything  wrong with the phone there were no actual  photos of the phone and there are ghost icons on the display screen I wouldn't  have bought it if I knew that was the condition. The seller didn't provide that information up front. 	0
"I asked the seller for a refund the same day my daughter purchased the item without my consent & he ignored me & didn't respond until the next to let me know that they were shipping the item anyway. Then after they shipped it they wrote me a message telling me to return the item for a refund, & I'm like why did you send the item in the first place if I asked to cancel the purchase literally minutes after my daughter purchased it"	0
"I asked the seller specifically if this phone worked with AT&amp;T. The seller stated that the phone had been tested with an AT&amp;T sim card. When I received the phone, it showed that I had no network service available. I contacted AT&amp;T customer service support. They stated that the phone I purchased will not work with AT&amp;T. I am very unsatisfied with the sellers lack of cooperation in resolving this matter. I am also upset that the seller lied to me to get me to purchase the phone. I will NEVER recommend this seller, if anything I would recommend not purchasing anything this seller has to offer. An untruthful seller is not a person you want to purchase an item from!!!!!"	0
"I asked this seller if I would encounter any problems activating this phone and I was told there wouldn't be. I g to the Sprint store to activate it and was told the phone was stolen. When I told them how much I bought it for, I was told that's typically how much DEMO phones are worth.   DO NOT trust this seller. "	0

"I bidded and won a Samsung SCH-450 Messenger Phone from Revived Cellular Technology for $50.00, This company should be put out of business. I am VERY dis-satified with this phone. The screen is so scratched up it&apos;s like looking thru a pair of bi-focal glasses. The phone is missing buttons, not only does the phone have scratches, it has dents all over of it. This companys mislead me when they said it had a few scratches and MINOR wear, That&apos;s a bald face lie. This phone should have gone in the trash, but this company Revived sold is this phone to a customer. You people should be ashamed of the type of business you&apos;re running, and the kind of product you&apos;re selling customers. I am so angry I don&apos;t know what to do."	0
"I bot this Cricket Samsung as a backup since I already had a new one just like it. I was very pleased in the condition of this phone as it was very clean and the price was great. It is just a very basic phone, nothing fancy like some of the higher priced phones, but it&apos;s what I needed. Very pleased with the product and the price."	1
"I bough this phone and the seller said it was in completely functional conditioning. Unfortunately, they lied. The phone works occasionally and the screen doesnt work when you press it which makes it very hard to type a message or do anything. I messaged this seller and they wont let me return it.   DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS SELLER!!"	0

I bought 2 cellphones from this seller but they were not unlocked as advertised. When I contacted the seller just to ask why they were not unlocked the replied was They were unlocked when we had them unbelievable; in other words he suggested we tempered with the devices like we are technology savvies. I just bought them to my nieces who has not clues about blocking devices. 	0
"I bought 2 LG L63BL to use them in the Dominican Republic, the phones I tried to release them for my country and even now it seems impossible, the phone has the room modified by tracfone, the phone does not ask for unlocked pim as the phones of at & t, cricket, Verizon, and does not have any applications available as the device unlock MetroPCS or T-Mobile to release them, I feel that I lost my money to make this purchase, and the worst thing is that the phone I really like the truth is a shame .  compre 2 LG L63BL para usarlos en Republica Dominicana, Los telefonos he intentado liberarlos para mi pais y hasta a ahora parece algo imposible, el telefono tiene la room modificada por tracfone, el movil no pide pim de desbloqueo como los telefonos de at&t, cricket, Verizon, y no tiene ninguna aplicacion disponible como la device unlock  de MetroPCS o T-Mobile para poder liberarlos, siento que he perdido mi dinero al hacer esta compra, y lo peor de todo es que el telefono me gusta mucho la verdad es una lastima."	0

"I bought a cell phone from this seller who stated that the phone was brand new and that he had only used it for two months and he switched carriers so he no longer needed it. Well, I went to activate the phone  at the Sprint store to find out the phone is still linked to another account and therefore they are unable to activate it and that there has been water damage to the phone. Plus, It took over a week and a half to receive the phone that I cannot use. I emailed the person twice afterward asking him to take the phone off of his account and or refund me and needless to say there has been no response. I would NEVER buy anything from this seller again!!!! I was completely scammed!!!"	0
"i bought a cell phone that was displayed with many accesories. all i recieved was a charger and a phone. he refused to overnight the battery which is essential to opperate a cell phone. i also told him the other items could come at a normal rate of postage, he agein, refused and told me to send the phone back. i actually like the phone so i bought a new battery on ebay from another seller. why would you sell a phone with no battery, it&apos;s so f-ing dumb. he said he would pay for my battery on ebay, but with this track record i ate the ten dollars. his pics were false and his integrity was lost with it. i do not understand why he has such a high rating. why would i eat the cost of another persons discretion, this is the first negative response i have written, and i hope it&apos;s my last. a simple solution of sending a battery asap turned into too much cost for him. it wasn&apos;t just the battery and a car charger and some other stuff. like i said to him, &quot;the phone is useless without a battery, i do not care about any other thing.&quot; please second guess this seller, why would i pay shipping back to him when he dismissed a simple request."	0

I bought a iPhone 6s from this seller some weeks ago.  After waiting for almost 2 weeks I finally got a delivered notification on my eBay platform but the phone never came.  After sending him several mails he refused to reply.  All he keep saying was that he sent the phone and it was delivered.  I started blaming the post office.  After proper investigations by the post office they found out that the tracking number he gave me was also used to send an item to another person.   So he gave me a tracking number that was used to send an item to someone else and I have no idea how he manipulated it.  That item was delivered to that person while it was showing delivered on My platform on eBay.  Till now he had refused to reply my emails.  Usps even gave me the receipt he used to send the mail.   So his a fraud.  And I hope you burn in Hell for defrauding me.   Im already taking it up with the police.  	0
"I bought a kx12 for its&apos; supposed ruggedness. What a mistake it was. Almost from the start I had problems with it shutting itself off. Not often at first, but as time went on, it got to be a real problem. Hit the send key, nothing would happen because it had shut itself off. Other times it would shut off while not being used. It also had a bad habit of cutting off calls when you tried to answer them. The vibrate mode was almost useless as it was usally not noticable. The phone has a bunch of ring tones built into it, but most are useless as they can&apos;t be heard under normal circumstances as the ringer volumne is way to low. The speakerphone sometimes was almost impossible to turn off once it was turned on. This was a real problem if it got turned on accidently. The speakerphone worked well if it was functioning properly though. The looks of the phone are not pretty, but I bought it because it was supposed to be rugged. When I sent it in, they said the circuit board was cracked and wouldn&apos;t be covered by warranty. The phone had not been abused, so much for rugged part. I didn&apos;t even inquire as to the cost of fixing it. I just told them to send it back that way as I didn&apos;t feel it was worth fixing. After reading some other users&apos; reviews of this turkey, I realized even if they fixed it, I still wouldn&apos;t have a phone that would work to satifaction. I will replace it with something else. And this time I&apos;m checking reviews first, not after the fact. Avoid this phone like the plague!"	0

Eventually it worked after rebooting. then one day, it wouldnt turn on again, and Every combination of vol down and power, vol up +home +power, etc was tried but to no avail.

I bought a note 4 from this seller and was in the listing there was a small scratch on the screen so I asked specifically if a glass screen protector would go on without a bubble and no matter what you can't get the bubble out of the middle of the screen because the light scratching is gouges in the middle of the screen so I now have a 200 dollar  phone that I can't put a screen protector on.	0
I bought a phone and Seller sent it to an unknown address in a different state not the address on my order.

"I bought a Samsung Intercept from this seller.  In the description, he stated that there was a &quot;bad spot&quot; in the top right hand corner of the phone.  When I received the item, there was a crack on the inside of the LCD screen that went from the top right hand corner to the middle of the left hand side of the phone.  When I emailed him about it, he responded with a detailed discription of how the &quot;bad spot&quot; happened saying that it had been dropped and that is what caused that &quot;bad spot.&quot; That discription would have been nice when he was selling the item.  The screen was damaged and wouldn&apos;t allow you to see the screen on any and all parts that the &quot;bad spot&quot; touched.  The seller also didn&apos;t seem to want to resolve the matter with me at all so I had to file a claim with ebay protection.  I&apos;m using my husbands ebay account and am somewhat new to ebay.  I was very disappointed in the undetailed discription that let me to believe the phone was in good condition."	0

After three years, the batteries still carriy a 4-day charge (down from 6) and they work great on the AT&amp;T Wireless / Cingular / back to AT&amp;T Wireless network.  The only thing that is not up to date is the lack of a mini SD card slot (can not increase storage), and does not take video (only pictures).  Other than that it is a great phone, and with the data cable and supplied software you can sync with your computer.  Also you can surf the internet / text message / e-mail / instant messenger."	1

I bought for my kids to use as an iPod but I didnt realize what the software 7 version meant. The seller did I guarantee it. It means it isnt supported anymore. You cant download any apps to it. They mostly all require iOS 9 or higher. This phone shouldnt be sold to anyone  and the fact that the seller doesnt accept returns shows that he knows hes selling a useless piece of equipment. 	0

i bought from this supposed place thinking my phone was going to be useable when this company or person or persons knew that it was not scanned or useable but sold the product anyway and refuse returns. I think this sounds fraudulent and the phone devices might be stolen. I do not know for sure. I never ever want to deal with a company like this who sells people stuff that is messed up or not functioning at all brand new or not. You knew this and still sold it to people. This is wrong and scandolous and you should be dealt with.  Scamming people is wrong and selling them products that they cannot use is messed up. The product was brand new but you cannot use it. The intended use for this product is to make calls not emails and a dead paper weight. Very unsatisfied and feel cheated out of money i deserve to get back. Even if you described it as not been scanned it sounds suspicious and untrustworthy. If this is how a business is run. Consider the better business bureau and others getting involved so stop selling things that cannot be used or damaged period. 	0

"I bought it out of necessity.  I have been diagnosed with cancer of the tongue and am about to have surgery which will remove at least 50% of my tongue, all my teeth and all the limp nodes in my throat.  I will have a tube out of my throat to breath and a tube down my nose to my stomach to receive nourishment so I&apos;m not going to be talking for awhile.  Text-messaging and e-mail are going to be my only form of communication I&apos;ll have for awhile and everything I have read about the Q&apos;s performance and knowing there is no better brand than Motorola I chose the Motorola Q. My mistake was buying used from an individual instead of buying new or at least refurbished by a dealer with a good track record.  I think a new one would work like a dream and be everything most people would ever need.  The only suggestion I have is Motorola should design a stylus especially to fit the small buttons on the Q and it would be perfect."	0
"I bought it to play music in my shop via my WIFI.  It does work, but some of the apps I wanted are  incompatible, plus the ones that do work keep stopping and having to be restarted.

Then I tried to go to the seller&apos;s ebay store to contact them and their store did not exist! I have written that I want a return and still have not heard from Wireless Bliss.

I would NEVER buy off them again and i recommend you dont either. DOnt make the same mistake i did."	0

"I bought NEW LG COOKIE PINK UNLOCKED T-MOBILE TOUCH PHONE KP500 on May 16. The phone didn&apos;t work with missing accesorries so contacted seller but seller&apos;s respond was terribly slow. Finally got an exchange on June 6 but the phone was BLACK where I ordered PINK and the phone didn&apos;t work either. Sent a lot of emails with complaints but still terrible communications. Told me they will call but never did. The seller left me no choice but had to request for refund and leave negative feedback.     If the product works from the first place, it would be no problem. But once you have a problem, you will find VERY DIFFICULT to resolve the problem. Not recommend to buy product from this seller."	0

"I bought one of the T39m&apos;s sold from Hong Kong around 2007-01-01.  I&apos;ve never owned a so-called real T39m, but I don&apos;t see obvious problems with fabrication quality, and it does find the network and have decent reception.  There are stories on the web about poor reliability of T28 and T39m when they were originally sold, and also it sounds like Ericsson&apos;s repair shop in the old days was thoroughly incompetent, frustrating lots of people.      And if it&apos;s true these are ``fake&apos;&apos; chinese phones, clearly they have access to Ericsson&apos;s software and production lines, so much of what once made these phones so amazing is still there.  but...I doubt the story.  My phone came with R2G firmware (press &gt;*&lt;&lt;*&lt;*), and the latest is R4A or R4B.  Wouldn&apos;t a ``fake&apos;&apos; phone use the latest firmware?  secondly, the KRC code at the top of my sticker, ``KRC 114 1425&apos;&apos;, 114 is a phone originally sold SIM-locked in Thailand.  so I guess they are using plausibly-fake serial number stickers, too?  no, it&apos;s too congruent.    _THAT SAID_, the microphone is too quiet.  The other party always complains.  It is such a big problem I have switched back to my T28.  It&apos;s a show-stopper for someone who&apos;s buying a phone like this---someone who wants ``a phone that&apos;s just a phone, but a damn good one.&apos;&apos;  And this is suspicious, because the T28 has the same microphone exactly.  In fact, I thought ``maybe it is a chinese case but Ericsson guts, and the microphone is part of the case, so they substituted some arbitrary garbage like they always do.&apos;&apos;  I swapped the microphone for one removed from the flip of a genuine T28.  still quiet.  Maybe they corrupted some audio calibration while unlocking it?    Second, the Bluetooth doesn&apos;t work.  At first I thought it was just some ``profile compatibility&apos;&apos; garbage because I was trying laptops or crappy Motorola headsets, but I bought an Ericsson CAR-100 which is definitely on the compatibility list, and it won&apos;t pair.  I have no idea how they managed to break the Bluetooth.  (yes, the AVR and ARM firmwares do match.)    so.  in short, there are a lot of wild rumors and a lot of Chinese-hating flying around about this latest batch of suspicious T39m&apos;s.  I think the speculation is largely just silly.  However, I still wonder where so many are coming from!  And AFAICT there are real, show-stopping problems with this batch of T39m&apos;s (unless they all had much worse microphones than the T28 and fantasy-bluetooth only).  sorry."	0

I bought one of these phones for my daughter for Christmas and it was dead within 5 months. My daughter wanted another one just like it and I found on on ebay for a reasonable price. The second phone died just over a month. Please don&apos;t waste your money on this phone. My daughter had it in a hard plastic case at all times.	0
"I bought one of this Note 4  The Note 4 I got was refurbished !!! With the app ""Phone INFO *Samsung*"" from Vndnguyen you can do a ""Refurbishment Check"" it say about my phone: ""WARNING: Manufacturing Date does not match with the Serial Number"" + Marshmallow was installed = Did not exist when this phone was manufactured !!  Incorrectness with my Note 4: # Phone box was wrapped in shrink plastic = Never have my earlier bought Samsung phones here in Sweden had shrink plastic around the box  The box security seals ( from Samsung ?) was not broken = The seller replied to me they always check the phones so they are okey before they ship them = So the seller have authorization/permission from Samsung to mount new security seals and, after that, shrink plastic the box ? + The box outer middle stripe should correspond to phones color my Black phone should have a Black striped box, it have a White striped box !!  Inside the box = Charger was not a fast charger !! = This was a big selling point with this phone !! + The earphones had the worst sound quality I have heard since the 70's !! + The left earphone have a loose part inside that rattles + No different sizes silicon plugs was included so the earphones does not stay in my ears !! + The tool and extra tip for the S-Pen was not included"	0

"I bought the 32 GB version because I needed more space when I used to have the 16 GB version, even with an SD card in it.  Some apps do not have the ability to keep their data on the added SD card.  This 32 GB version is very useful for this reason.  The S4 works very quickly compared to my previous phone, the Galaxy Lite."	1

I bought the cingular 1300 cell phone because my husband wanted a phone that he could flip open to answer and close to disconnect.  I had the same phone and he liked it.  Easy to use and not too large to put in pocket or purse.	1
"I bought the DROID Bionic as a replacement for my HTC Thunderbolt which bit the dust after falling out of my pocket (RIP, lil&amp;apos; bolt). The battery life was a pleasant surprise, lasting a full day of heavy use. I also bought the extended battery, but I haven&amp;apos;t even had to use it yet.    The pre-installed Verizon crapware is annoying. No one wants or needs the bloat, and I wish VZW would quit sullying their beautiful phones with junk that non-rooted users can&amp;apos;t uninstall. It is just making me want to root even more badly."	1

"I bought the LG for my son. The first phone that I received didn&apos;t work. I asked for a replacement and received one. The phone has been okay--not great. But, it does work.

"I bought the Motorola i860 Sprint Phone as a Chrostmas gift for my husband.  It arrived in early January 2011.  Although the phone has great features such as camera, video camera, and speakerphone, etc, it&apos;s batter lifespan is not very good.  If it is left one all day, even if not used, it generally requires charging every 24 hours.  However, even worse than that is that we bought it for it&apos;s supposed ruggedness and in less than two weeks, the screen on the phone quit working.  The display is like looking at a cracked mirror.  The advertisement for the phone leads one to believe it to be similar to the Timex watch whose saying is &quot;It takes a licking but keeos on ticking&quot;.  My husband dropped this phone on our dirt driveway, and this was the result.  Ebven his old Motorola took more of a lickoing than this one.  This phone is definitely &quot;cracked up&quot; and not as durable as advertised."	0
"I bought the Motorola Rival A455 for my son because of the brand, color, features and design. The phone was inexpensive and I guess you get what you pay for because within a month the screen stopped working but it was still under warranty, so we tried again.  The screen on the second phone lasted just enough longer to be out of warranty.  It&apos;s a sharp looking little phone but poorly built.  I won&apos;t go for a third try."	0

"I bought the original at a ATT store about 6 months ago but jumped in the lake with it last month. ATT has stopped selling it and Samsung does not make that model anymore.  I don&apos;t want to learn to use another phone because I liked the A517.  I use the memory card for my music when I work out and the speaker is ok for just listening in a quiet place.  So EBAY came to the rescue and I was able to get one without any hassles within a week.  BTW, I was able to save all my numbers on the sim card so always save your numbers there instead of on the phone."	1

It turns off and on all by itself, the volume button does not work, there were scratches that were not described on phone. THE PHONE WAS DAMAGED AND IN BAD WORKING CONDITION.

"I bought the phone because I was unfamiliar with androids, and this phone was the least expensive.  It is a great little starter phone for anyone who has never had an android.  Everything is easy to use and figure out, but I don&apos;t like the fact there is no instrucion book so you have to go online to check out the features.  However, it seems to be the trend now to not have instruction books included, so this is still a great phone for the money."	1

"I bought the Samsung Epic 3G Galaxy about a weeks ago and I was impressed with the numerous features available on this phone.  The camera is very clear, the speakerphone works very well, and you can be heard perfectly by the person you&apos;re talking to.  The Phone is a good size in general, but can take some getting use to when it&apos;s in your pocket cause it&apos;s a little bulkier than your average phone.  The battery power lasts pretty long, but be sure to shut off the GPS and/or Wi-FI if you&apos;re not using it cause it can drain the battery faster, but the lifespan is pretty good.  Ultimately, the phone is the best phone I&apos;ve ever had and have no complaints after a week and usually I find something I don&apos;t like about my phones after a few days.  Great Phone."	1
"I bought the Samsung propel 763  about a month ago and was very disappointed. It came locked to AT&amp;T , I got the unlocked code and tried to open it and it phone freezed. I called samsung to tried and rectify the problem and they told me that the phone was locked by the carrier so I would have to call AT&amp;T. I then call AT&amp;T who redirected me back to Samsung, telling me that it is a fault with the maker of the phone and not with the service provider. I once again called Samsung who tried to solved the problem over the phone, but was unable to. Samsung then gave me a R.M.A # and told me to send the phone to them, which I did. I am still waiting to hear from them."	0
"I bought the samsung sch u640 with high expectations. And I wasn&apos;t let down. This is one rugged phone. I have dropped into water and it still keeps working. I have dropped it off the roof of my house {into the grass} and it keeps working. The battery life will last a full day of heavy use, but not much more. The push to talk is handy if you have a need for it, which I don&apos;t. But it if you want to activate it on Page Plus pre paid service you will get Verizon service for a fraction of the cost. It is a thick-bulky phone. Quite impressive phone for a flip phone.    UPDATE; SINCE WRITING THIS REVIEW I HAVE PURCHASED THE NEWER VERSION, SCH U660, CONVOY2. THIS PHONE IS ALMOST IDENTICAL TO THE U640, IT DOES HAVE A CAMERA FLASH THAT SERVES DOUBLE DUTY AS A FLASH LIGHT. THE BATTERY IS THE SAME. SAME COLOR AND BUTTONS ARE THE SAME."	1

"I bought this as a replacement for a damage phone, this item is not old and will not work with new sym cards. Seller told me to call my carrier, who told me puting as up todate sym card in this phone was like putting a Model-T engine into a new car. DO not purchase!"	0
I bought this as it was just like my old one.  However after paying 25.00 to have the address book transferred I find it just skipped a lot of them.  It worked pretty good at first.  Now it drops text messages and real slow when it is making a message and sometimes just puts the letter in 4-5 times and you have to clear.  Worse than mine was that I replaced. What is the worst is the dropped text messages that I don't get.  Between the phone and transferring I am now in it for $50.00 and will now have to buy a good phone. Very disappointed	0
"I bought this because it was fairly priced, and simple for my wife to use. I had a problem with the way the phone book entries went into the phone. So I called motorola and told them about the problem and gave them information on this phone that was supposed to be brand new, but it turned out the phone was out of warranty. I tried to contact the seller numerous times the same day, the next day, and the next day,and got no answer so it look like I&apos;m stuck with this phone."	0

"I bought this board; it arrived quickly (I'll give him that). When I started connecting it up to the phone, I noticed the WIFI antenna jack was missing from the board; I'm not going to accept a board that doesn't support WIFI, so I didn't even bother testing it further, there may have been other things wrong with it as well. I contacted him and explained, but he didn't want to deal with me. At first he didn't even understand what I said (or was playing dumb) and then he starts coming up with all kinds of excuses (some that don't even make sense), hoping that I would just go away. Getting him to take responsibility for the sale was like pulling teeth! I opened a case and he claimed that I tampered with the board and he refuses to take it back. Meanwhile, HIS OWN PICTURE IN THE AUCTION clearly shows that the jack is in fact missing!!!! Look for yourself; don't take my word for it. Ebay wound up ruling in my favor (Thank you Ebay!!).  I see someone else bought a logic board from this guy and left bad feedback, calling him a fraud. I didn't know what had transpired between him and his buyer because the space they give you to type is too small. Sometimes the buyer is the problem; perhaps they broke something and claimed it was broken to get another one free by taking advantage of the "	0

"I bought this cellphone from wikiwoo from Louisville,Ky. This seller left all their text messages, and their phone list in the phone sold and sent it to me. I tried to text one of the people in the phone who had ask wikiwoo about paying someones phone bill and I tried to text another person who wikiwoo had told about her birthday and I tried to text another where they were talking about a mall.I never got a text back from them and at that time I knew something was wrong.I email wikiwoo for the first time and did not get a reply.  I can not get my text messages to work.I can&apos;t send a text. I can not receive text. I have been to two Cricket stores to have the phone checked to see why I can&apos;t get my text messages or send text messages. Each time I was in the stores for more than 30 minutes. Each store was not able to fix the phone. I email wikiwoo and got no reply from them. The phone is still not fixed and I had to get another phone. I waste my money on this one and I will NEVER buy again from this seller. wikiwoo I wish I had not bought from you and I advise others to check the name of the seller and not buy from you. It may be funny to you reading this but you will loose more than what you took from me wikiwoo. I know you knew this phone wasn&apos;t working, I feel it in my heart and that is why I got the phone so quickly and the reason you did not remove the phone list or text messages. You knew that phone wasn&apos;t working correctly and I have not bought from ebay since I couldn&apos;t get the phone to work correcly.Why did I not contact ebay and let them no this issue was not resolved, and that I had contacted this seller and got no reply, well I took the loss and went to AMAZON.COM. I GOT A BOMB DEAL FROM WIKIWOO DON&apos;T BUY FROM THIS SELLER. WATCH FOR THE NAME. IN CASE THEY CHANGE THE NAME THE LOCATION IS LOUISVILLE,KY. REMEMBER WIKIWOO wikiwoo wikiwoo shame on you!

I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS SELLER TO ANYONE!!!!!!!!"	0
I bought this expecting it to be unlocked but it wasn't. They were great at contact me surprisingly.

"I bought this for my boyfriend after he broke his S7. He has had a different Blu phone in the past and he says this is set up the same as the past one. It has a longer than most battery (around 2 days with moderate use such as Pandora at work and a few texts). He has dropped it a few times and it has no screen cracks.

"I bought this for the worldphone capability. Ill be surprised if it actually works when i need it to overseas, since it barely works here. It constantly shuts off on its own about 5 times a day. Sometimes it makes calls, sometimes it just freezes up. The touchscreen is awful. Touch something and it picks something else. There is no slow scroll through apps.

It was sent quickly and arrived in perfect condition, just as one would hope for.  This is the second phone I have bought from this seller.  Both times were excellent experiences."	1
"I bought this HTC Touch a week ago, and was excited to test it out. To my disappointment, once I put my sim card in, it was unable to connect with my phone service due to poor reception. Also, found the touch screen very slow to respond, and the software slow to load when turned on. Not one I would recommend."	0

I bought this item back in October still have not received my item and have not heard anything back from the seller I would not buy this item ever again and I do not recommend anybody to buy anything from this seller I paid for the cell phone emailed complained wanted to find out where the tracking history was no response back this guy is a scam he probably is making Insurance off of everyone's money and it shouldn't be people out there like this I have to wait 3 months before I get my money returned to me from eBay because the seller won't even contact me back and be a man and give me my money back to me. I feel like he's just ripping me off and trying to make interest off my money	0
"i bought this item because i need it for my job, i like everything from it. i think this is a good cellphone for jobs like mine. i think this cellphone is good from falling from my pocket."	1
I bought this item because I wanted it for my grandson. The price was very good and I thought it would make a great gift. I liked the look of it and the fact it had the mobile TV on it. I dislike the fact that the tv was FLO tv and was discontinued but was not mentioned in the description. If I had to buy it again I wouldnt. I could only get 911 on it and it never functioned properly.	0

"I bought this mobile for my partner on ebay secondhand as she was looking for an easy to use but strong mobile.Although this mobile can be described as a little bit heavy,it is easy to use and can for some reason pick-up a signal where other mobiles have failed.The buttons are both easy to use,texting is easy and it has a great camera.On ebay they seem to hold on to there value secondhand rather well.It appears that people are always ready to purchase these mobile.That must be a sign of a good mobile.The battery life is good and new covers are readly available on ebay should you wish to make your mobile look New Again.A great mobile that will be as honest as the day is long."	1
I bought this new Motorola i776 boost mobile and was impress not only at the product itself but on the price that i bought the item. I didnt expect for me to find a product so cheap but thanks to this seller not only did it save me from my job but from buying it somewhere else where they would charge me more.	1
I bought this new phone. I didn&apos;t like anything about it. The phones features are not as great as others have told me. I thought it was hard to use.	0
I bought this one for myself to replace my iPhone 6 Plus.  This phone does everything you can think of and more!	1
I bought this Palm because I like the brand its so professional. The only thing I think may go wrong with this phone maybe the touch-screen as do most touch-screen phones. This phone is awesome and unlike iphone it doesn&apos;t seem like everyone has one because they are so complex.	1
"I bought this phone (E90-NOKIA). I have been using this phone before. Accidently I had lost my old phone before. Hence I was looking for a new one in UAE. But as I understood from the supplier here that this model has been discontinued, I checked ebay and found that they are selling.     I contacted the seller and got one. They shipped me all as mentioed in their advertisement. I am happy and I would like to give that seller a five star rating."	1
i bought this phone 2 years ago and let me tell you it was a mistake it is completely trash from the beginning i would have returned it if i didnt get locked out of my email and ebay account the day of purchase there is a big pink thick line started out thin it is now randomly popping up more and more lines the charger port is very loose and the phone is not unlocked  now here i go again having to pay 200 for a new phone	0
I bought this phone 4-5 weeks ago.. I am very satisfied with the quality of product. Very nice product in a give price.	1
I bought this phone a few weeks ago and found that the microphone did not work.  The speaker phone option did not work either.  The company Alltechwholesale sent me a pre-paid mailing lable and gave me a quick refund after they received the phone.	1
"I bought this phone a few weeks ago, I purposely didn't want to make a review until i had the phone for a while so i could make a honestly review. I must say i was super surprised to get such a AMAZING phone for an AMAZING deal. The phone was slightly used but you can hardly tell. The seller was super nice and also shipped it fast and free. Couldn't have asked for anything else. I most certainly will be buying for here AGAIN!  Thank you."	1
"I bought this phone about 3-4 months ago, and I love it. It fits almost anywhere, the screen is about 2inches{maybe 2 inches}, but very high in definition {color and contrast are awesome}, It allows music tones, and regular tones, you can download from the internet right off your phone and the games are awesome to. You can set multiple alarms. You have a digital camera {128x128}, {640x480} and you have zoom. But, only one thing...  about the zoom, the picture on the level to where you can zoom in or out isn&apos;t very clear, the only downfall of the phone.   You have mobile email, you have IM, you can set up right from your computer to go to your phone, One text message holds 1071 characters. I love how small it is, I hate bulky items. And you get one free face so you can change the color of the faceplate. AND DID I MENTION THIS IS A GOPHONE, pay as you go. So, no outstanding phone bills!!!! No going over the limit in minutes!!! AWESOME!!!! Look it up, I&apos;m sure I didnt mention all the features!!!!!"	1
I bought this phone about a month ago and the product was excellent.It was much better than the seller describer also came with a few extras that was awesome. It works great I am very pleased with the qaulity of the phone. It was priced just right also :)	1
"I bought this phone about three weeks ago and so far I love it. There are so many things like the screen, performance, battery life, and overall build quality that I feel a phone should be like. The one negative is around the GPS performance. I had this phone replaced under warranty and the GPS was better, but not perfect, but at least it works now.     This phone when compared to any other Android based phone, it right up there with the best. I would choose this phone definately over any of the phones that ATT offers right now."	1
"I bought this phone after having a Sanyo Incognito for 5 months, I thought this phone would be an upgrade, since the price is more. But I was wrong, this phone the internet is REALLY slow, you cannot play full movies or Youtube videos, you also cannot get any applications to download. And on the boost website there are no apps or games available for the RANT.  Overall the way it works it simple, the keyboard is to my liking, the keys are a little hard to push but you get used to it. The display quality could be better for the money, and the web browsing should deffinately be better. When you get a webpage to load on this you will almost have to have a magnifying glass to read them the text is so small.  Honestly if I knew this phone was this bad I would have kept my incognito and delt with its minor flaws."	0
"I bought this phone almost 1 month ago, but i did a big mistake, when the phone arrived i just check if been work turn the power on and checkout the shape, was ok and i left the feedback positive. So 1 week later when in try to connected to my co. (Nextel), they said the phone has report stole or lost, for somebody and this case can&apos;t be activate. I&apos;ve tried to contact the seller but no answer, not single explanation. I&apos;m really don&apos;t worry about $15.00, but respect."	0
I bought this phone and emailed and called several times no response from Seller.  This phone is crap it doesn&apos;t work right and not to mention its a RECALLED phone from att due to it catching on fire.  I will not buy from this company again and i hope no one else does either.  This could of been settled if they would of answered their phones or emails but no one would........	0
"I bought this phone and it barely worked. The phone stayed OFF more than it turned on. You can barely make any calls let alone receive them. I bought it for my daughter so she could communicate with me on her way to and from school. She ended up using someone else's phone to call me. It never stayed charged and when it did charge, it would cut off and not come back on for days.  I had the phone for about 3 weeks and in that time, the phone only ""worked"" about 4 days.  Save your money!!!!"	0
I bought this phone and it doesn&apos;t work!    I spent $180.00 !  Im Requesting a refund.  I&apos;m not sure what the problem is!  The phone will not charge or show any signs of coming on.  I tried a new charger and it still didn&apos;t work!	0
"I bought this phone and it will not update and will not stay on, device powers down and restarts continually."	0
"I bought this phone and less  then in a month it completely stopped working, won&apos;t even charge. I wrote to seller and she was very nice, replied that I send the phone back and she will refund me my money. I sent phone to her over a month ago and still haven&apos;t got anything from her. No responce, no refund :( And I know that she got the package, because I sent it with signature confirmation!!! So, I&apos;m very dissapointed in this seller&apos;s dishonesty! Was a complete waste of a $100 :("	0
"I bought this phone and spent 2+ days trying to get it to work with my carrier (cricket wireless) and talked to both the carrier and apple to fix the phone. I finally emailed the seller and asked what the original carrier was and their response was ""we can issue a full refund"". So I sent the phone back for the refund. There was something wrong with the internal/external antenna and it wouldn't connect to anything but wifi."	0
I bought this phone and waited for almost a week and the seller finally did not send anything and canceled the deal a bad seller	0
"I bought this phone as a back-up for my cell phone. I like the look of it, but it drops calls and the back panel can easily break. It is not bluetooth compatible, which is inconvenient while driving in states that do not allow you to talke on the phone while driving. I was dipleased with the purchase."	0
"I bought this phone as a Christmas present for my nephew and I'm glad I made such a wise choice. This phone is a decent size, it's easy on the eyes and handles very nice. The battery life exceeded my expectations and it has lightening speed. My only complaint which is more of a suggestion, is to buy a phone case, not only to protect the phone but it's a little ""slippy"" in the hand so a case helps with grip. Other than that small detail which is an easy fix, I highly recommend this phone. Its Great for beginners and professionals alike."	1
"I bought this phone as a gift for my little brother, and he loves it.....everyday it&apos;s something new about the phones music or the great sound it has.  the phone is very beautiful and compact. A great gift I would recommend for anyone or for yourself."	1
I bought this phone as a graduation present for my son. It works great. He really likes it!	1
"I bought this phone as a replacement for my main phone, so that we did not need to sign a contract with the phone company.  The first phone I received did not work at all, it would not power up. Contacted seller, and needed to send phone back then they would send out a replacement.  When I received the replacement, the battery would not hold a charge.  Contacted seller, they would send a battery replacement.  Received battery replacement, battery did not fit into the phone.  Contacted seller, they would send another battery.  They sent it, but I did not receive it.  So, they sent another. In the mean time, I ordered a battery from another company.  Received the BRAND NEW battery from the other company and then finally the USED battery from this seller!  The brand new battery is working great in my &quot;new to me&quot; phone.  Glad to be done with this ordeal.  After all is said and done, the second phone I received was in good shape and good working order.  Very disappointed that they would not send a NEW battery to go along with it.  Not sure how they expect people to be able to use the phones they sell, with discharged batteries."	0
"I bought this phone as a replacement for my son&apos;s Cingular cell phone.  I love this Phone because it was originally for AT&amp;T wireless (but has been unlocked)therefore the phone can be used for Cingular or T-Mobile but will not allow a conncetion to the internet, hence no downloading or net surfing. Its perfect for simply talking and text messaging.  Plus the small design easily fits in a pocket, and the slider feature is cool!"	1
"I bought this phone as a replacement to one i had gotten wet,wich was the blackberry 8830 that i love but wanted a camera.Just wish this phone had more internal memory because the pictures use so much at least until i had time to get memory card."	1
"I bought this phone as a temporary replacement for my smart phone.  The only thing I disliked about this phone was how tiny it was.  The ringer was loud like I wanted, the keyboard was stiff but usable (brand new so understandable)The default themes were sorta lame but I was able to live through it."	1
"I bought this phone as an upgrade, this is an awesome phone. I really like it. Its user friendly and access all apps. It has great clarity and fast when surfing the web. I like the qwerty keyboard but the quality of the keys could have been better kinda cheaply made. Other than that its a good phone for someone thats upgrading for the first time to an android phone."	1
"I bought this phone b/c I saw it in the store and I thought it looked like it would be a nice phone.  I wasn&apos;t really in need of a new phone, but every now and then I get the urge to buy new ones.  When I received the phone, I didn&apos;t like it nearly as much as I thought I would.  Since the display phones in stores are all &quot;fake,&quot; I couldn&apos;t test any of the features before I bought it.  This particular phone seemed very primitive in this technological era.  The features weren&apos;t that great, and the camera wasn&apos;t a very good quality.  After about 15 minutes of playing w/ it, I knew this phone was not one I wanted to keep, so I sold it on eBay and hopefully this phone satisfies them!"	0
I bought this phone because I dropped my IPhone 5s in the pool. It does everything my 5s did except the battery does not last as long. I have ordered a waterproof case for it since I am around the pool a lot. The phone works flawlessly and arrived very quickly. I would buy again.	1
"I bought this phone because I had good experience with Nokia in the past. I like the Flip Phone because the keyboard is protected in your pocket. It is slim and has a protective sheath which can be replaced. A couple of extras I liked are, missed calls show the time of call when you open the phone. It&apos;s better than having to go through the menu. The ringer has a new tone that sounds like the old style telephone. Its alerts you as e-mails come in. It is user friendly."	1
"I bought this phone because I had lost my old cell phone, and in lieu of extending my current contract or purchasing one in stores for more than $100, I decided to find a better deal on eBay.  As far as that goes, it was a great buy.  The phone itself leaves much to be desired. I have had several phones in my life, and never has one been so difficult to use. The phone takes a long-winded route to do anything at all. I&apos;ve accidentally deleted several numbers because of the strange setup for the speed dial. It&apos;s hard to call people; the address book in poorly constructed. There&apos;s a delay when doing anything at all. When you have a missed call- or even if you&apos;re just trying to check your recent calls- you can&apos;t find out what time someone called you. It has a different setup from anything I&apos;ve ever used, and simply doesn&apos;t make sense in many ways.   I know that I will get used to this phone, but I would not recommend it to anyone- unless you enjoy hating your phone, being confused, and using more profanity than usual!"	0
"I bought this phone because I have had unlocked Samsung phones before and have worked very well. In this case, the phone did not work most of the time it was on. The phone was advertised as new; but it was not new. It was returned several times to the vendor because it did not work very well. On a scale of 1 to 10 (compared to my other phones), I would give it a 2.    Sparkyfly59"	0
"i bought this phone because i liked all the specs on the phone and the apps its an awsome phone the internet,maps,latitude,navigation"	1
"I bought this phone because I needed a phone fast, because mine had broken. It was a little on the expensive side, but I thought maybe that would be better, and the product would have a better quality. This is the WORST phone I have EVER OWNED, it drops calls constantly, and when the call does go through, the person on the other end can not understand you. I would not recommend this phone to anyone EVER."	0
"I bought this phone because i really like the shape and size of it and also it works really good and takes good pictures, thanks alot for the phone."	1
I BOUGHT THIS PHONE BECAUSE I WANTED A TOUCH SCREEN PHONE AND I ALSO WANTED TO BE ABLE TO RUN MY EBAY BUSINESS WHEN I WAS AWAY FROM HOME ... THIS PHONE IS AMAZING AND SO WORTH THE MONEY SPENT I WOULD BUY AGAIN AND I WOULD TELL OTHERS TO BUY.	1
"I bought this phone because I wanted to have a PDA available all the time and this is better than carrying two devices. I have found the the phone and PDA both work great. The PDA used Windows Mobile as a base OS and my previous knowledge of the Windows OS made the transition to the mobile system a breeze. My only dissatisfaction is not with the phone but with the phone company. I had hopes of just using the PDA portion of the phone with purchasing the data package from the phone company. I had and have no desire to text, serf the web or any of the other junk one does on the web. But no, the phone company sent me an email saying they were adding another $25.00 to my account for using the smartphone. Now, I only use the phone without the phone company&apos;s Sim card. Enough about that. Lastly, the phone is great, easy to use the slide keyboard is easy to access and the phone size fits my hand easily. I recommend the seller of the phone for his great service and the phone for the reasons I have explained above."	1
"i bought this phone because i&apos;ve had one like it before. after about a 1/2 hour on the line with my service provider trying to activate this phone, we discover that the battery is defective. i returned the phone and got a quick response &amp; refund from the seller."	0
"I bought this phone because it has a keyboard but boy I was wrong this phone is garbage nothing works on it, dont buy this phone or you will waste your money."	0
"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE BECAUSE IT HAS SERVICE ALMOST ANY WHERE YOU GO AND ALSO TAKES A MEMORY CARD! THIS PHONE IS GREAT FOR TEXTING,CAMERA,VIDEO,AND ALL! EVERYONE SHOULD OWN A PHONE LIKE THIS! YOU WILL LOVE IT"	1
I bought this phone because it said it was an unlocked phone. When it came today an I tried to use it is not a unlocked phone. I can not use my phone carrier with this phone because under item description it says that it is an unlocked network. Clearly someone got it wrong. Not happy I have to send back the phone for a refund.	0
"I bought this phone because it was advertised as unlocked because I only have the intention of using it overseas and it's not even unlocked, despite the fact that it's scratched all along the back (that I expected) but also scratched on the camera. It has glitches when I click on certain things and seems like it's going to be a hassle to use once I pay (again) to have it actually unlocked. Not a trustworthy vender. Look elsewhere for merchandise."	0
I bought this phone because it was the only flip phone approved by assurance wireless. The reception is pitiful and the battery goes dead very fast due to the phone searching for service all the time. The volume is very low and speaker is poor. Can barely hear it even on speaker phone. I didn&apos;t expect much for $20.00 and that is what I got. I would not recommend this phone for anyone.	0
"I bought this phone because my girlfriend broke her phone but was not eligible for a discount on a new one.  Unfortunately, this phone was stolen and cannot be activated.  the seller assumes no responsiobility for this, and i am still waiting on the paypal investigation surrounding this incident.  it is a shame that people like this give ebay and paypal such a bad rep."	0
I bought this phone because my Motorola Razr VM9 phone is going on 12 years. I wanted to get another before mine died!  This phone I purchased is NOT an original Motorola Razr VM9.  This one was a lot thicker and it is more difficult to remove the battery.	0
"I bought this phone because my other phone broke and I needed a new phone quick.  I also liked the keyboard feature of this phone because the majority of what I do is texting.  The keyboard feature is the best feature of this phone.  The rest of the phone is worthless.  After ever text and every time you make a change in the menu and annoying &quot;ding dong&quot; tone is made and there is no way to turn this off unless the phone is on vibrate or silent.  How would I hear new calls coming in if it is on vibrate  or silent?  Also, you can only save 3 downloaded ringtones to this phone and in order to set up ringer ids you have to set up user groups.  That would be fine, except I hve more than 3 people I like to identify with their own rings, AND the only things identified are the incoming calls, NOT texts by those people.  3rdly, the menu is no user friendly.  When you miss a call or a text comes in... you have to get it immediately otherwise you have to enter the menu to receive it.  It doesn&apos;t just pop up with a note that you missed a call... or that you have a  message and one button and you are reading it.... noooooo.... Also the fact that you have to lock the keypad so that you aren&apos;t dialing and hitting buttons while it is in your pocket or purse... that also hinders the quick answering and returning of messages/texts....   Once again... the keyboard feature is nice... i suppose the camera is nice .. but i don&apos;t use it... but the rest of the phone is ridiculously annoying...."	0
"i bought this phone because of it&apos;s sound quality and it&apos;s easy useage.infact this phone acts as best value for your money.long lasting battery,as compare to other phones it&apos;s the best so far among the phones i have ever use.the only thing i dislike about this phone is that the key pads are too small."	1
"I bought this phone because of its simplistic design an easy UI. I love the solid one-piece hardware with its clear black display shows great in the sun,and the slick Windows Phone OS. I don&apos;t care for the overall thickness and length. I prefer a screen that takes up the entire face of the device and this phone has a lot of wasted space on the top and bottom.  This phone can only be compared to other Windows Phones and in this instance it comes in as number 1 followed by the Titan II."	1
I bought this phone because the listing said it would work on at&t network but whenever I got it the phone doesnt make or receives calls the seller wont answer messages very disappointed 	0
I bought this phone becouse at&amp;t would&apos;nt repair my phone due to not reporting   to the insurance company within 60 days. I was&apos;nt told i needed to report it  in a set time and got busy doing other things. So far this one has done everything that i need it to and takes great pictures. So if you pay your insurance to at&amp;t for two years make sure you turn in a claim within the 60 days.	1
I bought this phone being very excited... Once i receive the phone i put service on it to find out there is no signal on the phone... Thought about resaling the phone on E-Bay... Then really thinking about it .... I was worried the phone annteena was missed up... So i contacted the saller... He agreeded that he would take the phone back.... And refund all my money... So i run to the post office and mail it... 300.00 dollars ins and off to sleepy hollow... It takes him 2 weeks to go pick it up... I haVE A COPY FROM THE POST OFFICE WITH HIS SIGNATUE AND hIS ADDRESS ON BEEKMAN AVE... SAYING HE GOT THE PACKAGE... not only that but also talked to him on the phone and he said he recieved it and needed to resale it before i could get my money back... What a dissapointment... I waited and then talked to ebay protection.... tarted a case... Thank god for them... Now iam just waiting for a full refund... should know something soon... Iam sure ill get my money soon... so if you buy something.... MAKE SURE YOU GET EBAY BUYER PROTECTION... So if your seller aint so good to you... Good luck... Wish this phone had signal i would have loved it... and plan on shopping more with ebay...	0
I bought this phone by mistake I returned the phone to the seller but they didn't gave me my refund back  	0
"I bought this phone entirely to try out the firefox os. One of my hobbies is to play around with the different operating systems I have an interest in, even if they are now defunct. This phone is listed as new but is instead rooted and has cyanogenmod installed as the os, which is also a no longer supported os, not the firefox os that I bought the phone for. Despite it obviously not being new the phone itself does look very nice and all the buttons work so there's that I guess. Just don't buy this if you are hoping for a firefox phone or even for a supported os."	0
I bought this phone for a family member that leads a very active lifestyle. This is a very durable solid feeling phone. It is very simple to use and was quite a bargain!	1
"I bought this phone for my  son when we switched to T Mobile. It was a great price and it arrived in pristine condition from the seller, just as described. Beautiful phone and is steps above the 4s."	1

"I bought this phone for my autistic son bc he wanted a phone. When I got this phone it was locked to the emergency call screen only. I called the company and they said they would replace it, but they never did."	0
I bought this phone for my boyfriend on Christmas. He loves this phone! He has nothing but good things about it. Hasn&apos;t had any problems with it what so ever since he got it a month ago. The phone works great and would definitely buy another phone for any other family member!	1
"I bought this phone for my dad as a replacement for the phone he lost. It works great for basic phone capabilities. He is not a very technical guy so we don&apos;t use any of the extra features. I have several unlocked phones at home, but this one gets the best reception out of all of them. It&apos;s small and lightweight. We are very happy with this phone."	1
"I bought this phone for my daughter and she loves it.  It&apos;s pretty straight forward to use, but still has all the functions she needs.  The only surprise was that you have to purchase a data plan with these phones.  I wasn&apos;t aware of this and thought she would just be able to use it for texting, calling, music etc.  AT&amp;T sent her a text letting her know they had added a $25 per month data charge automatically.  I had to call AT&amp;T and after talking to them I was told there was no way around the data plan so I reduced it to the $15 a month plan.  Other than that, the phone is great."	1
"I bought this phone for my daughter who has a history of accidently breaking flip phones. I immediately likely this phone becauuse it is miniature and durable. She is able to slide it in a side pocket or in  her purse. The talk time for the battery usage is also great. The reception is also very clear. My only concern is that I have had a hard time trying to find a clip for this phone. But overall, I would definitely recommend this inexpensivive phone for anyone who has to continously replace their cell phone because of damage."	1
I bought this phone for my daughter who loves photography. She is in Heaven. My other daughter is jealous! Perfect phone for her needs.	1
I bought this phone for my elderly father because he just does not know how to use a cell phone this thing has to meany lights it burns up its charge in two days i need a phone not a light show..............	0
I bought this phone for my father. He's not so high tech. But this phone really done it. It is brand new with out packaging box but whatever. The box was getting thrown away anyways. Nothing I can say but the phone works great and performs as it should.	1
i bought this phone for my fiance because he loves the way it looks and how compact it is and although the price was good he used the phone for about two months and it stopped working. The main thing i would advise is to get insurance on this phone because sprint can not fix things like reception or the buttons being dirty.	1
"I bought this phone for my friend. It was near mint condition, as described. She has been using it for several days now and it is working flawlessly. Nice Seller! "	1
I bought this phone for my grandson and he is the one who picked it out.  He is very very happy and pleased with the purchase we made.  He chose this phone because it is a smart phone with touch screen.  It has all the cool features that he wanted in a phone.  He is 17.  Therefore I am very pleased with the product because he is happy with it.	1
I bought this phone for my handicap son to use because its a rugged phone and it said provider was Verizon. When I got the phone it did not have a SIM card and called Verizon to get one. I got the SIM card from Verizon and took it to Verizon to get activated. After over an hour I was informed thAt Verizon could not activate the phone because they no longer supported this phone. I have sent a message to Seller to get a refund  because I will have to buy another phone so waiting on reply from Seller. 	0
I bought this phone for my Husband he own a Mechanic Shop this phone is the only cell phone that has stood up alot of oil gets on it he is still using the previous phone he said when the other phone die then he'll switch to the new one. If you work with your hands and they're wet oily whatever this is the phone for you.	1
I bought this phone for my husband to replace his Lg shine.  He absolutely loves the phone.  The only thing is he can not have his favorite ringtone because it does not support the size.  Other than that it is a great phone.  It gets great service pretty much everywhere.	1
"I bought this phone for my husband, who works outdoors and needed a &quot;tough&quot; phone.  He was so excited, that is until it arrived.  The flashlight feature did not work, and the back panel was extremely difficult to remove for battery placement.  There were no English instructions included with this phone. We took it to the local cell phone shop to have it programed with my husband&apos;s existing phone number, only to find out, that even though it is &quot;unlocked&quot;, it only works with certain carrier&apos;s, and requires a sim card......we basically wasted $100 on this phone...as we now have to buy another phone that will work!"	0
"I bought this phone for my mom. To replace the T-Mobile version of this phone. I thought when I ordered this phone that it was a T-Mobile version as described. It was not. The software is not the same. The phone turns off on its own and won't turn back on when I hit the power key. I have to take out the battery, reinsert it then hit the on key for it to work again. I have to go through this process daily. The phone calls are not clearly heared. To top it off the calls drop too. I bought this phone from USA stock, it was shipped from New York. When I contacted the vendor for a refund I was directed to China. The reply was that they'll get back to me because it was holiday season. I have to wait approximately 2 weeks for a reply. This is frustrating. They were quick to take my money but when I want to return the defected item it will take me over 2 weeks. I don't think it's fair for me to deal with the vendor in China when I could deal with the vendor that sent it from New York. I will not order items from foreign vendors anymore. "	0
I bought this phone for my nephew due to him damaging a iPhone 3G 8GB.  He seems to really like it and it more durable than the iPhone especially since my nephew is on 13 years old.  I will be purchasing another one for my other nephew since he did the same thing with his iPhone 3G 8GB.  It is a great phone I remove the SIM card from the iPhone and insert into this phone and it was up and running.	1
I bought this phone for my sister but the phone never worked. I contacted the seller but he never responded. I opened a case with eBay and the seller immediately started responding. He promised me to send me a replacement cell phone provided I close the case. I did close the case but the seller never kept his promise. He never sent me anything and had not replied to a single mail of mine ever since.   Overall I had a very poor experience. Please avoid buying anything from this seller.	0
I bought this phone for my son and I have been extremely disappointed with it.  I went against the reviews that I had read and cave in since this is the phone my son really wanted.  It is almost impossible to have a conversation as it consistently drops calls.  I definitely would recommend to STAY AWAY form this phone	0
"I bought this phone for my son, who drowned his previous one. He is thrilled with it. The price was good also."	1
I bought this phone for my son. It was locked and Sprint couldn&apos;t activate it. I called and they sent a second one. It didn&apos;t work either. They did give a refund. Sprint told my son it was 7 years old and worth about $5.	0
i bought this phone for my sons b-day it is a beautiful phone but verizon wouldnt activate it cause i am on a pay as u go plan and only ceratin phone will work with that. but just cellular was very helpful trying there best to get me hooked up and after we figured out that this phone would not work just cellular gave me a full refund with no problems i would buy from them again anytime	1
"I bought this phone for my wife as a christ mas present because she already have one, she wanted it just in case the other one gets damaged she will have that one for spare. it is a good phone and has alot  of detail in the phone. the other phones shes had are not like this one if i have to buy anothe one I&apos;ll buy it."	1
"I bought this phone for my wife for Christmas. The features I was looking for were looks, ease of understanding and use and lighted numbers and letters for night use.    This product has it all, a good choice fur sure."	1
"I bought this phone for my wife who prefers a keyboard rather than a touch screen smart phone.  The phone functions perfectly and is a great product. Actually, this is our second one because the camera lens on her original Stratosphere became very scratched, which was our fault.  Bottom line, we had the opportunity to switch to another phone but elected to stay with the quality which she had come to enjoy.  Cannot say enough good things about the Samsung phones and certainly the Galaxy Stratosphere.  We are just very glad to find a new one on ebay to purchase as a replacement.  Highly recommend this product for those who want the option of a keyboard or touch screen smart phone.  You will not be disappointed!"	1
"I bought this phone for my wife, she loves the slide open keyboard and ease of operation. The quality of the pictures is a plus."	1
"I bought this phone for my younger sister. I got it used because a 14 yr old doesn&apos;t really need something expensive anyhow. It&apos;s got a qwerty keyboard that fit well for texting, the phone feels durable, fits good in my hand, and was simple to use. It had a great signal in my home too, which is rare. I only get 2 or 3 bars at the most on my LG Xenon, but had 4 and 5 on this phone when I tested it. It has a micro sd card slot so you can expand the memory if you need more. I am considering getting one of these for myself as a back up phone. It&apos;s great, I think my sister will love it!"	1
"I bought this phone for one of my granddaughters. She adores the phone , she tells me it is just the right size for her. She has not had any problems.    I would have no qualms on buying another one if one of my other grandaughters wanted one."	1
I bought this phone for the important features described and I like this design and easy to use. When I started to using is easy to use and compare to other brands this is convenient to use.	1
"I bought this phone for the QWERTY keyboard, but LOVE it now. It is very easy to use, has several options thst I use regularly.      The ONLY thing I would change about the phone is that it has only 1 alarm setting and my Samsung Propel had 5."	1
"I bought this phone for two reasons, dual sim and runs windows mobile.  It will do both, however, the phone has a problem with restarting. Seemingly randomly it will shut itself down, you get a message that states &quot;Network or system error, reccomend shutdown&quot; then it will shut itself down. It doesnt matter what you are doing, I&apos;ve had it shutdown during a call so many times, I consider the phone useless now. I&apos;ve done some research on teh web and have found this is a common problem. Also, the phone is 2 months old, I take it out of the charger at 6 am, use it sparingly, since it keeps shutting itself off, and the battery is DEAD by 5 pm.  I dont even get 12 hours out of it. I suggest if you are looking for a phone, WAIT, someday they may fix these problems, in wich case it will be an awesome phone, but right now ACER doesnt seem interested in fixing it. I tried going through their website to get support, but I couldnt get any decent support their either. The vendor I got it from claims there is a firmware fix comeing, but I cant get a date out of him. So simply put, this could be an awesome phone with lots of abilities, if you could keep it turned on and the battery charged."	0
"I bought this phone from a seller that was selling stolen phones, now i can&apos;t activate the phone and it was my son&apos;s christmas gift,, watch who u buy from on here your safer buying a phone from the store!"	0
I bought this phone here i need to contract the seller i was taking pictures in the pool the phone got wet inside and is no longer working. This was the main purpose of buying this phone because I was told it is water resistant  	0
"I bought this phone in April 2017. When it arrived the battery would not charge. I contacted the seller and he sent me a return shipping envelope and said he would send another phone. Well 2 months later, no phone, so I contacted him again and he said he would issue a refund. OK THIS IS JULY 19TH, 2017----NOTHING. I HAVE SENT MANY EMAILS AND THE RESPONSE I GOT WAS THAT THEY WERE BUSY AND TO BE PATIENT. 3 MONTHS LATER BE PATIENT????????? IT'S NOT ABOUT THE MONEY , IT'S ABOUT CUSTOMER SERVICE, WHICH THEY HAVE NONE. ANNNNNND THEY STILL HAVE MY MONEY !!!!!"	0
"I bought this phone in June 2017, it was defective, the touch screen didn't work properly. I requested return the item but the seller refused. Then I opened the claim through the Paypal, and after that seller had to accept the return. I sent the phone with tracking number but because of the seller didnt confirm the phone arrived, I couldnt get my refund yet! The communication with seller is ZERO. they just dont care about customers! Do NOT RECOMMEND TO BUY FROM THIS CUSTOMER. "	0
"I bought this phone just for an inbetween my Nokia E71 and an Android. I had no reception in parts of San Francisco, Oakland, and anywhere else we decided to take mini vacations. At my home it will not work unless I go outside and hold it in the air to find at least one bar!! AT&amp;T is the worst cell service I have ever had!!!! Straight talk works great with Verizon!!! Great customer service"	0
"I bought this phone mainly because I didn&apos;t want to pay the big price for the iphone,I didn&apos;t really expect much but it wasn&apos;t what I expected.Before anyone buys this phone a couple of things to keep in mind first of all though 3g is in the name you do not get 3g coverage.Second this phone does not seperate music by albums or artists music is just lumped together,though you can kind of organize it you still have to scroll through all songs to get to what you want.Third,you cannot play youtube videos directly from youtube.You have to download videos and change the file type on your computer then load it on phone.Fourth and last the batteries that come with this phone stinks they don&apos;t even last 8 hours if you make calls or text.I wouldn&apos;t tell people not to buy it but just give careful consideration first."	0
"I bought this phone new when it came out years ago. For me it is the perfect phone. I learned it so that I can operate it to make phone calls on the go with one hand. So when TMobile stopped offering it as a replacement, I found this one on the EBay. And now I know if I need to replace it again I know where to find another one. And I definately will get another one."	1
"I bought this phone on 4/24 and was not satisfied with the product. Returned the product on 4/30.  Sent 3 seperate e-mails to request for a refund.  Got a response on the 3rd e-mail, for which seller promised to refund my money since they had received the phone already.  Have sent 2 e-mails since then, and STILL NO REFUND!  I would highly recommend finding an alternative seller that has business integrity.  There are too many honest sellers out there with superior product and options!"	0
"I bought this phone on price, smaller size and on other peoples ratings of the cell phone.    My old phone had speed dial.  I havn&apos;t found that yet in this new phone.  Overall I like it.    Thanks"	1
"I bought this phone refurbished because on mine (the exact model) the sound was messing up when you played songs.  Anyway, everything was great except the refurbished one would go haywire when trying to text.  It would &quot;hang up&quot; then start typing on it&apos;s own so you would have to turn it off and back on to stop the madness.  Overall, I love this type of phone, just be careful of refurbished ones :-/"	1
"I bought this phone skeptical, part of me thought an iPhone for 70$ was way too good to be true and my instinct was right. First of all I paid for the product on 2/25/11 and did not receive it till late march. Then it wasn&apos;t even in like a package, it was the iPhone box wrapped in bubble wrap. My main complaint though is the seller uses an iPhone in his description, ships it in an iPhone box, the phone itself has the apple and iPhone logos on it. But when you turn it on the screen is more pixlelated than a 2001 nokia cell phone. You could find a nicer and cheaper phone in your local cell phone store. I would not recommend this product to any other users, on the fact it took a month to recieve it, and the quality of the phone is bad, you&apos;d be better off with a phone from best buy or radio shack."	0
"I bought this phone so I could take pictures of items I want to list on E-Bay, my adult children have this and their photos are better than the camera that I was using, It is very easy to send the photos to my email. I like almost  every thing about this phone, The talk minutes, text minutes and data are all separate so if you run out of minutes for on it does not mean you are totally out of minutes. The one thing I don&apos;t like is your available minutes are not displayed you have to go to the browser and look it up, not a huge problem though just not used to it. This is the best pre paid cell phone I have ever had. I love it."	1
"I bought this phone thinking I was about to have a very nice phone until my FedEx tracking said it was delivered but to find nothing, no knock at the door or anything. Called eBay and opened a dispute for then to tell me later in the day that tracking says it was delivered so guess you don't get your money back!!! So now I have to spend $250 more dollars just to get a phone for my carrier!!! EBay has terrible customer service skills and I WILL NOT be doing business with them anymore!!! I do not recommend anyone to do business with this company or eBay!!!"	0
"I bought this phone three months ago, from Verizon, because I was awed by its looks. But looks are deceiving....I had it for a week, then then screen quit working completely. I received another one. It worked perfectly until now. If i  do not take 5 seconds to close the phone it cuts itself off. It also cuts itself off if i drop it onto a table 2 inches above it. I hate this phone and i think no one should ever get this phone because its a waste of time and money! I highly recommend that yo9u should not get this phone! NEVER EVER EVER EVER!"	0
"i bought this phone to down grade my plan but it did not work as expected, maybe with other carriers but not mine."	0
"I bought this phone to get back to using an android phone.  Boy was THAT a mistake.  I should have realized when it took over two and a half hours (and 6 reps at Sprint) to get the stupid thing connected to the network.    Every day that&apos;s passed the phone has gotten worse and worse.  It is currently 4:19pm.  I hit the power button on my phone at 3:57pm and it&apos;s still at the splash screen trying to turn on.  It&apos;s been running slower and slower and slower, and now it seems it won&apos;t turn on.  I&apos;ve been trying for about two and a half hours now to get this stupid POS to turn on.    While I appreciate Samsung trying to make an affordable android phone, I sure wish they&apos;d cut a few less corners while doing so.    If you&apos;re thinking of buying this phone .. DO NOT DO IT!!!! Go to sprints website, look at the reviews, I am NOT the only one with problems."	0
I bought this phone to have a nice flip phone to use.  Perfect match......I hope to keep it for years!	1
I bought this phone to replace a blue one of the same model that got dropped in water.  My daughter really loved the phone and it was cheaper for me to buy one on ebay than to get a replacement through the insurance. This a great phone for texting and does quite a bit on the internet too.  She likes it much better than the rant that she used to have.	1
"I bought this phone to replace a phone that was stolen.  I am very happy with my purchase.  This Blackberry is better that the other one.  The screen is easier to read and the icons are clearer.  I also like that you can set the phone up for WiFi is you want to use your own internet connection on your phone.  I would recommend this phone to anyone who doesn&apos;t want a monthly bill commitment, but a great phone."	1
"i bought this phone to replace mine that broke it is a very good phone love it ,it did take a little while getting here after all it did come from china"	1
"I bought this phone to replace my current Nokia 6500 slide.  Unfortunately, the new phone does not work.  The battery is fully charged and it won&apos;t turn on. The front sliding piece is on crooked. It did not come in a Nokia box, but in a ML Royal S3588 box, so I am not even sure if it is new as advertised.  Also, no software was included.  I know how to work this kind of phone because I love the one I already have.  I am very disappointed and won&apos;t buy from this seller again."	0
"I bought this phone to replace my original droid turbo that was not working right .I did not have this phone a week and the screen is already broke!!!!! This phone is supposed to have gorilla glass like my previous phone,but I believe that the screen was replaced in it with a cheaper glass just for resale.if I had known this I would have not bought it.yerrible product ,I should have been notified before purchase about this screen.thumbs down from me will never purchase again from this seller,i advise not to purchase from this seller"	0
"I bought this phone to upgrade my old one and when it arrived, I was ecstatic! It had a clean look, no scratches and it was just a great looking phone. I quickly charged it and let it sit, but when I came back hours after, it was only charged to 23%. Its a bit odd but I understand that sometimes it take a while. I turned it on to read about ways to help charging and after 3 minutes of use, it shut off. I was surprised so I attempted to turn it back on and them it was at 0%. I left it on the charger overnight and wanted to wait for the morning before I messed with it again. In the morning it was at 92% and I was pretty relieved. I turned it on & it immediately shut down dropped the battery level to 33%. I downloaded an app called battery doctor to evaluate the battery itself and it said it was in good shape. I have used that app on previous phones and its pretty accurate. I really enjoyed the look of the phone, but after paying over $200 dollars for a phone, I would hope it would go at least a full day. Unfortunately, as much as I enjoy the look of the phone, I have to return it and look elsewhere for business."	0
"I bought this phone to use with my Mavic drone. Its just the ticket with a brilliant, sharp display. Even out doors where it is to be used."	1
"I bought this phone under the assumption that the phone was deactivated to where I can get the phone activated under my number and come to find out that the phone was still activated and wasn&apos;t able to get the phone under my contract. I was in a house fire a few weeks ago and my phone was part of my buisness, I am a truck driver and I am on the road constantly and when my old phone burned up in the fire I tried saving money by buying a phone on ebay and now I am screwed because not only and I out of money I am out of a phone also."	0

"I bought this product after having dropped my phone in water. What I like about this product is the full key board, the slim physique of the phone, as well as the white and green color palette. what I would change about the phone are the ringtone choices, something catchy but not annoying. I would buy thing product again though."	1
I bought this product as a gift for my family and ever since I gave it to my family they have loved it. No complains! It took a while to adjust and to learn how to use it but they loved it.   I liked the fact that it was delivered timely and well packaged.	1
"I bought this product as a replacement. it&apos;s light, has nice features, and its a good value. It&apos;s a great phone for not-a-smart-phone and the mobile web isn&apos;t too bad either."	1
I bought this product because I like the brand Samsung and I liked the style of the phone but when I received the phone I could not use it. The phone was locked and I was never able to get it unlocked it gets poor reception. I have never been able to use this phone.	0
"I bought this product because I needed a new reliable key board android.  I like this phone because it was exactly what I was looking for.  But what I had about the phone is that it constantly freezes up. Also, that battery life if horriable. I  charge it for 4 hours to use it only for 30 min overall time."	0
"I bought this product because I wanted something inexpensive but will also work well with just chatting. I had this for about a month and had to replace the batteries TWICE. I did like the ease of use for this phone, but was disappointed because I couldn&apos;t charge my phone. I would recommend getting something else. Although the price was right, the saying is true; you get what you pay for. I went and bought another phone (not online) for a higher price, different model, but it&apos;s working properly."	0
"I bought this product because it had all the features for which I was looking in a smart phone; a large 4.5 screen, wifi, access to the internet, easy to use and access to the App Store.  The seller was beyond helpful and cooperative.  There are newer phones with larger screens, but the Infuse is big enough and with 4G capability, really fast."	1
"I bought this product because it was an upgrade from my blackberry...supposedly. what a piece of junk! it&apos;s constantly launching apps that suck up battery. I had to download an app to kill these others. Battery lasts almost a day if you don&apos;t use it too much. Unit deleted all the pictures off my SD card that I&apos;ve had for years. It placed a call while sitting on the seat next to me. It froze up during an incoming call. Needless to say, I returned it."	0
I bought this product because of good features &amp; easy to use comparing other brands. Battery life also good and reasonable price for middle income people. I would say this is excellent phone to use in all purposes.	1
i bought this product becuase i needed a new phone i had a alaxy s3 and this new galaxy note 3 is soo much better! great phone i love the new 5 inch screen size!	1
I bought this product for my fiance.  She loves it It&apos;s thin light reliable.  She loves how it handles text messages over Bluetooth and the camera is great!	1
I bought this product for my uncle. He&apos;s not updated with the touch phones and I thought this phone is perfect for him    :)	1
"I bought this product for use with Straight Talk, all I needed was a sim card that you can get at Walmart for AT&amp;T or T-Mobile and the service has been stellar and only 45$ a month. Can&apos;t beat it! The phone works well with multitasking and the battery life is great for a smart phone. It is also not as large as the Note phones, so easily fits in most pockets."	1
I bought this product knowing that it was used but didn&apos;t expect it to be unusable. The speaker isn&apos;t working and if I by mistake press speaker then I have no idea that the person is waiting on the line for me but I cant hear anything. secondly the ringer doesn&apos;t work so if I want to see if someone called I gotta check my missed calls. was very unimpressed and would be very careful next time I buy this item.	0
I bought this product last month and I found that I made a terrible dicision. The phone does&apos;t work. It is a bad phone. It&apos;s usually malfunction. Sometimes I want to throw it away. I always have a question in my mine. Is the seller robber?	0
"I bought this product to replace my current Nokia 6126 (which I bought new 3 years ago from Cingular with my call package).  I really like this model over any others I have checked into.  I like it&apos;s simplicity and ease of use.  It&apos;s body style is not too bulky or too thin...fits well in hand and pocket.      Really appreciate the sizable keys...really great for a senior like me.  I don&apos;t do the text thing, but know others who do and love the key&apos;s usability. The two sizable screens and sizable print is easy on the eyes.      Nokia 6126&apos;s durablility is great!  My original phone served me well for three years under fairly heavy use.  Because this model does so well, I purchased another to replace it.  IMO, it is a fairly tough cell phone and puts up with modest/heavy use.      The internal antenna is quite strong compared to most and I get great reception anywhere I go.  Sound is quite clear.  Speaker phone is of good quality as well.  The camera is a bonus and works great for my simple needs.      Nokia 6126 is a perfect cell phone for people like myself who want a basic cell phone with basic calling features.  I plan to keep using this style of Nokia as long as I can.  IMO...it&apos;s the best basic cell phone Nokia ever made...sure hope they keep making it.  Nothing compares to it for a simple, durable phone."	1
I bought this product with intentions of using it before I die. Still no product in the mail 22 days after purchasing it.	0
I bought this Rugby III to replace my Rugby II for the larger camera chip size. It takes nice pics. I like the Rugby for ruggedness and size. FIts perfect in my jeans coin pocket. 	1
"I bought this Samsung Galaxy S6 - NEW IN BOX, used for just 5 months, and suddenly, it died!    Dead as a doornail. Will not turn on, light up, ring, or any other function. Doesn't this have a 6 month/1 year warranty from someone.  Was this a phone returned to the company with defects?  - NOT a GOOD BUY ! ! "	0
"I bought this second hand from an eBay seller and learned the hard way that 9/10 cosmetically doesn't mean the phone works internally.  I spent 2 hours trying to activate this on my own, and then 3 hours at a Sprint repair shop trying a factory reset.  They had a 2 hr call with their tech support and told me the phone's mother board was defective.  I returned to the seller for a prompt refund."	0
I bought this smartphone because it had consistantly good reviews on Youtube and because I was able to purchase a lightly used one on ebay for $100. I haven&apos;t used it hard...just texting and a few phone calls but it has performed well and the battery life is outstanding.	1
"I bought this smartphone due to the low price, and quickly realized that was a mistake. The Huawei has a terrible running system and freezes up bad. I had to reboot the phone often even a few times a day. I would not recommend this phone. Huawei needs to recall these phones and put a better system in."	0
"I bought this to replace a 2-year old Xperia U, which I liked but the screen was too small for typing and internet, the battery was on the light side, the Android version was kinda old and couldn't be updates, and it lacked LTE  The SP remediates all these issues.  It is also a bit thinner (but not flimsy).  It is a much peppier processor and the newer version of Android (4.3) has some very nice features.  The battery consumption is much slower, in part because of ""wifi off"" feature when out of range.  The 4G internet is about 10% of the speed of a full-fl,edged ethernet wire which is great, the GPS performance is much improved.  Newer versions of gmail and other apps compatible with later android are a great improvement.  There are a couple of sour notes.  I liked the old ""U"" wallpapers better.  The phone dialer was a very aggravating habit of screen blanking when the proximity sensor approaches your ear, then not responding to ""wake up"" when the call is over.  You can override this by changing the  ""end call"" to the side power button, but its a bug either in the app or the the OS.  The other thing is the phone is white and I ordered black -- but buying from Hong Kong those kind of things happen, the vendor at least agreed to refund a few buck so I could buy a different color ca"	0
"I bought this to replace my old droid that I really liked and didn&apos;t want to pay the price for a brand new droid.  I really like this droid bionic - even though it came out 2 years ago,it was brand new and a fantastic price.  The seller extended my warranty to 60 days.  It is working like a charm."	1
"I bought this to replace the identical model which I loved, but dropped.  Spent the extra money to get the dual processor because I liked the speed of the old phone.  First thing when I went to restore data from my old phone, iTunes forced me to upgrade the software.  It refused do restore my data unless I complied with its demands. The new OS brought the phone to it's knees.  Typing response is in slow motion to the point of aggravating.  And, as if Apple wanted to briskly rub salt into my wound using a wire brush, the new OS nags me constantly to upgrade the OS yet again, and nags me constantly to validate my Apple credentials, and nags me to log into iCloud.  Same model phone I used to love, is now so infuriating that I want to throw it against the wall every time I use it.  Good bye 10 year relationship with iPhones."	0
I bought this to use as an Ipod touch. works great for music and nice having extra phone.	1
"I bought this used and it is in absolutely pristine condition! The battery has some wear to be expected from a used iphone, but the seller has amazing communication, was very descriptive and helpful, and I received an iphone that literally looks brand new!"	1
"I bought this used, never again!  I had the same phone which has worked wonderful.  After contacting the seller twice about not receiving the phone (weeks after paying for it) I did finally get it in the mail.  The phone I received was much more &quot;used&quot; than described and quit working after only a week!  I again tried to make contact with the seller, to inform them the phone didn&apos;t work and again didn&apos;t get a reply.  Since I didn&apos;t hear anything from the seller I purchased a new battery and it still won&apos;t work.  Now apparently I am &quot;stuck&quot; with this phone that doesn&apos;t work!? I Love my original phone and would highly recommend it.  However, my advice- buy a new one from a much more RELIABLE seller!"	0
"I bought three of these phones and within one month two had died.  I e-mailed seller and his reply was for $20 each he would service them for me.  What a racket! I would not recommend buying on line, there&apos;s no history on these phones, you don&apos;t know what your getting.  The seller wants more money to repair a phone he probably knew had problems to begin with.  Most complaints I read on line were that the phones were probably water damaged!  Buyer beware..."	0

I bought two charging port broke on both after two months had one repaired broke again. Asus should recall this phone 	0
I bought two of them one for USA and other for travelling one worked but when I was leaving the country and put in the sim card in the other one it never worked because it was stuck at itune app when I tried to exchange it the seller completely refused to do so I would never buy a phone on EBay because they never tried to help by intervening by telling the seller to exchange it.	0
"I bought two of these phones as replacements for friends stuck in contracts and not eligible for upgrades.  I like the metal casing for durability, but since they are now kids&apos; play phones, who cares about durability.  These phones do not have the e911 chip and cannot be activated. Buyer beware!"	0

"I brought this phone for a guy who liked it and needed a cell phone that he was comfortable with after losing his because of damage.  I opt for him to get another one, yet he insisted on the Nokia 6085.  The phone has a cool feature that allows someone to send a voice text, other than this I don&apos;t really know all the features because I do not use it.  So far, the cell phone exceeded all expectations from the user and remain a solid product on the cheap for the consumer."	1

"I buy the product as desribed by seller but is not.  The seller accepts that sent another phone with communication we have done initially with messages. I clearly read description - Excellent condition and 9.5/10 . The phone came to me with more scratches and  burnt in image in the LCD screen. If you want, i can show you real photos, to see change. This seller is fraudulent,  irresponsible!! Bad experience,bad business with this seller."	0
"I buy this iphone because someone does not have eBay account and he ask me to buy for him in eBay and he pay this item by himself.  To me, this lack-of-features-yet-expensive iphone is not worth for my hard-earned money. Other cellular vendor, such as Samsung or LG could provide same or even more features for much cheaper price.   For example, LG Arena KM900 price US$170-US$180 has any features similar to iphone&apos;s US$500. That&apos;s only 33% for the similar features!"	0

"I buyed this product as an original, used Samsung SGG-G800, which I know from several years as a quality product.  Unfortunately, the seller sent me some other kind of Samsung, some cheap scrap, ready for the rubbish. I even don&apos;t know the models name.   My old Samsung SGH-G800 still works perfect, but will need to be replaced quite soon I guess, Highly recommended to person who loves old style mobiles."	1
"I came from using the Samsung Galaxy note 2 and the Samsung Galaxy note 5. When I had to upgrade I ended up with the LG V30. It's a great p phone but there is something about the stylus. I'm one of those people that must have it. The phone is very snappy even after doing the LG new device restore. It's a very smooth device. Cameras are very very decent, specially with a separate camera app. I highly recommend this phone. Its excellent! The 720p display is very crisp and bright. I have no complaints at all. "	1

The Ascend freezes up all the time and is always running low on &quot;phone&quot; memory and therefore runs slow. I moved all of my downloaded apps to my memory card and still have no memory."	0
I can not use it. I updated it and can not use it unless I have a Sim. do not know carrier and Cant get a Sim that size	0
I can not use this phone because the seller sold me a locked phone. It will not even work with a Cingular sim card. It will not work with any sim card. It is a paper weight. it is totally useless to me.	0

"I can see why the company has stopped working on the software.  Unusable as a daily driver.  Phone restarts a lot.  Luckily,  it restarts very quickly.  Apps are almost worthless compared to other OS apps.  It's interesting and I wanted to try all OS'S.  "	0

It is in super good condition, even had the original box!  Shipping time was fast, and they were very understanding when my payment was late due to computer issues.  I will definitely buy from this Seller again, and highly recommend them to anyone else!"	1
"I can&apos;t tell you about my experience using the ZTE Groove because I keep telling you people that, I never received it. The owner has the phone and my money and you have done nothing about it. I have always had my address of 2627 n.51st ave. apt#254 phoenix, az. 85035 for the last 2 or more years. I had a issue where some sellers didn&apos;t have my apartment number attached. I was doning business with several sellers, so i just just did a email to all of them, making sure they had the same information. Then you guys denied my claim and acted as I gave the wrong info. I know my address, and i didn&apos;t type it wrong. Then you guys block me from continuing the claim."	0

I found one and paid for it, but when I received the item and was checking it out I found that I was shipped an STV 100-1 instead. I contacted the seller and was told they accidentally shipped me the wrong phone, they offered a refund, but we agreed that as soon as they find another STV 100-3 we will make a switch. Up to this point the seller has been cooperative, now I'm waiting to see if and when and how long it takes the seller to fulfill his promise and obligation, and makes the correction to this problem.

"I compared the specs of this phone with several other high end phones (Samsung s, iPhone) before buying and found that it has very good specs. Bought it two weeks ago and confirmed this is a great phone. All apps I have tried work fine and the phone responds fast and has enough memory. All for a very affordable price. Couldn't be happier with this Moto G5. "	1
I contacted already two companies to get unlock code for this device and it is not available!!!	0
I contacted the seller before purchase to make sure that this phone would work with my Verizon plan. (Not prepaid). They assured me it would. I bought the phone and Verizon could not activate it. I contacted the seller again for a refund. They wanted to keep 30% as a restocking fee. Never buy from these people.	0
I could never use the cell phone it does not work is defective	0
I could not be happier. I would recommend this cell phone to anyone. I am not happy about having to leave 100 characters for this review.	1

"i couldn&apos;t believe how fast i received the phone. I ordered it friday afternoon and had it monday morning. The phone was in mint condition also, if i ever need another phone i will make sure to order it form them!"	1
I couldn&apos;t contact the seller when I needed to.I ordered a 16gb 3g iphone($330) but it came in a 16 3gs box. The phone conditions was perfect from outside EXCEPT when I turned it on. THE HOME BUTTON IS BROKEN. I was really disappointed and I wanted to contact to seller but couldn&apos;t. I had to replaced a new home button. The phone is a little slow. The accessories are NOT apple&apos;s original and the qualities are really bad(earphones). The shipping was really fast. The price was good comparing to the apple store but the BROKEN HOME BUTTON really pissed me off. I had to turn off my phone every time when i wanted to go back.	0
I couldnt download more than one app. When the phone was turned off and turned back on the apps wouldn't open for 15+ min. Instead saying app isn't installed. This phone ended up obliterated due the frustration that came along with it. 	0
"I couldnt tell you about the product, it was never received.  After payment was taken from my bank account, an email was sent saying the sender had cancelled the transaction.  To this day, there has been no reimbursement, and still no product."	0
I couldn't use the phone because it's not compatiable with anyone this phone was a waste of money 	0
I currently own a G5 so the V20 was a natural upgrade. LG makes great phones with easy and intuitive interfaces. I wanted this specific phone because I can root and mod it to my heart's content. Definitely recommend. 	1

I decide to buy this phone because i love all the helio phones and the things that i can do with them. I&apos;ve been with Helio for about 1 year and a half and i know how to work around the system. I don&apos;t have to call the company so they can connect my new phone that i got on ebay. I read some reviews where people say that the company can&apos;t connect your phone that you bought here on ebay. Well good news to all those people. I&apos;m here to help you with any problem you may have. Well i hope my review helps anyone trying to buy a HELIO phone	1
I decided to be this phone because I loved the quality of the blackberry. The sellers description was straight forward and the price was very reasonable.	1
I decided to buy another NOKIA 8910 from the same seller as I already bought one before and was really happy as it was 100% original and good value for money. To my great suprise the second phone I received was absolute chinese fake. I was really disapointed by this fact and sent the phone back. I haven&apos;t received any refund yet. I don&apos;t recommend dealing with this seller as you never know what would you recieve in the end.	0
I decided to buy it because I wanted one really..I rated this poor because I never recieved the phone and the person still has money...not very happy!	0

i decided to buy the Blackberry 8330 for u.s. cellular because it was a great price for me! The phone works great and i do not have problems with it at all. I do love how the shipping was free and fast!  Thanks.	1
I decided to buy the phone as a replacement phone for my husband. Nowhere in the phone discription did it say the phone did not need a smartcard. Any AT&amp;T customer knows that all the phones now have to have a card and this phone does not require one so basically I WASTED my money and time on this purchase because I can not even use it.	0
"I decided to buy the product because I needed a new phone as mine was no longer working.   I read the description of the item carefully and found that it was something I could use. &quot;Verizon phone in good working condition.&quot;      When I recevied the product I found that the description was misrepresented and was in fact a phone that had water damage.  The description never mentioned that the phone had water damage.    There is an area on all cell phones where you can check for damage: A small circle on the inside of the phone can indicate damage.  A phone in good working condition has a white circle, a phone with water damage has a pink circle.  Upon my receipt of the phone I looked and even called Verizon directly to verify this.  The phone I received had water damage, therefore I rate this product poor."	0
i decided to buy this mobile phone as i really wanted a flip phone and i know from experience that nokias are very reliable. i love the pink pattern on the phone. this is a great little phone.	1
"I decided to buy this phone beacause I needed a new phone that let me go online and check my email. I enjoyed this phone for the 3 days that I had it, but then it stoppped working, so it was not worth the purchase."	0
I decided to buy this phone because I love nokia phones andbecause it has wifi but am not happy with it because the music is inexcessable as it is constantly searching and the only way to get out of it is to switch the phone off. So overall not happy.	0
"I decided to buy this phone because I was tired of my HTC Hero and This was the best phone I&apos;ve ever owned from Sprint... Upon receiving the phone I was very excited! After a day, the phone would not charge. The charger that was sent to me with the phone would not work and the chargers I had on hand would not work. It was then I decided to return it, but my grandmother thought she might want it to I kept it a few more days. We charged put it on the charger all day and once we returned it was still not charged.     Another thing was that the phone was very slow than what I am used to. I don&apos;t remember the phone being as slow as it is, but then again I have gotten used to touch screen and 3G phones... all in all it&apos;s a great phone for someone inexperienced with phones but it is not for me and I certainly wouldn&apos;t purchase it off of ebay. A waste of my 36 dollars"	0
I DECIDED TO BUY THIS PHONE BECAUSE MY BROTHERS PHONE BROKE. I OPENED THIS PACKAGE AND THIS PHONE IS ANCIENT AND WOULD NOT EVEN POWER ON. I ACTUALLY THREW IT AWAY!	0
i decided to buy this phone because of it&apos;s features plus it looks good. but when i received it and opened the box the phone looked little old because it had wearing signs. it wasnt good as new. now the camera turns on by itself and phone becomes unlocked by itself. it seems like the phone has malfunction problem.	0

"I decided to buy this phone for the price but there is no saying truer than &quot;YOU BUY WHAT YOU PAY FOR&quot; It is a very small phone for my hands, the fonts and numbers as well as the keys are just too small for me and the numbers and contacts are tiny. Everything is tiny..too tiny for my liking..Boy do I regret spending my hard earned money on this piece of junk!!!"	0
I decided to buy this stove to try and cut down on my heating bills. I am so happy I chose this seller he is very honest if you cant get ahold of him leave a message and he returns you calls right away. I am so pleased. Item was exactly as stated.

"I decided to get the Motorola RAZR because there had been so much talk about how good the phone was, etc. I was excited to get it, but soon found myself disappointed. Battery life is horrible. It needs to sit on a charger for hours a day. The memory on the phone is also poor. The picture quality is poor. The ring tones are cool, though. It is VCast ready, but VCast isn&apos;t available in my area, and plus I don&apos;t know that I would want to pay for that service anyway. I&apos;m kind of sold on i-tunes. I don&apos;t know if the newer RAZRs have these issues, but I would definately steer clear from purchasing the RAZR V3."	0
I decided to purchase a phone from this seller because they had pretty good reviews but Everyone please stay away from this seller. This person is a horrible communicator. Never responds to any messages and lied about shipping item. Doesnt know how to do business properly. I advise anyone not to buy ANYTHING from this seller. This is the first time this has ever happen to me. 	0
I decided to purchase the phone from this seller instead of Amazon where it was cheaper because they were claiming to have one day delivery. my receipt even said one day delivery so I ordered it.  I ended up receiving it 7 Days Later and in the box with the phone I purchased was my gift receipt from Amazon where they had purchased the phone after my order. So the phone I passed up because I didn't want to wait a week for it to be delivered is currently mine but I paid quite a bit more for it because I believed there promise of a quick delivery.  That's one hell of a scam if you ask me!  So if recommend anybody considering purchasing from this so-called company to just cut out the middleman and just order it from Amazon yourself!!	0
"I defy anyone to show me a BLU cellphone with a working audio port / headphone jack, let alone any BLU supplied ear buds that have functioned for more than 3 weeks.  BLU seems to have some problems with the little fiddly hardware bits that deal with charging the battery and providing audio output.    This is an ongoing and proven hardware  problem with BLU phones, not to mention BLU's inept,  corrupt and greedy implementation of Android 6.0 and BLU-NextRadio's FM spam Shop Surveillance implempentation.

I did a lot of research and decided that this phone was the best for the price. I wanted a phone with a battery that I could replace and this is one of the few phones that still have a replaceable battery. 	1
"I did buy this phone thinking it was brand new, then whwn i used it when i would type it wouldn't work and the colors on my screen were glitching. I decided to take it to the Apple store and they told me it's not new but that it was refurbished. I told them how can I fix the problem, and they told me it will cost me $180 to fix the screen. WARNING ALL BUYERS TO NEVER PURCHASE FROM THIS PERSON, THEY WILL SCAM YOU.   "	0
"I did like all the feature but, Have had 3 different ones. All 3 had the touch screen go out. I would not recommend this phone to anyone."	0
"I did lots of research from professional reviewers as well as users from various sites(all different users). The LG Rumor Touch was rated mostly 4 to 5 stars with users very pleased with phone especially for price. After purchasing and before activating it I studied manual to familiarize myself with features.  After activating it I was fairly pleased but still uncomfortable with some features. However, after about two and a half weeks of use I noticed the terrible battery life, letters skipping over each other in texts, failure to swap and return to previous caller, dropped calls, and having to remove the battery several times in order to get a text to send. There are several other instances that happen but mostly the ones mentioned were enough that I had to purchase another phone and could not return this phone as it was past the time allotted.  I would have to say this is one of the poorest decisions I have made in purchasing a cell phone in all of the 25 plus years that I have had a cell phone. I would never recommend this phone to anyone no matter what reviews or ratings. I am only sorry that I wasted money that I had budgeted for since I live on social security. The fact that I live on social security in no means insinuates that I am not savvy in the uses and terminology of technology used as I am very computer knowledgeable with software. hardware and technical applications necessary to be very competent with any programs I use or how to take care of most technical issues that do not require a complete adjustment by professionals. I am telling you this so there is no question that I was not operating this phone improperly. It is just not a phone I would EVER recommend to anyone and quite frankly wish I had never purchased it. I have purchased another phone and feel that I will enjoy using my new phone and all of the applications available to me."	0
I did not buy this item. My ebay account was compromised. I have informed ebay and the sellers many times...now I am asked to &quot;REVIEW&quot;. What is up with this technology?    Don Anderson	0
"I did not check immediately after i got it,but as soon i could i unpacked and tried to charge the battery that came with.For some reason,while charging ,on top left of the screen a light came on,which shows a failure of some kind,and also the phone will warm up.Being afraid of maybe an explosion like some previous models,getting in fire,i did took a picture of the screen with the light on,sent to the seller,and did not got a response.After that i purchased another battery OEM,put this one in ,charged again,and during the charging again the red light on the top left came on.I wrote again to the seller and explaining ,and ask him for a refund.Of Course he did not say anything. After that i took the phone to a place where they fix phones, for a evaluation.They got into the phone,and found a shorth?? and told me that the phone it is defective,and to replace the parts will be 125.00 dollars. I decided not to fix it,and because the time went by i could not return it,so i decided to take a loss,and do not buy from this seller anything.Beside i left him at receiving a 5 star positive feedback,hopping that the cellphone will be ok.I made a mistake by doing that,he knew what he sold me, and as a result he did not leave me a feedback ,buying his defective phone made me think more about buyi"	0
"I did not end up buying this phone because, the seller did not answer all my questions and prior to paying for the phone I was asked if I had a question for the seller....so I clicked on that.  I asked the seller the same question, was the phone locked or unlocked? She did not answer prior to winning the bid and she finally answerd it was a unlocked phone. I told her I wanted a locked phone. We both were ok with the seller reselling the phone. She was a new member and I guess she didn&apos;t know to answer buyers questions. I thought after communicating with the seller it was hard to get a simple question answered from her. She sold it to someone else."	0
i did not get it. this was a scam!! and trying now to get my money back...... this is crazy. i dont understand how this can happen on ebay!	0
I did not get the phone when I found out that you had to buy a plan with the phone. So when I thought that I was getting the phone at a really good price I was not getting a deal at all. And I would not buy from this person again.	0
I did not get this item sence 3 months   I buy money but i did not get it	0
"I did not have a black phone, but a blue one. It was a pre-pay phone, which was not explained before my purchase. I had a post pay account, so I had to switch to a pre-pay account before I could use it. It also cuts off for no reason, which is a defect. The seller did not offer me a solution so that I would not be without service while awaiting a replacement, which did not please me at all. I do not recommend a phone that shuts off by itself for no reason."	0
"I did not like it because it was not all that. It was just like the behold. Anyway, it wasn&apos;t all that great."	0
"I did not like the fact that they only accepted same day payment, (which they got) no refunds only exchanges and once I got the phone the earpiece didnt work. The description said the phone had been tested and worked great. When I reached out to them to them let them know of the inconvenience this had caused me, they told me the phone had been tested twice before it got to me and asked me questions like I didnt know what I was doing. I explained to them I had a deadline however, this meant absolutely nothing them. Ill never do business with them again...terrible customer service."	0
I did not like the phone at all. The seller was quick to get an attitude with me. The phone was hardly working. I had to pay about 40 dollars to get the phone fixed. Then 1 week later it broke for good. The only reaason I bought this phone was becuase I needed it temporarily until I could save up for the one I wanted!	0
I did not like the phone I ordered. So I sent it back to the seller immediately after receiving it. The phone was hard to use. We should have called it like a pressphone and not touchphone.	0
"I did not like the phone, although there was nothing wrong with it functionaaly,it had too many scratches and looked too beat up.I purchase the phone for my daughter and now im planning on returning the phone and purchasing another phone."	0
I did not like this phone at all! It did not work with my cingular sim card. Seller said that it was cingular but it was at&amp;t. Gave the phone to my five year old to throw around a little! Waste of time and money!	0
I did not order the phone....my cc was hacked on ebay	0

I did not realize it was a prepaid phone and Verizon would not turn it on in my account. It is now a paperweight on my desk. The ad did not say pre-paid or it was not made apparent.	0
I did not receive a product for which I paid.	0
"I did not receive it yet! In discription of item Seller said : shipping by UPS Express Mail. But I did not receive any tracking #.I think shipping by UPS Express must be very fast ??Then I asked Seleer for tracking #,he stopped any communication. So I did not receive no respond nither item."	0
"I did not receive the phone that was listed in the ad. When I finally received a response some days later the seller said oh&quot;, I don&apos;t know the difference between the two different bands and just used a typical ad listed by ebay. I did not have a phone for two weeks. His other response was to call him, I could not, being the phone&apos;s band he sent me was not compatible with my carrier. So sorry, I bought a different phone from a reputable dealer. Case fact, won&apos;t ever use ebay to buy a phone again. Waste of time and money. And, went to long without phone service, missed a new job offer cause I could not retrieve my messages until new phone and too late by then."	0
"I did not receive the product.  Fedx lost it and said it was delivered. So I cannot rate it as ANYTHING but POOR,"	0
"I did not receive this item and both the seller and eBay refused to assist with rectifying this matter, it said delivered to hotel mailbox but I never received the item, we have since left the hotel and no one attempted to get to the bottom of this, doesn't the hotel have cameras to even do a small inquiry to determine what happened to this item?"	0
"I did not receive this phone, hence no review. This is the second auction I won and the seller refunds my money for no reason that I was made aware of.    Thank you Ebay. I sure hope i will win an auction and then decide not to pay. That will fine with Ebay I hope."	0

"I did purchase this product because I was leaving the country for 6+ months.  So I needed an unlocked phone.  The delivery was on point and received before expected.  However once I charged the device, it was fine until the charge died completely.  Leading to an unusable device, because it would no longer charge."	0
I DID RETURN THE SAMSUNG GALAXY EXHILARATE SGH-I577. I DIDN&apos;T USE YOUR SHIPPING LABEL. I PAID THE RETURN SHIPPING MYSELF.	0
"i did&apos;nt get this item when i pay for the item,because i win in the action , i sun i win i send my paiment, but i did&apos;nt recieved, . I recived a note that tell me the item has a problem and they will refaund my money back"	0
"i didn&apos;t bought it, someone hacked into my account and they made the order when i communicate with the seller and explain what happen she refused to cancel the order."	0
"I didn&apos;t compare store prices because my husband&apos;s cell phone broke and I needed to replace it right away.  We live in a very rural area.  In the package when I received my purchase, there was a WalMart invoice for ABOUT HALF OF WHAT I PAID.  Seller scammed me and when I mentioned it to her she was extremely rude and basically laughed at me and called me an idiot.  For what it was worth (not much I&apos;m assuming), I reported her.  I&apos;m sure nothing came of it.  I have not purchased anything from Ebay since and am very reluctant to do so.  Seems Ebay has been taken over by retail sellers with nothing but greed as their motivation.  I now use BooCoo.com.  For the time being, it&apos;s just honest people like myself trying to sell/purchase items.  BEWARE EBAY&apos;ERS."	0
I didn&apos;t get full flashed and they advertised a full flash so now I have to get a full flash and pay more will not buy from this buyer again!!!!!!!	0
"i didn&apos;t get iphone 5S 32GB ulocked and new, instaed i got from this seller  iphone 5 16GB locked, that can&apos;t be used"	0
I didn&apos;t get the phone. Seller refunded the money after he  tested the iphone. I thought that was a new Iphone ! - After that I ordered one by Virgin mobile.	0
I didn&apos;t like it . its Junk  The phone dosn&apos;t have any standard condition no menue no explain   A the most important thing it doesn&apos;t have original box	0
"I didn&apos;t love, or like anything about this transaction.  I received this phone, it has water damage, the cover where you plug your charger in is broken, and there was pornography on the video part of this phone.  I am stuck with a phone that doesn&apos;t work and never will.  Then on top of it under the seller&apos;s feedback he wrote stuff to make ME look bad.  This is the kind of seller we all hope to avoid on EBAY.  Paid a lot of money for this phone and was just straight taken advantage of.  But whatever!"	0
I didn&apos;t purchase this phone.  The one I bought is LG Optimus Dynamic Android phone.  It said it comes with 600 minutes and triple minutes benefit with Tracfone. But it isn&apos;t.	0
I didn&apos;t receive my product. A waste of money. I hop Ebay can resolve my problem soon cause I seen some things I would like to purchase on here but until then I will not be using Ebay.	0
"i didn&apos;t receive the phone when i bought it, the post office lost it and i lost my money, what a waste of money and ebay didnt do anything to fight back"	0
I didn&apos;t want to move up into the current 2010 cell phones yet.  I just love the razr - hope motorola brings it back with some better online speed and adds a querty keyboard.  This is just a great user friendly phone. Until then - found one just like the one I had.  Happy!	1
I didn't buy it because it's to expensive but I imagine it is amazing. Hopefully I can get it soon. 	1
I didnt buy that phone because it is locked to AT&T I was trying to buy a unlock phone I gave Ebay a try but they drop the ball so I bought one from bestbuy	0
"I didn't even get the product. I came home and found a torn up package in my lawn.(content of the package gone) I tried contacting the seller but he couldn't do anything because the package said ""delivered"". I asked for my money back at least but he could not do so. Do not buy from this seller. He's just trying to make a quick buck and doesn't care what happens with the phone. NOT EVEN IF YOU DON'T GET IT. I would give 0 stars if I could."	0
"I didn't expect the battery life to be great because it's a used phone, and it's been about two years since Google first released this model. However, the phone would shut off anywhere between 95% and 20%. As it was shutting off, it said that the battery was at 0%, and the phone would refuse to turn back on (as though it actually didn't have any juices left). The phone was therefore unusable as it could shut off 5 min after unplugging from a full charge. Buyers, beware! This is apparently a common problem for Nexus users who had their phones for about 1-2 years."	0
I didnt get it yet. So I do not know how good it is yet or if i like it or dislike it because i have not received my ebay item yet. I have been waiting on it since November the nineteenth.	0

I didn't use the phone right away but when I did it worked great for a very short while. Then the phone died on me. I contacted the seller they said it was too late to return. I will never purchase from this seller again!	0

I dislike it I keep having problems with it and now the phone is not in working condition. I tried taking the battery out and placing it back in to see will it come on. Its only been a month &amp; I have to take it to AT&amp;T to see whats the problem.	0
"I dislike that I lost $55.00 on this purchase, filed a complaint and had no response, paypal did not refund me my money."	0
I dislike the fact i bought a blue rumor touch off these guys and they shipped me a god damn purple one. Terrible service.	0
I dislike the fact that I have to yell into the phone so that the person on the other end can hear me.  There is abviously a defect in this phone.  This is directly related to the condition of the phone when I purchased it.  From that time until now this condidtion has existed no matter the noise in the surrounding environment.	0
"I dislike the seller didn&apos;t reveal the true. This cell is high end from Motorola,but made in China with no name and no guarranty at all. It cost me deduct 20% off my payment plus cost shiping.now I am scare the market sellers."	0
"I dislike this ebayer because they tried selling something that was broke, I did the buy it now and purchased the phone, they then contact me two days later and say the battery is dead. So I said send the phone and I will get a new battery. They refunded my purchase without my consent and I was stuck with new batteries on the way that I purchased and no phone. Terreble ebayer that advertises false items. Advise no one to do business with this company or individual beacuse you will be disappointed."	0
"I dislike this mobile phone because it is a fake and locked because it is either stolen or faulty, however it is banned by Chania and the Royal mail refuse to send it back to chaina."	0
I disliked because as the auction was unlocked but this version of baseband can&apos;t unlocked so is better check seriously all the specifications before sell something...  ps read and write very carefully about unlocked...jailbreaking is easy...  http://www.blogsdna.com/12337/downgrade-ios-4-1-baseband-05-14-2-to-ios-4-0-baseband-05-13-4-using-fuzzyband-downgrader.htm	0
i disliked the swivling camera because i fliped open the phone one day and the top snaped off. worst phone ive ever had.  i would recomend that u dont buy this phone unless ur SUPER gentle!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	0
I disliked this item because it had scratches all over it and i tried to activate it and they say they couldn&apos;t activate it because they never heard of Telos before.	0
"I disliked this phone because, when I got the phone it worked just fine, but then it started to die and I plugged my charger into the phone and it wouldn&apos;t charge. So now I have to find a new phone with a good charger."	0

"I do mobile tech support and dread the iPhone calls, Apple does alot of ""updates"" (patches) and now some iPhone 7's were recalled for hardware issue and the 6's have battery issues. Apple also intentionally slowed down data on their phones. Mine wouldn't connect to wifi and wouldn't work on some apps, like my Canon app.  I suggest a Samsung Galaxy S, not an off model like the J7 and other downgraded Samsungs.  "	1
I do not have any complaint at all. Very good Gadget for me.	1
"I do not know too much about this model phone, it is a good stylish two-tone, black and silver,  GSM phone that can be used with several carriers."	1
"I do not know, have not received my product! I bought on 20.07.2012 and 09.10.2012 to this day has not arrived! I tried to contact the seller, but he called me back!"	0
"I do not like that it is actually a Metro PCS phone, so it has metro pcs apps all through it. Yet, it says not compatible with metro... Seems to me like they are stolen and being sold..."	0
"I do not like the key arrangement, too close together and too small other brands are 200% better. I also found the battery to be too short lived compared to other phones I have had"	0
"i do not like this phone at all ;it does nothing,i expected more out of this phone,and i am not getting anything,my htc hd2 did more than this product by far,i have not been this disappointed since the razor phone,all i wanted was to video stream a live program,hd7 doesnot video stream(didnot know that),i am really not pleased at all"	0

I do not recommend the phone came in with the bottom halfway off and terrible battery life  	0
"I do not regret buying this phone because I really like this type of phone after breaking my old cell phone. My old cell phone is exactly the one I have bought. I do not like Samsung or LG in the stores right now. I wanted a Motorola because it&apos;s a good brand plus it&apos;s the model I can hear better than Samsung or LG models.    I thought &apos;Yay! I can take my old SIM card into the new one and I&apos;ll be set!&apos;  *buzzer* Nope, it doesn&apos;t work that way. You have to call Tracfone to get a new SIM card (it&apos;s free) and get it activated.     I&apos;m happy with my purchase."	1
I DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW A SELLER CAN HAVE ALL THESE STARS {RATING} WHEN MY CELL PHONE ARRIVED NOT BARELY USED. ALSO IT WAS THROWN IN A BIG BOX WITH NO WRAPPING AT ALL TO KEEP IT FROM GETTING BANGED UP.	0
I do not wish to write a review at this time.  I was not able to delete the option to write a review so I am writing this stupid paragraph.	0
i don&apos;t care for the phone joystick.it makes it very difficult to use. it was a good deal though so i will keep the phone for now to serve as a temp. the seller is very professional but personable with excellant communication skills. she answers questions very prompt and handles her transactions with great care.	1
"I don&apos;t glad with all. I had bought a new phone,  because the phone was enough old.   I hope that they can down the prices."	0

I don&apos;t like this phone.  If someone calls you will never know because I doesn&apos;t say &quot;missed calls&quot;.  If someone leaves you a message you won&apos;t know unless you check your messages.  The display light keeps getting dim.  I don&apos;t like the phone.	0
"I don&apos;t like to post negative reviews without first contacting the seller to correct the problem, however I cannot find a way to contact the seller other than through a review. I purchased this phone on 2nd january, it arrived on 8th january, as soon as the sim was inserted i got INVALID IMEI, I am hoping to be contacted by the seller and have this situation rectified as soon as possible so I can change my review and possibly conduct future purchases........NEED SELLERS HELP ASAP"	0
"I don&apos;t recommend this seller!! At first I was pleased with delivery and everything. But after I went to purchase a carrier chip in order to start using it, I found out the cellphone was a FAKE! Yes everyone! Blackberry won&apos;t even recognize the device IMEI! Quite a scam, I tried to get a response from this seller and NOTHING!!!"	0

"I don't greatly recommend this seller, but you can try to experience in your own. I bought 3 cellphone , they sent me phones that are different from the image and one without a battery. WHen I told them that, they sent me another battery but smaller. "	0
"I dont kno why eBay dont have rules for seller and punish them! Seller just killed me with his bad words in message, he took money and refund so why he did like that? Coz he dont have iPhone to sale at all and eBay allow this kinda scam seller to list the things, this seller should be punished or jailed, seller played with me n my money like game so again he messaged me and told me that he call eBay and ebay gonna block me from PayPal  so whats is this? Why eBay is allowing this kinda bad works from seller to good buyer? "	0
"I dont know how the phone is supposed to function but there have been sooooo many problems from the first few days I got it. Black screen for no reason, wont allow me to save new numbers, numbers not coming up with names even though they are in my address book and a few other issues too. I have bought a brand new phone from the company before and had to go thru 3 before getting one that acted right so it could be manufactering errors. It would seem to me I just got a bum phone with many problems but beware."	0
I dont know if i like it because i still haven&apos;t recieved it after waiting almost 3 weeks for something that should&apos;ve been here in 5 days	0
I dont know if it just  was the one i got or what but it freezes  at least 3 timrs a day and i have to fight with it to get  it to turn back on would have stayed with my old broken phone	0
"I don't know what a small form factor is.  Anyway it is a great phone, great customer service, for me Ebay is for phones!  What a great value, I couldn't be more pleased with my phone purchases from Ebay!"	1
I dont know what Small form factor is. But I know I love this phone. Transaction was perfect. Delivery ahead of time. Answered questions timely. I would use this seller again. 	1

I dont recommend this phone at all! Unfortunately I honestly cant tell you one single good thing that I liked about it.	0
I dont see other 	0
"I dont think Ill advise anyone to buy. The phone goes off and on on its own. I mean you could just be using the phone and in the next minute, it goes off and come back on again just like that. Sometimes in the middle of a phone call even. Also while charging. "	0
i don't want cause it for parts need one that work 	0
"I don't want to walk around with my face in my phone.  I go online at home on my computer.  I don't want to go online on my phone.  I want to text and make calls and just want a dependable phone that I'm not constantly having to download new updates just to keep it working, which is what I had to do with the i-phone I just got rid of.  This is a great, easy to use phone.  When the battery is charged it lasts for days.  I love it."	1
I don't write reviews. But this product wasn't  what I ordered. I wont be doing business with them again.	0
"i doubt it&apos;s a real nokia.. poorly built, and not working phone. returned it after receiving. maybe it was just my unit, or maybe not. customer service was okay though."	0
"i em bery happy with this pradoct.it has tv, radio,cell phone,wifi,musice,fotos,voice recorder,games and olat more you name it i loved."	1
"I emailed this seller to ask if this phone was compatible with Sprint since it was unlocked. Never answered, so l assumed it was since it was unlocked. Later found out it was not. Contacted seller, waste of time. Buyer beware of this seller, rip off. I'm filing a claim with eBay"	0
I ended up returning this phone. I liked the design of the phone. But the features are really outdated compared to the phones that are out on the market now. I would get something a little newer instead of paying for this phone.	0
"I enjoy this mini cell phone. It takes pictures, emails, has real ring tones, browses the web, amung other things! thanks for such a great product and the prompt delivery! I would buy from this seller again!"	1
I enjoy using my phone more because the 6 in display is easier to use. holds charge well. newer version of android easier to use. Love the phone for the price. 	1
"I expected a phone that I could use right out of the box.  Instead, I found:  1..The keys are so small I have a hard time seeing them.  2..The keya are so small I have a hard time using them.  3..The Ovi map did not work, so I went to the Tmobile store &amp; spent 2 hours with them, &amp; never got it working."	0
"I expected screen burn, but I wish there was a notation about what exactly is was burned. In this case, it was someone's porn search in the search bar . Otherwise it was as described. "	0
"I expected to get a good deal on this product. However, everything was wrong.  I true piece of crap. Do not buy from this person. Not reliable!!!!"	0
"I FEEL LIKE EBAY BETRAYED ME. I NEVER RECEIVED THE ITEM AND GOT ROBBED FOR $170. EBAY&amp;apos;S SOLE DEFENSE IS THAT THE SELLER SHIPPED THE ITEM WITH CONFIRMATION. AS OF TODAY, NO PHONE AND BUNCHES OF EMAILS FROM AN IMMATURE SELLER STATING HE TOOK MY MONEY.  WILL HAVE TO PROCEED WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS. IT IS SAD, VERY SAD TO SEE HOW EBAY TURNS ITS BACK TO THE PEOPLE THAT DO HONEST BUSINESS AND PAY THE FEES DILIGENTLY."	0
i feel like i didn't get what i paid for because it wasn't connected to boost mobile like it said it was and the speakers are busted so most of the time i can't even hear anything out of the speakers except screeching so 10/10 would NOT RECOMMEND 	0
"I feel that I am cheated. Why? This gadget was advertised as fully operational; however, such a statement was FAKE! Why Fake? Because, the Battery life was entirely DEPLETED, and needed REPLACEMENT, however, sold to escape the REPLACEMENT responsibility and sold as fully functional. That is outright CHEATING to gullible ones like myself. I regret my haste Approval for Good. Now, am forwarding to: Apple for at least its Battery Change, its estimated Costs are: US$79,00 + ($6,95 for Return shipping) + SEK200,00 (for forwarding postal charges). I fully regret for my buying such second hand garbages. How much more would I need to purchase a Brand New from Apple Resellers?"	0
I felt lucky to have found this phone. It is new and in great shape. 	1
I finally gave up trying to program this phone.  Blackberry&apos;s are not for technically challenged persons!  I feel too stupid for this &quot;smart phone&quot;.	0
"I find the phone is excellent, backs up well to my Google account. Battery life is great. I've found a factory reset periodically helps the phone to run cooler. I switched from iPhone & wouldn't switch back. I don't know how apple can charge so much for a phone when there are such good reasonably priced alternatives out there."	1
"I first charges it, took it to the AT&T store to switch Sims. I then used it 1 hour before it locked up and would not turn on."	0
"I fought with a samsung galaxy s7 for a year and could never get the default samsung apps working the way I wanted. The battery life was atrocious and despite many attempts including factory resets I was never able to resolve the problem. This LG immediately solved all those problems. I've had the phone for a few weeks and the battery life is at least double the samsung, if not more."	1
"I found Motorola&apos;s new W490, to be everything I&apos;ve looked for in a small form factor. it is simplicity in a very functional package that is easy to use, looks tremendously expensive, yet easy on the pocketbook.     Motorola has outdone itself with this cellphone with its SD memory slot, 1.3 Megapixal/8x zoom camera system, MP3 player and video movie system built into it.     In my line of work with construction, the phone is easy to use via it&apos;s built in bluetooth connection. It&apos;s slim enough to tuck away in a case or place into my pocket and go about my work all day without having to pick it up with work gloves. But best of all...it&apos;s easy to program via the built in settings menu.     For those who are looking for a slim yet sturdy cellphone that is simple to use yet has more features then most people would think of ever using, I suggest giving the new W490 a first, second and even a third look....before buying. Eveytime you look at it, you find something new and exciting about it."	1
"I found out the phone this crook sold me for $40.00 retails for $12.99 at walmart and Best Buy.  Before i left negative feedback i contacted the seller and asked for a $10.00 refund because he totally ripped me off and the seller refused, then said i couldnt leave negative feedback because i threatened him by asking for a refund.

"I got a defective product unlike what I ordered. after back to Samsung technical support they told me the black dots in LCD screen it is not normal and 80% the LCD not original and asked to open it to check about LCD and make sure but I refused it. The seller responded was will file a claim with USPS. and after two weeks of waiting to inform me about any update, there was no any response. so I realize the reply just to finished return period time.  But I seem like I was A fool from the beginning for waiting and think the black dots are normal, but they not respect the customer they stealing my money and sale me defect product and refused to any claim or return it also waste clearance and custom&VAT for defect mobile.

"I got mine for $120 new, at that price point alone and looking at the market, there are not many phones to get, let alone compare to it, spec for spec.  The 3gb of ram and 32gb internal is not seen well into the $200 and above typically, and the camera while not class leading like it could and should have been, produces for me some very satisfying photos that beats ANYTHING in the sub $200 (Minus the Moto G5 Plus Amazon), here is a short run down of this phone:  Screen: I like the 5"" size and the IPS colors on it, really pops out and adequately bright.  Performance: This is no Galaxy S7 but this is snappy for daily tasks and just noticeable in more heavy tasks, I will not call this phone slow.  The 3gb ram ensures most if not all things remain open.  Battery life:  I saw many reviewers talk of ""abyssal"" performance but I can't think but good things about it, I can safely get 4 hours of screen on time under moderate to heavy tasks and if on average use, I can hit two days.  This to me is more than enough.  Camera: The big selling and focus point of this phone, it is no Galaxy S7, or iphone7, but this is still capable of great shots, my experience with video recording has not been too impressive, I say average, but the pictures can turn out good, and with some editing apps like Ado"	1

I contacted him, this is what happened.I did give a good review for how quickly I recieved, he didn&apos;t state he was leaving the country or I might not have bought it.I feel I am entitled to a full refund.    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  From: vickinilla  To: ostriker22  Subject: vickinilla hat eine Frage zu Artikelnummer 120570275465, die am 18.05.10 18:07:47 MESZ endete, gesendet ?

I&apos;m sorry to hear that the phone quit   working. Did you try to take the battery out and   put it in again? The phone did perfectly work   before I sent it to you (I often used it as an   alarm clock). I&apos;m afraid I can&apos;t offer you an   exchange. According to the description I sold the   phone &quot;as is - no returns&quot;. I did so because I   left the US to my home country after the sale.   Even if I would still be in the US I could not   offer an exchange. This was a private sale. I only   had this one phone to sell. I&apos;m sorry I can&apos;t   really help you with this.

I got the phone it worked for a day and when I took it to a sprint store they said that is was broken cause it would not charge and it would cost too much to fix.	0
I got the phone like some day before x-mas.I liked it but its to small for me to keep up wit becuz i stay loosin my phone now. If i lost it i would be mad bout it so i wanted to send it back.Why i decide to buy it because i thought it was big like a I-phone they why i bu it then i got it n was was little.	0

"I got the phone, but it overheated... So I sent it back to the place hoping that they would send me a new one, but they just gave the money back. Im going on a trip out of county this week and i have no phone now... I dont reccomend these people"	0
I got the two phones pretty fast..but one would not turn on ..it would get to the LG page and freeze..but not go past that and actually power on. The other phone did not have a sim card..so that was a headache trying to get aside from activating my phones. I contacted the seller as soon as the first phone froze up..i waited a few days and they never responded..for the price of the phones..the conditions were pretty bad on both..i wanted to return them and i contacted them a second time...still no response. So now...I'm keeping these pieces of garbage but everyone everyone should know  they don't deserve more business if they cant even respond to a message!.. 	0
i got this as a gift for my brother and he has not put it down since he got it. He absolutly loves it.	1
i got this cheap on line and it worked fine but it looks like crap but I&apos;m OK  about  it worked ya I got my moneys worth on this buy i think.	0
I got this for my grandson and so far it is working very well. 	1
I got this for my wife. It honestly works better than my Samsung S4. This however may have something to do with  the Carrier. I have ATT she has Tracfone/Verizon. The battery lasts at least 50% longer and the single strength is better. Do yourself a favor and get one of these.	1
I got this model for 199 new and it is amazing. The AMOLED screen is the best I have ever seen on a smartphone and is just the right size for my hands. Fast processor makes apps very snappy and the build quality from Motorola is durable as always.	1
I got this phone  a day ago now it hasn't  charged nor turn on !  Don't waste ur money it's hard to open and the charger  doesn't work after  using  a different  charger phone only vibrates and nothing  happens 	0
"I got this phone a few weeks ago after using a blackberry pearl for several months previously, so take everything I say with a grain of salt if you are still used to older phones. However even a lot of older ones work a lot better than the T610. When trying to change from one menu to another the process is oftentimes achingly slow. Taking a picture consists or pressing the photo button at least 2-3 seconds before you actually want it to snap, and holding the whole phone extremly still so that it is just a little blurry instead of totally unrecognizable. The speaker in mine also makes loud buzzing sounds occasionally when against my ear. I love sony phones in general, my favorite phone I ever had was an ericsson, but for this particular one it is time to retire it into a museum, not rely on it in your pocket. . . ."	0
i got this phone and it was activated under another account so i can&apos;t use the phone. i have been trying to get a hold of this girl and finally did she said she would look into things and call me back she still hasnt. i have tried calling her and she doesn&apos;t return my calls or emails. TERRIBLE EXPIERENCE! don&apos;t recomned buying from this seller at all!	0
I got this phone and when I turned it on I had to restore it myself because there was the information from the previous user on it. The phone wouldn&apos;t charge or hold a charge.	0
"I got this phone because I did not have insurance on my phone. This was a better option for me to pay way less than going to the Sprint store and paying a freaking arm and a leg for another phone.  I got the phone and it worked fine for 3 weeks all the way up until now. I can make a call on it, but no one can hear me talking. It was a big waste of money and now I am back in the same situation as I started before. I have to spend out more unnessary money on a phone..."	0
"I got this phone because it is water resistant. The phone works well with one major exception, I can not send or retrieve multimedia messages and there is no US support for the phone. When I try to send or retrieve a multimedia message I get an error message &quot;configuration error&quot;. The message does seem to be recieved by the phone but it will not retrieve it for display. The phone does not send the message at all. The enclosed manual is very brief and is of little value. When I called Samsung I was politely told it was not a US model so support was not available. So, if you want to send and recieve multimedia messages or might want any support this is definitely not the phone to buy."	0
"I got this phone even earlier that I expected it. It functions perfectly so far.   It runs very fast. It has the 4.1 android version And I am thinkng on keeping it beacuse is very fast, no lagg, functions perfectly.  Good decent camera for this price, good speakers sound. RAM and processor make it go fast. Good price for this hardware  I must say I had a little problem with the charger, so the seller agreed to send me a replace. Well, now this is not a major problem beacuse I can use other chargers from other smartphones and they go perfectly. "	1
I got this phone for a parent who was not comfortable with a smart phone   they are very happy with it	1
I got this phone for my Mother so she could see the big numbers and it works great. Also the Emergency alerts work great.	1
"i got this phone for my niece for her b-day,and she loved it the first week she had it,but after that the phone started acting up.she now cant bluetooth,or use her multi-media,this has broken her heart,and mine to.LG is a great brand when it comes to home entertainment,but when it comes to mobile phones they aren&apos;t.i think i&apos;m just going to just stick with their tv&apos;s for now."	0

"I got this phone In june of 2009. I really loved it and babied it, If i could have protected everything on it with a cover I would. I had a full body screen protector on it and never dropped it a lot of times, I only remember like 2 times. It was running low on battery one day and then just shut off and i tried to get it to power back on, but the  music buttons were all that lit up. I COULDNT get the keys over to the number-style and i couldnt get it on. The battery worked, it was tested in another friends E8 and then his battery but into my phone, and my phone still didnt turn on. Don&apos;t know about what happened to the phone, but did anybody else have this problem?"	0
"i GOT THIS PHONE INITIALLY ONLY NEEDED A PHONe, decided that I would keep because ot many people had pictures messages on their phones, so I kept my phone. It shut off like 544090440 times bfore i took it to verizon and exchanged it. i strongky dont recommend the c343"	0
i got this phone on the 15th of july and it started acting funny now all it has is is a grey and black screen that says updating but sat like that for a couple days it did this on the 6th of august	0
"I got this phone to replace my LG G4 that started shutting down for no reason.  The LG K20 has a lot of great features and is moderately priced.  I'm very happy with it. The battery seems to last forever, even though I use the phone a great deal throughout the day.  The I'm online and screen is lit for long hours yet the phone never needs a charge until I get home at night."	1
"I got this phone two years ago (2009) after my old phone was stolen.  I still have it, and it still works great!  I&apos;ve never really had any problems with it at all.    It&apos;s perfect for texting, especially if you know how to use 9Word.  It also has access to the web, and I&apos;ve found it very handy with Facebook.  I could even access non-traditional websites.  But no internet plan is required for it.  I love the size and shape of it, it&apos;s perfect for even a woman&apos;s pocket or purse, and sturdy to hold onto.  And although a standard flip phone, the glossy screen on the front helps it look a little more hi-tech.    It holds a lot of photos, whether they were taken by the phone itself or sent from someone else via pix message.  I can also download my own ringtones, whether right from the network or from a computer.  Calls are very clear and strong.  I&apos;ve also used it many times as an alarm clock, and that works great.  It gives the option to download other programs and games, I just never did.    If I had to gripe, I wish it had a higher quality camera.  Though I did take some very nice pictures with it, if the lighting and angle weren&apos;t just right, the photos come out grainy.  I also wish it had more memory, especially while browsing the web.  If a website had too many pictures, it would cause the browser to crash.    But it&apos;s been such a great little phone the last few years.  Unfortunately over the years it&apos;s gotten dinged up and even the camera lens got scratched.  Time for a new one.  But I&apos;m going to miss this one!  It&apos;s been with me through thick and thin, and it&apos;s like saying good bye to a friend."	1
I got this phone very quickly and was very happy with the condition it was perfect with no scratches and everything works perfect on it. 	1
I got this phone yesterday and I was pretty happy with it until I realized today that its not allowing me to make phone calls/receive them and the notifications sounds dont work. Ive tried everything. Im very upset and disappointed with this so far	0
"I got thjis phone in 2003 as a really, really, really big phone event. I think this was the droid of the 2003 era. Verizon&apos;s  FIRST camera phone- and it was a big wow back then. I got it wet 4 or 5 times and it continued to work as it should have and i really really really enjoyed it. I got the a670 i think as my next phone and let me tell you it was nothing but a let down of a phone. so let me just say go get this. it will be a good phone if you still like those old phones."	1
I got tricked thinking I was buying a phone and I receive was a screen with no box attached to out literally a piece of s*@! From this seller do not ever buy from this seller	0

I guess I will work just can't get it to hold charge over 15 or 20 minutes can't even get contacts on it before it goes dead but they never said it would hold charge it the ad never thought to ask like. Can't get a small me cad cause it won't hold charge for me to go get one 	0
"I guess its not totally fair to bash on this product since it was my first ebay purchase. i did not realize there was a sellers description downpage that stated this was not a working phone. other nonworking or part phones i looked at stated so in product view description. After further review i realized what i purchased. item came with a charger that i was able to use for my other phones, not a total loss but lesson learned"	0
I had 5c I loved but froze and purchased this. I love fingerprint I.d to log on and for purchases. Small phone great  ease of use. Apps easy to install and use. Compact not to large and fits in pocket. Straighttalk has best service I tried them all it has never let me down. There are a few places such as basements and riding IN mountains you don't have service. But I get service riding all highways most back roads and I can't express how much I love straight talk. I use a lot of work do hot spots to save on my data usage as I only have the up to 2g plan at the moment. Unlimited talk text and 2g of data. When I purchased my 5c last year I paid $600 for it so to upgrade to 5s for a lot less what a deal. I love iPhones and prefer them to android . 	1
"I had a Blackjack II on my AT&amp;T service some time ago and then switched to another phone.  Since I have had several other phones.  None of the newer ones ever made me as satisfied as the Blackjack II.  I like that is a Windows Mobile based OS which has all kinds of game simulators, extra apps, open architecture, unlike phones with their own software system.  It looks great, I can make my own ringtones from my favorite songs to put on it, change the background wallpaper easily, and it fits in my pocket better because it&apos;s not to think.  It&apos;s also easy for me to text on.  I love it!!  And now that they are not the latest PDA phone, they are inexpensive to buy on eBay.  Yeaaaahhh!!!"	1
I had a few issues with the charger and they IMMEDIATELY addressed them! You can definitely be confident in your purchases with them! Wonderful and caring customer service. All around a GREAT experience!	1
I had a galaxy s6 s7 and s8 active the battery is not comparable to my previous phones 	0
"I had a great experience with this seller. Great product, great value, and just an excellent experience. Thanks again!"	1
"I had a new one and everything was fine, except battery life.  Even without calling, battery lasted 2 to 3 days max.  I ended up dumping it (literally) and getting a new one.  Now I find out that I could have sold it in ebay!"	0
"I had a One M9 and ""upgraded"" to a 10. HUGE mistake. The One M9 has SO much better sound. The 9 has matching speakers at the top and bottom of the screen that face FORWARD. When you turn the phone sideways to watch videos, you get true stereo and much better bass response. The stereo effect is quite noticeable. The 9 sounds simply amazing for a phone. The 10 is as average sounding as any ordinary phone. The 9 also has an IR port. The 10 loses the great sound and the IR Port. I used the IR port constantly as I use the phone as a universal remote for the entertainment center and every tv in the house. I gave the 10 to my son and ordered a good used 9 off of ebay. Much happier with the 9!"	1
I had a phone just like this for years and the hinge broke. I liked it so well I purchased this one to replace it with. I just want a telephone.	1
I had a problem with item purchased...seller went out of his/her way to make me happy...and they did. Can't say enough good things.	1
I HAD A SAME MOBILE PHONE BUT I LOST IT SO I BOUGHT THE SAME ONE.  IT IS A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO USE IT BUT I JUST LOVE IT	1
"I had a sidekick II before and they are awesome phones ,however this seller sold me a phone that wouldn&apos;t power on,I like sidekick because there is no limit as to what you can do with a sidekick,I purchased this one because my sidekick had water damage"	1
"I had a sony Xperia zultra that I broke while loading furniture that worked great for years, so I decided to replace it with the same model. But this one was no where near as good android did not go higher than 4.4 my old one was 5.,1.1, the battery on this one didn't last half as long as my old one did,  looks almost like these units are factory  rejects.

"I had a Torch before, but it got stolen...so I got a new one. This one is amazing. It came with no scratches and was actually brand new! It works perfectly and when I ordered it, I got it in the mail in 2 days."	1
"I had already purchased the Palm Pixi before and unfortunately the screen randomly cracked, I say randomly because it did not fall at all, it was on top of my desk and when I turned to look at it, it had a crack coming from the side of the screen, I was reading up on it and apparently (from what I read) the &quot;random&quot; crack may be caused when the charger is plugged into it...but I love the phone so much, so just decided to buy it again and this time get a dock charger...I got the phone and it was new just like the description read.  Great purchase option!"	1
"I had an iPhone 5, but this one is soo much better in every way.  I like all of ways it does things better and has a long lasting battery in compare to the other.  I would recommend it to others and to you for good quality and fast service."	1
I had an issue with the first phone that i got the slider was in really rough shape on verge of breaking and i contacted the seller and shipped back the first one and got a second one in just a few days that has no issues what so ever.  perfectly fine.	1
"I had an LG G2 that I loved, but it has started to malfunction and the battery life is shorter than it used to be.  I decided to go with the G4 after my son got one and is happy with it.  The operation is very similar to what I am used to, so no learning curve.  The battery life is great and it is replaceable in this one, which is an improvement over the G2.  The phone I received appears to be new and worked instantly when I moved my sim card from the old phone to this one.  Since this is not the latest iteration of the flagship LG phone, I got it much reduced in price than a latest and greatest phone would have been.  I is plenty fast and does everything I need it to do.  I am, so far, totally satisfied with this purchase."	1
"I had an S4 that I really liked...for about a year. It started giving me a lot of problems so I decided to get myself an upgrade. The S7 is everything I expected and more. I've only been using it for about three days at this point, but I am in love with it. Everything has been easy to set up and customize to my liking. The finger print unlock option is an unnecessary perk that amazes me every time I use it. The responsiveness of the screen is really what sells it though; it doesn't have the lag time that the S4 did. Waiting for the other shoe to drop, but so far I love it."	1
"I had been wanting this phone for about a year now, and it&apos;s always been $800 or more on other sites. I just consider myself lucky that I came across this excellent seller who was offering it for almost half the price. What made me finally decide on this specific seller was their past history of excellence, and other people&apos;s satisfied reviews. I am extremely happy with my purchase. I even got it in a cool red color instead of the standard brown with 4 free gifts no doubt!!! How awesome is that. Where else can you get a cell phone, a memory card reader, a screen protector, a leather nokia carrying case, and an actual car charger. These are usual all items the sales associate is trying to upsell when you purchase a new cell phone. I will be buying all my unlocked cell phone from this seller from now on. Don&apos;t hesitate to purchase from this seller. They are prompt, courteous, and deliver on there promises. 5 stars ***** all the way!!!"	1
"i had bought many times and every things it&apos;s okay, but my 2 last bought i don&apos;t recived the items, maybe the sellers are from china, i don&apos;t know what happen, i paid with paypal and never seen my money back, what can i do about this?"	0
"I had bought this phone thru Ebay and the unit was defective, i try to contact the seller to try to get a return approval but he has never answer my e-mails. I&apos;m considering not to buy any more items like this thru Ebay due to a very poor response from the seller&apos;s."	0
i had bougt one from this seller so i dont need this from this seller thanks. so the phone is nice but i have one.	1
"I had envied Smartphones that seem to be ubiquitous these days, but didn't want to be harnessed to monthly contracts - so I did my homework.  I checked to see if there was an Android type of Smartphone that would have similar capabilities to the iPhones (but without the price-tag and the expensive contracts).  I also wanted to be able to transfer my phone number and my prepaid Tracfone minutes to the Smartphone.  I did some extensive homework and found the 'Ultimate 2 LG L41C' on eBay - with 1200 triple minutes as part of the purchase - PLUS with triple minutes FOR LIFE on Tracfone minute purchases.  And NO monthly contracts!  Not only do I love this Smartphone but after three weeks my wife said she wanted one too.  She just returned from a short trip with dozens of pix - synced it to her laptop and all her photos transferred in minutes.  We call friends all over the country and can call to some other countries (without roaming charges). We LOVE our Ultimate 2 LG L41C Smartphones!!!  Bill"	1
I had get my girlfriend one lol 	1
"I had HTC Touch Pro with Windows Mobile 6 before so it was like a quantum leap to another era. I am amazed of in how such short time, phones can develop in such a fast pace. Even though I liked my previous tiny &quot;fatso&quot; alot, the HTC I had before had serious overheating issues, with WiFi on it lasted about an hour, GPS signals were a headache and screen sensitivity was not even comparable.  The new G2 (or Vision/Desire Z) impressed me from the start. I had never used Android system before but within days I had all set up I needed. For travelling Google maps is a joke for a mobile person in Europe unless you want some huge phone bills so I use Sygic. I get a fix in seconds, see the direction I am facing and finding places is so easy. For sports I have Runkeeper and love how the phone now is my everyday companion in tracking my speed and results and does not run out of juice or into problems while doing so. To make the battery last though I had to tinker the processor to run in low speed while screen is off, so it does help alot. All depends of how much you use the phone, it can last in my case for days if I only use it for calling. Once you start surfing heavily or playing, the stock battery wont last till the end of day. For those who wish more battery life, there are Mugen batteries with same size as stock batteries but give you an amazing battery life boost (1800mAh compared to stock 1300mAh).   It is a bit heavy though I have to admit, but qwerty keyboard is a must for me and a compromise I am willing to accept. Since I use Nordic letters alot, by long pressing a key you get the extra key options by default, so there was no worries I actually purchased this one made for the US market.  The screen sensitivity is excellent, have had no issues with reception so far in Europe also and got my 2G/3G also configured fine in Belgium. So all in all, very pleased with my new tiny amusement centre."	1
I had looked at phones at the Verizon store and decided this was to be my new phone.  When I found this one it was at a reasonable price and the service by seller was excellant.	1
"I had my choice narrowed down to 4 phones all were basically the same price and I had eliminated every phone that was not listed as &quot;NEW&quot;.  I choose buying this phone from Tejara Group because they had the most extras for the same price.  When I received the phone it had someone elses wallpaper, several hundred phone numbers and it was quite obvious this phone was not &quot;NEW&quot; like it&apos;s description had stated.  When I emailed them back they stated that it clearly stated the phone was &quot;Like New&quot;.  To which I replied with a copy / pasted screen clearly showing that the phone stated and still states that the phone is &quot;NEW&quot;.  I decided that I would at least try the phone.  I used it for a few weeks only to discover a few more problems.  The back cover (battery cover) would routinely fall off, the bluetooth feature did not work very well and the Wallet was locked and I had no way of getting the passcode to get into it.  All in all I said this is enough and contacted the merchant to return the phone.  I returned it over a week ago and I still have not received my credit.    So if the question was if I would ever buy from this merchant again the answer would clearly be no, not even if he was selling everything at half price."	0
"I had never purchased a phone off ebay and I was a bit skeptical, but I thought, it's only $25. I was very pleased. The phone was ready to go and with a call to Page Plus and ten minutes later, I was back in business. I've been using my new phone for a couple of weeks and it's great!"	1
I had no idea it would not run previous windows pc software.  All previous software is useless.  Why would they design a system that&apos;s not comparable.  Very limited on software	0
I had nothing but problems with this phone went back to my old phone. It kept locking up on me when I tried to use the messages.	0
I had one but had to get rid of it because the buttons were to sensitive on this phone I was texting someone and all the sudden it took me some where else. It's a good phone only for those who like sensitive buttons..The battery last but the buttons are the issue on these phones.	0
"I had one like this and the lcd screen broke .  Instead of buying a new lcd screen i decided to bye a fault phone so that i would use the housing also , the plastics of mine weren&apos;t in the best shape.  I disassemble it when it arrived and use the most parts of it.  To my surprise the phone was in even better condition than the seller describe it.  I must send to the seller a big thank you for the honesty and the superfast shipping of it .  He showed a very profetional behaviour , asking me if it arrived and givin me the tracking numbers for the post office.  Thanks again ."	1
"I had one of these phones first time around in 2003. This apparently new phone is not made to same build quality, More than dissapointed with sharp edges etc. in materials."	0
I had one so I bought another as a gift for my husband. It works great! Functions as needed. 	1
"I had ordered this phone for my husband because he didn&apos;t like the iphone 5s I bought him. Now he hates this phone because apparently it isn&apos;t a NEW phone, it has some sort of virus and will not let him view vidoes. I guess you get what you pay for!"	0
"I had perfect iPhone 6s+. I loved the phone. After Apple screwed up with the update, the phone stopped working. It was frozen all the time, I had to re-boot it constantly, ring tones didn't work. They made me buy a new battery, after they installed it, I could't hear anyone. I decided to get a new iPhoneX. I hate the phone. Extremely inconvinuent to use. Face recognition most of the time doesn't work (if you have glasses on, sunglasses, if light is not perfect). So you constantly need to enter 6 digits password. The most annoying thing it doesnt hold the charge. I need to charge it 3 times a day. Do yourself a favor and  buy 8S instead."	0
"I had problems with this phone mostly due to software issues and updates that either have not or could not have been considered, When I Contacted the seller they did respond immediatly and tried to help so I have no issues with them I believe they acted n good faith all the way. The phone just turns out to be not a good idea"	1
"I had questions and they got back to me right away, will do buisness with them again for sure. I sent a few messages and they got back to me quickly and were more then willing to make sure I was satisfied with the phone."	1
"I had really wanted a good quality phone that did not require Android or iOS. I am familiar with Sailfish OS and so wanted to get a phone with it and since the ""Jolla"" phone is no longer available I was willing. The phone itself is very disappointing, just totally cheap plastic, I could have lived with that and yet it came programmed with Indian which could not be suppressed AND they claim it is a 4G phone when neither of my carriers  AT&T nor Ultra-Mobile could connect to it. Stay away and wair until there is a descent alternative made for this market."	0
"I had the 60Gb SE and storage topped out so I was thrilled to find a 120Gb SE. People have gone phone crazy spending thousands at store. This phone does everything the newest models do and handles it just fine. Came with a $30 life proof screen protector and a case too, as freebies. Im really happy with my purchase. "	1
"I had the LG Shine first and it worked well.  Just didn&apos;t like the little joystick.  I searched and found this CF360 on Ebay.  Won it for only 40 dollars.  I put my SIM card in it and it was ready to go.  Love it.  The camera has less resolution than the Shine, but I don&apos;t use it much anyway.  A note for those who have trouble removing and inserting the SIM cards...  Use a small piece of Scotch Tape.  Just stick one end to the back of the card and pull it out!  Anyway, I love my CF360.  It gets a better signal than the Shine.  It has buttons instead of that stupid joystick.  It takes the same battery as the Shine, which means I can now have a spare.  It&apos;s slightly smaller than the shine, which is a plus.  Bottom line: Don&apos;t sign any more 2-year contracts.  Just goto Ebay and find the phone you want, put your SIM card in it and go."	1
"I had the phone 3 weeks and the charger port broke. I was very careful with the phone because I know how fragile they can be.  Now I have no phone, and I am out $75 ! Thanks for the crappy product !"	0
I had the phone for like a month and it stop working for some reason I&apos;m so mad I want my money back or a new Phone for free	0
"I had the winning bid and paid for the item.  The seller sent a message stating I was the winning bidder, but he couldn&apos;t sell it for the price I won it at.  What is the point of using E-bay if a seller can just back out of the sale?"	0
I had this model in 2 years. Then the screen froze and the screen turned black. And it did not work anymore.  I got a new used phone through ebay. The same happened after 2 days.	0
"I had this phone already but smashed it in the recliner. Very user friendly for me. I love having a slider,it doesn&apos;t call anyone when I throw it in my purse or in my pockets. Large screen on front to see who&apos;s calling in."	1
"I had this phone before, but in blue. I lost it a week later and it was not insured. I went on ebay to find the phone again and was very happy when I found it and it was half the price I paid for the other one. I watched very closely to see if I was going to get the bid. When to last minutes came down and I beat all the other bids, I was so happy. I am not good at bidding cause if it doesn&apos;t look like I could win I give up. This time I really wanted that phone, so I hung in there. I was really impressed by the short time it took for it to reach my home,also. I glad I remember to check on ebay. It was worth it to me. I also insured it this time, so I don&apos;t run into the same problem again. I will be a returning customer."	1
"I had this phone for 1 year and this is the longest time ever for me to keep a phone. I bought it when it first came out on ebay for about $500 and also purchase the california, Nevada maps for another $50 from Route 66, there are no other choices for the maps. It works great, that&apos;s the reason why I kept it for so long, I normally change my phone every fews months. This is a good choice when you&apos;re planning to buy one, I think there are more options now where you can buy maps, and if you&apos;re ok with the tiny screen."	1
"I had this phone for less than a week and couldn&apos;t keep it.  After only a few installed apps, I got a memory error.  I checked and discovered that the phone only had 100MB of memory and you could not move the pre-installed apps to a SD card, I returned the phone. What good is it when you can&apos;t put anything on it?  Avoid unless you only want your phone to make calls and send texts."	0
"I had this phone in the past, but switched it out for an LG Vu. I decided to go back because the LG Vu is very hard to use as far as messaging. This propel is in even better condition than I expected. It honestly looks like it was never used! Great deal because it came with the mini SD which runs from $10 bucks off the shelf. It was processed and shipped out immediately! I am extremely satisfied with this purchase!!!"	1
I had this phone..the reception was horrible..the battery life was even worse..and the reception was hit or miss...as soon as one was out of range..the call was dropped immediately...and it only seemed to work out in the open...	0
"I had this thing on for like a week, and it fell 6 inches and the glass shattered and pebbled. The whole point of this phone is the gorilla glass and the long battery life. This is extremely poor quality screen."	0
I had to ask for a refund; it arrived defective.	0
I had to call ZTE haven't heard back from them yet. I will not ever buy another ZTE phone again.	0
"I had to enlist the assistance of Ebay & PayPal this situation.  The seller stated that there was a family emergency  that took him out of town.  Seller stated that he would print and mail the item.  Needless to say, he didn't get my $$."	0
I had to pay off prior bill to get it released by ALLTEL. I told them about it but got no response back. Might be a good idea to be more customer friendly.	0

"I had touble getting access to the internet. I called and got that fixed, then I couldn&apos;t receive any multi-media tex messages, then I called and got that fixed, and the last straw was when they told me I wouldn&apos;t probably be able to see my MyFaves on the phone or have access to change them from my handset and also I wouldn&apos;t be able to see music videos on the phone or have access to my TZones for callertunes, wallpapers or ringtones.. I had to return the phone. :/"	0
I had trouble with the phone. You can not use any application nor the play store. It appears to have a bug and take it to a local and he could not fix. This is costing me time and money and for this reason I will have to give a negative evaluation.	0
I had washed my phone and needed a replacement that didnt cost a fortune. I found this one and loved the phone and the price too. I was looking for something that didnt have all the (bells and whistles). I will definately go there again if I need another replacement.	1

"i hate this this phone. shortly after i bought the phone the camera stopped working. i didn&apos;t even get to take 1 pic. then not to long after that, the mic stopped working so i cant talk on it now. the only reason i bought the phone was because i needed something asap since my pantech duo took a crap on me. i am not having any luck with phones. it seems like i am just buying junk."	0
I hated that this phone&apos;s options are so limited. The phone doesn&apos;t like to charge after a while and then the random turn-offs occur. Would not recommend this to a friend because it is extremely unreliable. I only bought it because it was cheap and I needed a way to communicate while the time-being.	0
I have  not receive this product yet. The ETA should be Nov 17.  Can somebody check it and advise the tracking#?	0

I have always liked the flip style phones and when Sprint introduced the Lotus I felt that it would be a really good phone. At the time that I was renewing my contract I did not have the cash to purchase it so had to settle for a different one. I now have one and I am very happy with it	1

"I have always thought that the most important thing in our life is not having the best cell phone but having the most wonderful people to talk to. This SE has become a fundamental part of my daily life because of the following: 1-Never fails. You should never have to turn it off or remove the battery, this phone never gets stuck. 2- It is very practical: for being small fits in my front pocket and I do not fall or forget it ever. 3- It does not give me problems: Although I talk a lot, the battery always reaches. 4- Do what the most expensive cell of all I know: The photos are the best, especially at night. 5- It's very fast, big Memmory! I also think that big screens are not for men, at least for me, because I do not use a wallet and otherwise I would forget or I would fall on occasion. Something very personal: I love the ""low profile"" and with this phone nobody imagines that I walk with the best of technology. I was astounded that in this time when highlights in all ""The Appearance"" of the new products, someone was so smart toinvent this phone. Maybe for others not, but it was what I always looked for and I love to have found it."	1
"i have an elephone from china, with octacore processor, they made improvements on the design but they left the battery dead as it was using it for 30 mins by surfinf and a bit of game and ur Batt is dead for sure, thats why they left the battery life blank lol no specific time coz it wll only last for that time on that usage they even sent me a 3000mah, batt. but its stil the same waste of money nokia 1020 still dominates it."	0
"I have been 3 weeks and still have not recieved my item I bought.  I got an email from the seller with a tracking number on it, and found the UPSP had mis-routed my item. I live in Maine. They sent it to Washington State??? Duh...    Not Happy!"	0
I have been a Palm OS user for many years starting with the Handspring and then a Tungsten E.  I needed a new PDA to maintain all of my calendar and address book databases.  I am using the Centro just as a PDA and not for the phone features.  I am very happy with the ease of use and the ability to use a keyboard instead of just using the Graffiti to enter data into the handheld.  It is also most useful to be able to use the Palm Desktop to easily access my info on my computer.  I highly recommend the Centro	1

"I have been looking for a while for this product, and this seller had the best price and his reviews were good. i would buy more from this seller"	1
"I have been making purchases through NewEgg long before there was an Internet or EBay. I cant believe they would sell such a poor product. It turns on, takes 3 minutes to make contact with WiFi. Loads the camera when you dont want it and cant get out of it. (Requires battery pull to restart) Wont load any app. (Black or white screen) In short, utterly useless as a phone, camera, email device or anything really, as it is too light to make a decent paperweight."	0
"I have been shopping with ebay since 2005. Though I have not bought very many items, I have been very satisfied with the quality of the product and the time of shippment.  On this particular item, Motorola Phone, I had the worst time.  I am in the middle of my contract and it would cost me about $150 for a new phone.  I am not paying that much for a phone when I just want a phone that makes calls, dials calls, and send and receives text messages.  I am not a person who has to have the latest, i.e. the IPhone. I decided to check ebay for any used phones that would work at least until the time to renew my contract, since my drown. This one was perfect.  Low price, headset (which I don&apos;t use), home charger and car charger and clip.  After 2 weeks of a promised 5 day delivery it was in good condition and the chargers worked.  Great - took a while but worth it.  I charged it that night and began using it the next day.  I call my husband when I go to work and speak to him for about 10 minutes.  During this conversation the phone died.  I have to go on line and spend an extra $6.00 to get a battery. I am awaiting the battery now to see if that is the problem or if its the phone itself.  This has been the worst purchase ever."	0
"I have been trying to configure to a ""Samsung 6 Galaxy"", via Wi-Fi I don't think there is any fault with the unit. Is it me? I have been reading the manual, watching tutorials, but to no avail. Very disappointing configuration is not a bit more simple."	0
"I have been using a Razr cell phone for a long time.  It&apos;s easy, fast and familiar!  When my cell phone broke I immediately got on ebay knowing I could find one and I did.  The price was right and it was shipped fast.  I was back in the groove in no time!  Thank you ebay!"	1
"I have been using Blackberry phones for many years and this is the best one for these reasons:    * Does its core jobs competently for business and private use.  Phone, speakerphone, good wireless reception, excellent email handling, usable keyboard, usable camera, everything works well without overdoing anything.    * Has a trackpad instead of a trackball.   The trackpad is like an optical mouse turned upside down. It is a big improvement over the unreliable trackball on some models.    * Can be customised  You can hide all the icons for things that you don&apos;t use, so you get a nice clean uncluttered display that only does what you need.    * Connects to WiFi  Using WiFi to make calls works great and saves roaming charges abroad.    * Has voice control  This has been popular in Europe for years, why it&apos;s taken so long to get it in a Blackberry is beyond me.  Say &quot;Call Home&quot; and it just does it."	1
I have been using product a couple of months. Face feels smooth & I believe it's getting firmer. I have bought several bottles since e-bay's prices are so good. Sellers ship very quickly & securely.	1
I have been using the Motorola Razar and all the others as the have been up graded and this is the best one yet.	1
"I have been using this phone now for about a month and a half, so far I have had no problems, the phone itself is flawless. The service on the other hand works best in more populated areas, cities etc. Not so good in rural areas. But if you live in an area with good reception you will see no flaws, after all I am writing this review with this phone."	1
"I have been waiting for a ""smart"" trac fone that I could use in areas where I travel to, this fit's the bill. So far, I am loving this phone. It's easy to find your way around and customize the screen for icons you use frequently. It's taking me a bit to get  used to the touch screen keyboard, my old phone had an actual keyboard. But I think that's a normal learning curve. The battery seems to last a healthy amount of time. I am not a heavy user, but I find I use this one more often that the older phone, probably because the screen is bigger and easier to read. I would recommend this phone.  "	1
I have bought and sold on E Bay through the years. I received this phone it would not work. I sent it back the same day that I received it. I paid the postage as the man told me to do. I finally reported it to Pay Pal giving them the tracking number. It is still not settled.  	0
"I have bought several of these iPhone 4 for when I travel internationally and this one is by far the worse of the bunch. While the description say it has some scratches, the screen was COMPLETELY scratched to the point that even at max illumination you can notice them, the case was dirty like a mechanic who was under a car just hand you this phone (it actually has grim and some sort of grease) the mute button is ""flimsy"" at best. Fork another 10 buck and buy a refurbish one from any one else , you be happier and perhaps get a much better product. I attempted to fix it by placing a brand new bullet proof screen guard and still looks horrible (see the pic, which doesn't make the phone full Justice)"	0
"I HAVE BOUGHT THIS IPHONE, WHICH THE SELLER SOLD ME AS UNLOCKED BUT IT WAS NOT UNLOCKED. I PAID $370.00 FOR THIS PHONE. SELLER LIED ABOUT THIS PRODUCT.HE TOLD THIS WAS LIKE NEW ITEM BUT THIS PHONE HAD CRACK ON THE BOTTOM OF THIS PHONE. PLEASE BE CAREFUL BEFORE BUYING ANYTHING FROM THIS SELLER."	0
"I have bought this phone twice before. No it doesn&apos;t break I just tend to drop it in water. I like this phone because it&apos;s stylish, easy to use, and has all the functions that I need without a touch screen. Can&apos;t stand the touch screens."	1
I have bought two phones here and they were both faulty. The seller decide that it was not his/her job and refused to refund money!  Shame!	0

"I have for some time being looking for a Nokia 6280;but noticed that several on EBAY suffered from Software problems.This in it&apos;s self must be rare for a Nokia.However;I did noticed that someone was selling a Nokia 6288 which stated that it was the improved version of the Nokia 6280 which had alot of Software problems.I purchased one of these on Ebay recently secondhand and are really impressed with the quality of the 2 mega pix Camera and the easy of use of the whole mobile.Once again the quality of this Nokia 6288 is up to the usual Nokia High Standards.I really like it and although it is not unusual like my previous Nokia&apos;s like the 7600,the 6260 or the Nokia 3650 it is a GREAT MOBILE.So to Sum Up the Nokia 6288.If you our looking for a Great Mobile that will do most of the things that you need today without any major software problems that seem to effect the odd Nokia 6280 then go for the Nokia 6288.Yes there are fewer of them for sale on Ebay at the moment and I do not know if that will continue to be so;but consider one.It is an EXTREMELY GOOD NOKIA MOBILE.Well Done to Nokia once again.As they say Connecting People To People."	1
"I have found the Iphone 4s easy to use. Interesting learning about Iphone compared to aneroid. If you have an issue, etc Apple has such a good team of advisors that are willing without question to help you out. This alone has sold me on apple products. Hope they never change."	1

"I have got this phone imm without any delay. thanks to the sender for prompt shipping. Still i hvnt use it, I have bought this for my brother."	1
"I have had 2 of these phones and they have both cracked in the same places. Both of the phones I had have lasted me about 6 months each. They are too top heavy!!! Another thing...the battery cover always falls off and the attenna gets loose. I have several friends with the same phone and they have or had the same problems with it.  I love Nokia phones, but I would not recommend this phone to anyone."	0
I have had a great experience with the phone i bought. The experience with the seller was great too they where fast and very helpful.	1
"I have had a Motorola V60 phone for many years without a single problem.   I like it because it is simple to use and has hld up very well, requiring no service at all."	1
"i have had about 2 blackberrys in my time, and none can compare to my HTC 8525.  Its everthing i want in a business phone!"	1
"I have had every phone, Blackberry, Palm, and Android.  Let me tell you there is NOTHING better than the Iphone.  This is the seventh one I have bought for my family.  Try it, you&apos;ll love it."	1
"I HAVE HAD MY GZONE FOR OVER A YEAR NOW, AND WITHOUT A DOUBT, IT IS THE BEST PHONE I HAVE EVER OWNED. IT IS VERY VERY RUGGED. I DROPPED IT INTO THE TOILET AND IT DIDNT BOTHER IT A BIT. I HAVE DROPPED IT FROM 7 FEET IN THE AIR, IT JUST BOUNCES. THE VZ NAVIGATOR IS FANTASTIC. I RECCOMEND THIS PHONE FOR ANY GUY WHO WANTS OR NEEDS A GOOD SIZE, HE MAN PHONE."	1
"I have had my Nuron for about 2 weeks and I LOVE it. It may not be that new anymore with all the android phones flooding the market but Nokia offers the OVI store, which has games and applications very similar to the Android or Iphone market. Phone comes standard with FREE maps, which do not use data unless you pull up information. I would recommend this phone to anyone that wants the features of a smart phone without the smart phone price."	1
"I have had my sanyo phone for about six years. I love the phone it has nice size dialing numbers and display numbers. For me it is very user friendly. And meets my needs.When it accidentally got wet,I was worried I wouldn&apos;t be able to find another one.If some thing should ever happen to this one I hope I will still be able to find another one."	1
"I have had no trouble with this phone. I bought it so I could check my stocks, and the Openwave internet device on my phone works very well.  I like the voice calling feature, I almost always use it when calling.  I have over two hundred names in my phonebook.  The only thing that I had trouble with was transferring my Outlook contacts by cable using Motorola Phone Tools.  I bought the cable on Ebay, and it might be counterfeit.  I had no trouble transferring by using my bluetooth dongle. I haven&apos;t used the music player very often, but it does work very well."	1
I have had several cases from the Otter to aluminum bolt on cases. None have protected as well as this case and none looked as stylish or felt so slim and light!! A purchase I can brag about!	1
"I have had several types of Motorola phones through the years &amp; with various carriers. I have also had other brands, but when my phone was dying of old age I decided I wanted to go back to Motorola. I went to ebay for 2 reasons, did not want to be under a new contract &amp; because AT&amp;T does not carry the Motorola RAZR I like. I am not into the so called smartphones. Won&apos;t use all the features &amp; don&apos;t want to pay for them! The RAZR V3xx is a nice easy to use but reliable phone. Has good clear sound, can&apos;t complain about the picutes I&apos;ve taken. I made sure my phone was a new one &amp; from the US. I have no complaints and have had the phone several months. I would buy again and deffiantly recommend to anyone."	1
I have had the phone for a couple of months now and it has been great!  This is my first &quot;Smart&quot; phone so I don&apos;t have a lot to compare it to but I have no complaints.  Put a 32gb micro SD card in and the music player work good.  Dealer and shipping was A plus!	1
"I have had this exact phone for two years and was very familiar with it, when It went bellyup I went back to Verision but they didnt have this phone available anymore and all they were interested in was signing me to a new contract with a new phone that I would have to learn to operate all over again.       So I jumped on E-bay and found the same phone listed there at a fair price and lived happily everafter. price was fair, shipping was fair and the only thing not so fair was having to wait for it to arive. Thank you E-bay"	1
I have had this model phone in the past and it preformed proficiently. My dad was in need of a phone and being technically inclined he asked me to find him one. Since receiving the phone we have had multiple problems out of it. Its a piece of junk. 	0
I have had this phone for 3 years dropped it too many times it finally broke to where it needed to be replaced.  Nothing else on the market new even compared so I paid same amount I originally paid when it was new to get another new one!	1
I have had this phone for a few days but it's working great for me and i believe its worth the cost.	1
"I have had this phone for about a good month or so now, so far. I believe Samsung has far under-done themselves and I am thoroughly unenthused towards this product. It&apos;s slow. It crashes when used too far. It also turns itself off and resets itself when it sees fit. If you are looking to get this for someone you hate, then by all means, buy this product.    - From a disgruntled IT proffessional"	0
"I have had this phone for exactly 1 month and a day, so far this phone has been so difficult the storage is so low no matter what you do you cant have any apps barely, it just keeps telling me insufficient storage space. this phone is not what i thought it was going to be i like the look and everything but the main problems with the phone."	0
"I have had this phone in the past! This model was very well made.The LG 290CM was one of the best phones made hands down! I love everything about this phone. I have tried the android phones and the battery life on these phones are terrible! I , also, lost many calls and did not receive some of my messages until the following day!! I will keep my LG290CM any day over the competitors!"	1
"I have had this phone since our last Verizon contract signing.  This was almost 2 years.  It has repeatedly broken.  The only saving grace was I had it under warranty.  In two years I have had 6 phone replacements, all the same model, all were poor.  The reception can be unreliable, the phone can freeze up on you and the only way to fix it is to remove the battery and pray it reboots.  I will say the reception improved when I bought an extended life battery (cost me $60).  If you get this phone, get it a good case and cross your fingers.  If you get it under contract, make sure it is insured."	0

I have just received the phone and I love the sleekness and style.  The phone is very classy.  It sounds very crisp when you make a call.  This phone has an ease of use to it.  I highly recommend this phone.  I replaced my Juke with this and I have no regrets.	1

"I have never understood the attraction of iphones, they have a tiny screen, and from what I've seen from tons of users, the batteries suck, the the screens shatter easily.  The Z30 is none of that. Large, clear screen, tough, reliable, a solid two days of battery life, wireless charging, Android apps.....whats not to love?  I do Construction, and my phone gets dropped, tossed, dirty, never fails, never drops calls, has great features...I cant imagine wanting a different phone."	1

I have not gotten my phone. I saw the sellers address and phone number so I saw I could send him a check. I did and the lies began. First he said he sent the phone. I waited. Then he said I went I vacation so I must have missed it. Then he said he sent another one and it would be there. It never came. Then he said he sent another one and gave me an outlandish tracking number. He told his grandmother my check bounced and she screamed at me and yet he kept making excuses to me. What do I do now?	0

I have nothing positive to say about this phone. I&apos;m not even sure why it&apos;s considered a &quot;smart phone&quot;. It won&apos;t run half the apps I want it to. Piece of crap. I wouldn&apos;t pay $10 for a new one.	0
"I have one and I hate it!!! You must have a wireless carrier but you are restricted in choice. Now the unwanted unusable used phone is worthless to sell. As far as using this phone, it&apos;s impossible to learn how.  I spent hours with &quot;Support&quot; and learned nothing about how to use this phone. The phone&apos;s so-called User Manual is pure useless trash. The battery runs down in one day even without use so you constantly have to charge it. I also learn that Sprint &quot;locks&quot; this phone so I can&apos;t use it with any other carrier found to be more efficient and competitive - STAY AWAY FROM SPRINT phone products - definitely not user friendly, reliable, or competitive! It&apos;s also made in China!"	0
I have one.  Nice phone BUT not supported by Microsoft.  Still no all important 8.1 update.  If you want a Windows 8 phone buy a Nokia which is supported and upgraded.	0
"I have ordered an iPhone 6 Plus, and waited a while for it to arrive, when it finally arrived I was all excited, but when it came to opening it there were just 6 small packs of skittles in it and no iPhone. When I contacted the seller they wanted me to return candies back to them and then I would get my refund back. And so I did send the candies back and it's been a month already and still didn't get my refund yet, which cost me a lot of money. Now I can't even get a hold of the seller. Do not buy from this seller"	0

"I have owned a nokia 6085 phone prior to buying my replacement for over three years with no problems. The old one still works great and I am glad it does. This new phone will not hold the date and time when powering on and off. When I was carrying the new phone in my pocket and I leaned over to pick um my dogs toy, the tones sounded and when I pulled it out of my pocket the display was bright backlit with no lcd display. I powered it down, removed the battery and sim card. No luck, the display still don&apos;t work. I have only owned this new replacement phone for a couple of weeks. It must have been a refurbished phone and now it needs refurbished again in the trash can.  I will re-activate the old phone and keep this malfunctioning one for a stand by. I only wasted $90 on this refurbished junk."	0
I have owned many cellphones and the ZTE Axon7 is the best.   Holy recommend 	1
"I have owned one of these phones for the past 18 months. It was provided free with the contract of our local 3G network, Melita, here in Malta. I found it really ideal in every way, the display, the camera, the functions of the phone (you can even manage your email with it), the size - light and compact. Then I found out that Nokia are not producing this particular phone any longer... So I looked for, and bought, the last remaining two unlocked ones that were available on ebay. In fact, there is not much point in doing this review really, as the phone is no longer being produced. It is always the way - the minute you discover a good thing that you really like, it goes out of production! Maybe somebody at Nokia might read this, and think about putting it back into production again..."	1

"I have purchased this phone to be a present. So I would like it to be as good as original phones which were made several years ago.  This phone is built very well, but not absolutely perfect.  The plastic on the back side and on the back cover has a hardly noticable difference in finishing coating. The metal stripe around the phone has a hardly noticable difference in glare when it is being moved back and force. The package was not in good condition - inner parts were disordered. All other things of the phone itself (keyboard, latches ets.) looks quite solid and good.  Quality of voice during a call is good - just clear sound.  In overall - I like the item."	1
"I have rec&apos;d 3 of these phones from T-Mobile in less than 6 weeks. Each one of them I have used for work related issues.  I take pics of defects and send them to my office to review.  All 3 handsets froze up in the process of receiving a pic...or sending a pic. Both the units &amp; batteries, chargers..etc...were all trouble shot &amp; replaced...&amp; still they froze up in the process of using them. T-mobile says it is a known issue but, will not be processed or taken care of right now.  After 3 replacements, they just send you a different phone altogether...samsung...sony ericson...etc....    IF your power starts to mess up... &amp; it shuts down in the process of using texting, recv&apos;ing or sending pics...PLEASE call it in immediately &amp; get it reported &amp; exchanged. Thank you !"	0

"I have received two Ciphone C6 phones from the same vendor and both have been defective. The first one had a defective screen that would not respond to input and the second had an electronic feedback sound at the other end of my call to someone and that was all they could hear. I could hear them fine.    Amazingly enough, others who bought in the same auction are not reporting any problems....that I am aware of. I might add that the auction listing had many questions answered and one claimed the version to be a C6A and both of mine were the older C6T. Apparently the vendor was taking the word of the manufacturer on the version and didn&apos;t know until I inquired about this. So, the other buyers probably didn&apos;t receive the version they were supposed to....beware!    I am currently awaiting my 2nd replacement unit (3rd phone overall) to arrive and asked that it be thoroughly tested before shipment. I have already spent an additional $27 US returning the other two and don&apos;t think return shipping on items returned (sent out) within a week of receiving due to defect should be paid by the buyer....where is the incentive to the seller to make sure they aren&apos;t sending junk and are packaging correctly?    I&apos;m hopeful this 3rd phone will function properly and I can get on with my life.    The phone is a nice sleek package and feature rich for the price......but no feature is useful if it or the platform it is operating upon don&apos;t function properly."	0

Which are none.  This stupid thing TOUCHED the water, and it now will not turn on.  I have (and did so immediately) removed the battery and will wait until the end of tomorrow, 35+ hours, before I test it.  I can not believe this is happening.  I am thoroughly upset.  I am most upset with the seller for selling me a faulty product advertised as new..........."	0

"I have spent countless hours on the phone with Samsung about the issues with this phone. NO, I guess I am not talking about hardware failure or hang-ups.  I am talking about all of the bloatware that Samsung and the carier whom signs it, places on the phone. These applications DRAIN your battery down and there is no way of removing it without ""jail breaking"" a phone. I do NOT chose to jail break a phone because it can cause issues and/or is very risky, but none the less a consumer should NOT have to ""mod"" a product just becaus the factory did a very bad job on it. I emailed Samsung MUTLIPLE times on these issues on needing a patch that would remove such programs, and they did not want to address it. I started noticing problems with these applications draining my battery already and was concerend about not wanting to use the phone. I work out in the middle o' nowhere and I thought to myself what better thing to have than a good phone, but ""good"" is only as ""good"" as the company that made it. I am talking about when a person needs to dial 911. And of course, we were in that spot. Guess what, NO emergency services, because the phone had run itself out of battery. What was the cause of this?? Well none other than ALL of the applications taht would NOT shut off. Even when I told samsu"	0

"I have this phone and the more apps you put on it, the slower it gets.  I even upgraded the 2g mem to 8g and it still freezes up.  You will get a call and it will be locked on the home screen so you can&apos;t see who is calling or it will show the number but not the contact.  The apps are great when they are not freezing up and you have to force close.  I can have 2 apps on it and it is SLOW moving between screens and loading.  I&apos;m not talking about the internet or the service just the phone itself is very slow."	0

Super responsive...outstanding features, and, once you get used to the &quot;touch&quot;it&apos;s a PLEASURE to own. I STRONGLY suggest reading the instruction booklet thoroughly, as there are subtle tricks that make this phone even MORE fun than it would appear!"	1
"I have to tell you about problems this phone had, I dropped it just twice, little carpet drops, no marks, and it wouldn&apos;t turn on only charged. Sent in for an exchange and was sent a new phone back, it shut off repeatedly when receiving text messages. I think it might be unreliable, but if it worked for you that&apos;s a plus."	0
"I have two White phones and one black phone activated and has been an excellent phone from my first black HTC EVO 3D.  I got the first black HTC EVO 3D to replace my Samsung phone.  It had a good look and a balance feel to it.  It really felt good in my hand.  I played and enjoyed the features.  I first noted that it was easy to use, with less button steps to accomplish the same thing with previous phones, like entering numbers to my address book; applying ring tones to incoming numbers; messages from the same originating number were kept together when messages came in; using settings; syncing with WIFI, etc.  I lost my keyboard with this phone but it offers swipe and once used to it (with a stylus), you will stop missing your keyboard.  My Father got the first White phone and was impressed with the phone features, much better than his previous phone.  It has a multiple &quot;home page&quot; feature that you can customize with specific Apps.  These Apps can be grouped together to your heart&apos;s desire, so that no home page will ever look &apos;busy&apos;.  Grouping apps to a particular liking is practical.  One &apos;home page may have a clock, local weather, banking, stocks, music, etc. for when you head out in the morning for errands, or work.  Another may have games, a clock, the alarm, &apos;entertainment apps, etc. for when you&apos;re home, etc.  Touch the home button and it gets you home, touch it again and it displays all 7 &apos;home pages&apos; to choose from.  He was also very impressed with the animated wallpaper that you can program to change every so often.  Our 10 year old granddaughter is an ace at using my phone.  I loan her my phone and she has pictures of our cats as wallpaper; she parks games on one of my home page; she knows my phone.  I have such confidence in these phones that I have one black phone that is not yet activated, ready to replace an older HTC EVO Slide.  When we first moved to Fresno CA, my wife was not familiar with locations of specific places like Chipotle, Jo Ann&apos;s, Pismo&apos;s, Sal&apos;s, the movie theater, etc.  She drives a Lexus RX330 with the Nav System and she uses her HTC EVO 3D Nav System, voice activated. From her experience, her phone was better, reliable.  She just says the name of the place, she then chooses a street and off she goes.  When our youngest son needed a phone, he agreed to take over her phone since he was already familiar with it.  He got that &apos;reliable&apos; phone.  She got herself an HTC EVO 4G LTE.  She said it had a slim, feminine look to it, that was just for her.  Having 4 out of 5 lines in my family says that there must be something that these HTC EVO 3D phones are doing right.  Compare initial cost to the phone quality, durability, and service they give, I believe that these phones are totally misunderstood, under appreciated and totally overlooked.  The HTC EVO 3Ds are the first phones that the battery actually last us a day, from day 1.(we have no car chargers, we have what we use at bedtime).  We have no CONs except that I confess that we do not use the camera 3D feature but we do use the camera.  Overall, I am greatful for my first HTC EVO 3D that continually performs without issues.  It started a trend that my other phones have fallowed.  In my experience, it performs better than others of higher cost and for the price, there really is no comparison to the reliability and durability of this phone to our previous phones.  Can&apos;t go wrong with an HTC EVO 3D."	1
I have Used it for 2 weeks now and dont see problems. Its still a great condition phone. 	1
"I have used the phone and is not in good condition.The phone heats up and the charge only gave me 2.5 hours of talk time. Compared to other used phones, the phone does not compare, very poor. I paid good money, and did not get a phone that should be in god condtion. I will never buy a used phone on e-bay again."	0
I have used this model of phone since it was first released on the market.  It communicates and syncs very well with my computers both running Win XP &amp; Win 7 Active Sync app.  This is the last &quot;smart phone&quot; that Verizon will offer a pay as you go data plan.  This is important to me as I don&apos;t want to pay the outrageous prices for internet capability when I don&apos;t need or use it.  It works great as a PDA / Phone and great for texting.  Finding a replacement on eBay was a great bargain.	1
"I have used this phone for a few years, had to replace a gray version of the same phone. I drop it in acetone, but it still work for about 6 mos. after that. I like it being a flip phone, I feel like the ear and mouth areas are in the right place."	1
"I have wanted one for a while now , I'm loving its features, well with the price "	1
I haven&apos;t contacted the seller so this is premature.  The phone doesn&apos;t accept a charge and it&apos;s frustrating as I&apos;ve had it maybe 2 weeks?  Likely he&apos;ll do wonderful things to make this right and I&apos;ll remove the one star but it&apos;s very close to the 30 days that I can leave feedback and I think it&apos;s my one insurance that I can have this problem solved.	0
I HAVEN&apos;T RECEIVED IT YET!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! PLEASE HELP ME WITH ANY INFORMATION YOU CAN...IT&apos;S BEEN ALMOST A MONTH....I THOUGHT BEING THAT IT WAS AN INTERNATIONAL DELIVERY IT WOULD TAKE LONGER!!	0
"I HAVEN&apos;T USE IT BECAUSE I HAVE NEVER RECEIVED IT,  THE SELLER USED A FALSE TRACKING NUMBER TO DEFRAUD ME,  SELLER DOESN&apos;T ANSEWR MY QUERY,  SELLER IS NOT RESPONSIBLE"	0

I haven't receive this product yet.	0
I haven't received yet.	0
"I haven't used it!!!  I wanted a regular Verizon phone, not one that you buy minutes on.  The seller did not specify the type phone it was on his ad but he did say it was returnable so I ordered it.  When I found out is was not a regular Verizon flip phone I could use with my Verizon account, I asked to return it.  They denied the return.  I have called Ebay 3 times and was told I would be able to return it the first time I called but never got an authorization so I called back.  I was told the next 2 times I could take it up with Pay Pal.  I use a regular charge card, not pay pal. I am about to call my credit card carrier and ask them to stop payment on this to Ebay."	0
I heard it was a good phone but it turned out to be much better. Was worth the $. Sorry I didn't upgrade sooner.	1
I honestly think the I727 is one of the best smartphones out on the market. I  Would recommend this phone to anyone out there. Very satisfied with my purchase.	1
I hope it works fine when I get it 	1
I hope this lady not dishonest. I see she refused to pay for an item she won and lied about why canceled her bid.	0
I hope you can send me a replacement express mail to make up for sending me a broken phone..	0
"I hoped this phone is excellent but windows operating system is not user friendly and difficult to use. Then, camera is no so good. Nokia should use android operating system in future. I won&apos;t buy window phone."	0
"I initially got a defect one, like the wifi did not work at all. Then I requested for an item exchange, and the store reimbursed the shipping fee as well from my place back to the store. The exchanged item works well!"	1
"I initially was disappointed due not fully understanding what I purchased as far as accessories were concerned and the fact that I couldn't set up the device.  I initially left a negative rating.  However, the seller worked with me to quickly find a solution and I am extremely happy with the results."	1
I intend on using this device only as a mp3 player ...it has the wolfson dac look it up very good sounding chip.....the phone compared to say my note 4 or S7 is basically a paper weight it is slow and limited but the sound ......the age old .....they dont make.em like this anymore does apply here 	1
"I jumped at the deal to replace a phone that was going bad and, it was my fault I guess, I did not realize that  would have to pay an additional internet hookup fee that is required. Since this was to replace my old one i &quot;assumed&quot; that I would only have to pay this once. Now I cannot use both phones as they have to be activated. and T-mobile is adamant that if I just give the phone away I am still stuck paying for the two internet fees. The salea person told me a few things but did not tell me about this fact.  Otherwise a great phone is in my posession waiting for my old phone to die again."	0
"I just bought it but compared to LG Optimus GT540 it&apos;s virtually the same except that it&apos;s thinner, lighter , smaller and comes with Android 2.2 Froyo. I think the speaker could have been louder but it&apos;s not too low. Touch screen is very sensitive, almost no need touching, but if you put a protective screen on it you will need to press normally. Response to actions is quite fast considering 600MHz processor. Screen is a good size too. Haven&apos;t watched movies on it yet but messaging is comfortable. If not there&apos;s the voice recognition option or Droid control connection using pc keyboard ! Only thing that bothers me is that you have to press a small button to unlock it and sometimes it&apos;s not that easy to locate. Haven&apos;t got the hang of it yet. Quite annoying. Loads of apps, for whatever you may need. Reception is good . Over all a great mobile."	1
"I just bought this a week ago..and when it was already come to me and i opened the box..i think this is already used,bcs it&apos;s scratch and i knew it, it was not new..and i don&apos;t trust this guy anymore..don&apos;t buy with this guy..u&apos;ll be unsatisfied with his cellphone..if i lie i&apos;ll kill my self.."	0
"I just bought this phone in August and it has quit working already. I am so disgusted. Thought I was getting a great deal on a new phone, but I guess not. Not happy at all!!!! I actually loved the phone when it was working, but did not last long enough for me to give it a good rating. It worked all day and I went to use it and the screen was black. Tried turning it back on, even took battery out and put back in and it just is stuck in a loop staying on the Galaxy S5 start page. Got it here on Ebay, so I guess I am just screwed."	0
I just didnt want to go though the trouble of returning it cause I need to use the EarPods.	0
I just find out GPS on my new Note 4 is not working so don't know what to say about it I had high hopes but now I have to see what can I do about it 	0
I just got the equipment en perfect condition with everything as said. And by the way 2 days before I expected.	1
"I just got the phone today, and the person who sold me this phone did NOT mention that the 7,8,and 9 numbers didnt work at all, and the M,N,B does NOT work either. This is a bad phone. They DID NOT tell me that it was messed up they said it was working great and nothing was wrong with it!!!! bad bad bad phone."	0
"I just joined ebay and wasn&apos;t sure how things would go. But after buying this phone, I am very pleased. This seller made sure they described the condition perfectly and was packaged well. When I recieved the phone, it was perfect. I love this phone now and wish all the luck possible to the seller in future sells."	1
I just love it its want i want and would buy from this seller again. Its much easier for me to use with the keyboard gotta love it and will never have no problems using it great phone and i love all the apps on it.	1
"I just love the blackberry pearl.  The size is just right, the picture quality and the overall features of the phone.  LOVE IT!! LOVE IT!!"	1
I just love the phone. It's the right size and the extra storage space of a 64 gb is a winner. It does so many things and I'm learning how to use all the features. 	1
I just love this phone...its a big upgrade from my little tracphone flip top. Easy to use...nice for for the price and can&apos;t beat triple minutes for life...its a value for anyone seeking a fun phone without the the big price.	1
I just need the screen and battery of that phone. It&apos;s a great deal because original screen and battery cost at least $100 on Amazon. Delivered in two days. Just a little scratch on the screen. Works wonderfully!	1
I just ordered the phone Friday and it's already here!!!!! Trusted seller will order again in the future!!! 	1
"I just ran the IMEI number shown on the box, and it comes back as being questionable. Seems that quite a few devices are being sold as Note 9s and are actually clones or ones that are system locked and aren't the actual device that is being shown.  Be wise and do your homework!  It's your money - and you worked hard for it, don't end up working twice as hard to get it back."	0
"I just received my phone and was able to use the smart switch app to quickly transfer all of my data and settings over in under an hour.  The battery life seems excellent and it has plenty of RAM allowing me to multitask and use multiple map programs while I drive.  So far I am very pleased with this phone, the screen size and its capabilities.  "	1
"I just received the item, and they sent me the wrong one, and not body answer to me. I bought the one for samsung and they sent for a iphone."	0
"I just received this phone yesterday, but so far so good! I&apos;m completely in love with it! I thought it&apos;d be similar to my old razr but it&apos;s MUCH MUCH better! Not that there was anything wrong with my razr, but there were some features I wished were a little better and I think phone changed all of those features. It&apos;s much easier to navigate through this phone! I am very pleased!"	1
I JUST RECIVED THIS PHONE  LOOK VERY GOOD HOPE WORK GOOD AS LOOK IT NICE ITEM AND GREAT SERVICE HOPE TO DEAL	1
"I just started using this new iphone as an upgrade from my iphone 7+ and I couldnt be happier. My iphone 7 had been giving me problems for a while and despite my best efforts, the battery life would never last even close to 24 hours the way it used to do nor would I be able to raise the brightness above 25% if i wanted the battery to last even thru a normal work day. Im happy to say I do not have either of these issues any longer. Highly recommend upgrading to this fairly priced piece of technology if you're tired of dealing with battery issues and/or are looking for a good deal on a new phone in general. "	1
i just to talk to the seller about the product i wanted a refund and seller act like i did not know how to do my phone i will not buy from this seller again	0
"I just upgraded my ATT wireless family plan (Cingular wireless plan) for another two years. The deal allowed for selecting new mobile phones which we selected the Nokia 6126. The Nokia 6126 user guide states that the battery would last 10 days, 240 hours in standby mode. However, it is a big lie. I found out that the battery would be drained out completely in 2 days, 24 hours in standby mode. When I brought the phone back to ATT service center, the representative told me that, regardless the statement in the user guide, two days in standby mode is the norm. To prove his point, he would exchanged my Nokia 6126 with another Nokia 6126 that was checked and verified and sent back to the service center as an approved Nokia 6126 phone by the ATT corporation (including a new battery).  When I brought the approved Nokia 6126 home, I found out that this approved phone drained the battery completely in 1 and a half day, 36 hours. So I brought it back to the service center and requested to have my first Nokia 6126 back. In the end, the ATT corp. service center and Nokia phone company win even though they lie to consumer. I believe the manufacturer must state the battery life of its product reasonably close to the consumers environment and not alleging the ideal laboratory environment as argued by its service representative.    I asked my daughter and my brother, they both experienced the same problem, my daughter Nokia 6126 phone battery only lasts for 2 days or less. My brother Nokia 6126 phones battery lasts for 1 and a half day, worse than his previous Sony Erricsion phone z52s batter that can last for three or more days."	0
I just want to buy a iPhone X but I dont know why I was canceled transaction. I dont have more money to buy a new one because refunds need time to come back but I really need a new mobile phone right now.	0
"I just wanted to say that not only did I have to wait well over a month just to get the phone, now that i ve finally received it I ve installed the battery and let it charge and my phone doesnt even work.. I did put an active sims card in  too and no bleep or flash at all..Is there a magic button or something?I will be returning it...Hopefully it will get back faster than it got here...I did check the charger and that is not the problem.."	0
i just wish to inform you people that i haven't received this phone	0
"I killed my Pal Pixi Plus and purchased this as a replacement.  Doubled the memory and discovered that not only were all my settings and accounts saved to my Palm profile, the phone redownloaded and updated everything automatically, even down to the different icons I&apos;d chosen for my launcher, not the factory settings.  It&apos;s Comfy and fast and I&apos;m thrilled."	1
"I knew I was going to buy a phone in great condition considering it says grade A but this was seriously in mint condition It came as if I had just bought an iphone straight from the apple store. The box was even plastic sealed. Excellent condition, good pricing, and fast service. Thank you!"	1
I know I only pay a $1.29 but they should&apos;nt be selling this kind of stuff the sanyo scp 2400 that I bought from this ebay member was good for garbage an thats exactly were it is at.	0
"I know it said a little cosmetic damage One is good , but the 2nd is horrible  A lot of scratches on the screen and backside  I have to keep taping the screen to get it to go through "	0
I know that this was a used phone but it was in bad condition and I think that it should have been better described as a phone that was flawed.  The phone does work but it was not in good condition.	0
"I left just after ordering the phone and returned to find that I was sent one with a bad battery.  The battery wa replaced, however it took me a while to figure out that the phone only rang when it felt like it.    I guess they must think that that is something you should be able to figure out in a couple of minutes.  I must be the only person in the world that gets missed calls.  I wonder why they put that function on cell phones them.      That I was uable to figure out immediatly that I waws given aphone that only rang when it felt like it they told me that I was outof luck becasue I had exceded the warranteeperiod.    DO NOT BUY A CELL PHONE FROM THIS SITE!    THERE ARE PLENTY OF OTHER SITES THAT ACTUALLY STAND BEHIND THE PRODUCTS THE SELL, SO WHY TAKE A CHANCE.    DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND USE A DIFFERENT VENDOE TO BUY A CELL PHONE OR ANYTHING ELSE FROM."	0

"I like all Blackberrys. I decided to buy it because  it was in my price range. I like the messaging client on Blackberrys because it makes it a breeze to send a text, e-mail, or MMS."	1

"I like CDMA  phones better. They last 3 days, The GSN phones kast about 12 Hours."	0
"I like every bit of this phone! The screen quality is spectacular and the picture quality is great!! The QWERTY Keypad is a bit to get used to because the buttons don&apos;t stick out very far from each other, but once you get used to it, it works GREAT!! I recommend getting a shell or case for this phone. I owned a LG Xenon and dropped it a few times and it started getting really shaky, and the slider loosened a bit. So getting a drop-worthy case for your phone is always a plus. Unfortunately if you do not have AT&amp;T, You cannot use this phone until the previous contract expires. So if you plan to get one, and you are on a different cell provider, you make sure it can be unlocked right away and the previous contract has expired. Also, if you are going to unlock it, make sure you CALL AT&amp;T FOR THE CODE!!!! If you burn out the available TEN  tries to unlock it, the phone will COMPLETELY LOCK AND THUS BE IMPENETRABLE!!! Otherwise, a great phone and I would recommend it to anyone!     I got my product from tyler8707. If he is selling a product you are interested in, He is a great seller and will go above and beyond just the purchase!"	1
i like every think about the phone.the seller done a great job i like the phone because all the things it does like bluetooth cam.	1
"I like everything, the functionality, and the good-well engineer talents that they applied on the software. The only thing that i dont like is the short battery charged time (about 2-3 days) and that dont have card slot (but now is K750, i need to save some money). But overall i recommend this product."	1
"I like flip phone series more than the bar phones now-a-days. I mean i like the bar phones it&apos;s just.. flip phones are awesome. you flip it open to answer calls, then close it to end them. texting is very old school since it doesn&apos;t have the QWERTY feature but soon it&apos;ll have touch screen(qwerty) and i&apos;ll wait for those as well. this phone is supposedly unlocked but i can&apos;t say until i visit outside the states and get a sim card or something similar."	1
"I LIKE HOW IT IS NOT A SLIDE OR FLIP,IT IS SO EASY TO WORK.THE KEYS IS SMALL AND THAT IS THE ONLY FAULT I HAVE WITH IT.I HAD A BLACKBERRY TORCH AND SOLD IT CAUSE I GOT TIRED OF THE SLIDE PHONE.I WANTED A STRAIGHT PHONE THAT I DONT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE SLIDE PART MESSING UP.I HAD DONE MY RESEARCH AND HOMEWORK AND COULDN&apos;T DECIDE ON WHAT I WANTED IN A CELL PHONE,SO SOMETHING JUST LED ME BACK TO THE CURVE 8900 AND I DON&apos;T REGRET BUYING IT."	1
I like how the menus move. I like its sensitivity and organization.	1
i like how you can do email and alot of other options. i dislike the key pay to a point where you hit the wron letters if you have fat fingers. i wanted to buy this phone since it came out but prices where a little to high for what i think a phone is worth until i found one i like pricewise	1
"I like HTC by its compatibility with Microsoft, but I just do not buy the software is also not very common and it makes me difficult to maneuver"	0
I like it a lot because of the quality of the material and how usefull it is. My cellphone is really protected now. The car charger is very usefull because I usually am on the road because of my bussiness.	1
"i like it a lot, my other one died so got this new one hope it last a long time."	1

i like phone very much and is very good price	1
I like so much the cell 	1
I like that I falshed this item to cricket and it retained windows mobile which i use .  great features that help me function better and much less expensive than a two year plan with a main carrier. still more of a phone than a pricy small &quot;laptop&quot;.  connects with my laptop to save contacts etc... love it.  if I break or lose it i can get another inexpensive one on ebay.  voila.	1
"I like that it's clear and I can see the color of my phone. Sounds silly, huh?  Good product, though!!"	1
I like that the price of the phone was affordable for me. I love that it shipped so fast! I bought the phone because I needed a replacement phone and this BB was one of the only good conditioned affordable phones on the site!	1
"i like the 12.1 mega pixels only,  dislike the way the tex messages was set u as, i decided to buy his phone because it was described very good phone"	0
I like the applications that are available for the Treo. It sure makes it nice not having to get on a computer to do a lot of things I can do on the phone. The ability to sync via bluetooth is great since I&apos;m using a 64-bit Windows 7. The clarity of the calls is great and the options for the phone is great!	1
"I like the big screen, but the battery is a big draw back. Otherwise, it&apos;s a great phone, I recommend this phone to anyone who likes android devices!!!"	1

I like the color of this telephone. The simplicity of it is also nice. I use a fancy Blackberry on a daily basis. For special occassions I wanted a slim smaller phone to simply use to make telephone calls. I had one a long time ago and liked it. Now I am happy pleased to own another one again. Thank you. It works just fine.	1
"i like the double min.,no contracts,quality and features of this phone.i bought one in december this one i bought for my brother for his bday,he activated it today and loves it."	1
I like the fact it was in its original packaging.  The description was vary accurate.  I would highly reccomend it.	1
"i like the fact that my phone was ship rapidly, within 2 or 3 days. However the phone was useless, i try to work it out with the seller, but it turns i did not read the fine print, but still i feel they should not sell trash, but anyways now i have to buy another phone."	0
I like the fact that this phone is small and kid-friendly as such.  My daughter is thrilled about the fact that this phone is explicitly for her and she would have it no other way....the phone was very reasonably priced and now only requires activation.	1
"I like the fast shipping and the way the phone looks.  The seller got back to me when my daughter was unable to set up the answering system because it was locked.  She gave us her code to open it. Unfortunately the MP3 player doesnt work.  According to the seller it was never used as an MP3 player so she didnt know it didnt work.  I, on the other hand, was buying it because of the MP3 player. It was the same phone that was stolen from my daughter so I wanted to replace it.  Now when she takes the bus she needs to take a phone and her other MP3 player because the one on the phone doesnt work.  I just wish that everything worked.  Camera is fine, cosmetics of the phone is good....but no MP3.  Disappointing"	0
I like the galaxy I couldn&apos;t afford the newer one but this is a great phone very easy to use clear screen.  I really like it.	1
I like the hd quality. The screen is big . Easy to use . Awesome personalization features 	1
I like the lg shine so much i bought 4 of them so i wouldnt have to worry about getting a new phone and not know how to use it. Thing is only 2 out of the 4 are any good. The 2 bad ones one of them just sitting around and drains the battery in a hour or 2 and the other one cant seem to detect a sim card.	0
"I like the looks, and it&apos;s been a hard cell phone to learn it&apos;s features but  when you are having a conversation you can&apos;t hear a thing. Then you lose your  connection with the other person. Then you have to call them back. I haven&apos;t been able to even use the phone to talk to anybody."	0
I like the phone a lot. It's held up pretty great and I have no complaints. 	1
"I like the phone and contact the seller before purchase it to check if the phone is unlock. The seller told me he phone is unlock but when I received it, i test out used the a local sim card. It does not work. THE PHONE IS LOCK. I lost USD$70.    : ("	0

I like the screen its big and I love the little scrill thing that it has in the center it makes it easier for me to go here and there	1
I like the simplicity and ease of use of this phone. The clam shell is a very good way to protect the keys without having to lock them.	1
"I like the size and shape, and that&apos;s about it.     Touchscreen is way worse than an iphone. Interface is laggy. Camera is bad..."	0
"I like the size of the phone ,the blu tooth and the ease of operation.All the features are easy to find.The battery last a long time for a mater of days .I leave mine on all the time and it takes days before it needs charged.The color is attractive .Keys are adequate size to use comfortably.I would by one agin ."	1
I like the smallness because I can hide it easily. It makes a good internet phone and it's good with iMessage	1
"I like the style and more but the only thing I don&apos;t like is the battery doesn&apos;t last long,i bought this cell because was betty chip and I like it"	1
I like the touch screen and the expandable memory the thing i dont like is that i drop alot of calls for some reason with this phone. This is the only phone i have had that drops calls like this one.	0
"I like the two front cameras, Wide angle and the options it has  There was a bug at the left top corner, had to restart my phone everytime i play a game.. but its worth it. the phone has no other issues and i believe that bug was a software system bug.  Great work LG, Keep it up!"	1
i like the way it was exactly how they dwscribed it.my daughter loves it. so that means i love it. do business with this person. very good	1
"I like the way they look, feel and handle. Also, the way they can do things that we could not do to older phones. These phones are fun,  I do like where it has a &quot;sleep mode&quot; where you can have the screen on secure and not have to worry about accidently hitting a wrong key etc.! And when someone calls you, you can answer without having to &quot;unlock&quot; your key pad.      The features are numerous. I keep finding new and itneresting things these phones can do. They are nice to handle, no flipping to open the phone, has GPS capabilities, has a big list of options to choose from and the list goes on. On the down side they can be pretty complicating to confusing. Make sure you have a phone that has not been used much. The one I bought had a battery that would only hold a charge for about 3-4 days depanding on how much I used it. I was able to get a new battery for it. It seems to do very well! ( I bought my phone used.      Hope this helps someone to decide whether to get one. You would NOT be disappointed if you did get one!   Michael Richardson"	1
I like this cell phone because is easy and I love it my wife used before and she told me to buy this kind of cell phone and it is has full keyboard and easy to use.	1
"i like this gadget ,iphone far as i know this is the most advanced mobile phones this year  goods from apple always qualified, and I really want to give my girlfriend, because she will repeat the year. and I&apos;m sure she was very pleased"	1

"I like this phone because I like what I saw, how fast  on apps, I wanted it, Now that I got it I love this phone, I recommend it, its light weight small enough to excersice,i had iphone prior to this, this is way better, now my husband wants one! Ive had so many phones in the past 6 months. Wasnt happy. I found my match! I forgot to mention,its water resistant and glass its tough it wont get scratched easily,no more ugly protectors!"	1
I like this phone because it has an mp3 player and its my favorite color. I decided to buy it because i wanted a different phone	1
"I like this phone because it was easy for me to figure out. I can also use it to surf the internet, it has GPS, and a ton of other really good features. It&apos;s not an expensive phone, and except for the fact you should never wash it in a washing machine, it works really well.    If you are looking for an inexpensive phone that does a lot, this is the one I recommend. Other than not being able to immerse it in water, it is pretty sturdy."	1
"I Like this Phone Because, I can count on it to get the job done.For example I can text,call,send pics,and more with out no problem..."	1
"I like this phone due to it&apos;s retina display, storage capacity, sleek design, smooth finishing, user friendly operating system, extremely sensitive touch screen,  etc.    There is no software in the market yet, to unlock this phone.  Even if it is not unlocked, I can make calls through Viber.    Awaiting for RedSnow to come up with an unlocking software."	1
i like this phone so much i got the second one...very easy to work and ok reception in a place where reception is bad....	1
"I like this phone, does everything it needs to.  Color screen, ring tones, compact, and neet looking.  It has built in sim chip which I like, dont have to switch chips."	1
"I like this phone, sorry no english, no time for translation, thank you...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................."	1
"I like this phone. So, i give 5star for this."	1
"I like this Sprint Android phone that has both a full size Qwerty keyboard and a touch-pad interface.  Excellent graphics, excellent options, excellent apps, and overall a very pleasant and easy to use phone.  Not heavy or large, and with my new cell phone cover it looks amazing!"	1
"I like to be able to use the touch screen, styling and functionality  very easy browser surfing and emailing is breeze. I recommend the torch  9800, because the best of the B&gt;B"	1
I like very much the phone. It is perfect and cheap and work perfectly. It solved the problems that I had with nexel phones.	1
I like your business 	1

I liked dealing with this person because they were honest enough to correct a misunderstanding on my purchase. I would deal with them again if I needed to because of this.Thanks again!!!!	1
"I liked everything about the phone, easy to use, and a great looking phone. Unfortunately I felt the need to return it which had nothing to do withe the quality of the phone. The customer service was wonderful, understanding and prompt in returning emails on questions I had."	1
I liked how fast and how the seller communicated. and i bought it because i believed it would be a good product.	1
i liked it because it was fast and quick and the person who gave me this phone gave it to me with good intentions that it whould be taken from onee clean enviromental friendly home to another	1
"I liked it so much I bought a 2nd one. Easy sync to Mac I-Sync, Easy to program, I would highly recomend this phone to all my friends"	1
"I liked item because was pink,good buy ang perfect. Phone is in great condition. no scratches good picture quality had manual with car and wall charger."	1
I liked that I got a good deal on the item. The listing did not have a picture so I feel that most people are scepticale on the items condition. Although the item was in great shape which would have been well illusrtated by a picture. The product was true to the description. I think that it would have made him more money if he had a pic.	0
"I liked that the item was barely used and still in its new packaging, plus shipping was great. thanx"	1
"I liked that when I ordered the orignial product, it came fast. Also, when I had questions, I was supplied a number to contact the dealer directly, and my issues were resolved quick and professionaly. He replaced the things that needed, and was very polite. Its very much appreciated!"	1
"I liked the blackberry tour while it lasted, unfortunately i could not connect it to my current network i am on. the shipping and communication was great!. i was very pleased with the phone and was sad i had to give it back!."	1
I liked the clear screen and pretty easy way to navigate around the phone but  it is more like a computer than a phone.  The sound quality of this phone is terrible and people on the receiving end say the same; very hard to hear and choppy.  I would prefer to have an iTouch for wireless needs and stay with my cheaper Samsung phone.	0
"I liked the fact that the transaction was fast and smooth.HOWEVER-the product was a battery,case,charger and a couple of small assessories--the charger/battery destroyed my daughters phone.   My feedback was premature and incorrect !!!!"	0
"I liked the look of this phone and my past Sony cell phone always pleased me, but with this I keep losing a signal. The person on the other side of the phone cannot  hear me and I cannot hear them. What a shame, I have gone back to my old Sony cell phone. what a pity."	0
i liked the phone because i was told it brand new.  but it was a lie.they sent me a used phone.  i didn&apos;t like the service at all	0
"I liked the phones' capabilities, but within a few weeks of owning the phone, a light oily fluid started leaking from the phone. It caused the display to be unreadable. Since it was bought from a seller on ebay, the warranty has already expired."	0
"I liked the product, but it was my fault because I neglected to read through and see that she did not offer paypal or another secure form of payment.  She wanted me to send her a cashier&apos;s check or money order (no personal checks), for the item.  I was not going to risk that because she was a brand new seller and/or buyer.  She had 1 review.  I wrote to her and explained that if she wanted to set up paypal, which will protect me and her, I would buy the item.  If not, then I would walk away.       She reported me to Ebay and left me negative feedback but I don&apos;t care.  I have been a good ebayer for years and she is the only negative comment I have received.  I rather take the negative comment then loose my money, as I have had that happen to me before on Ebay, and they did nothing to help me.  Loosing $600 is a lot worse than loosing $150, but it&apos;s still the principle behind the matter.        Ebay services are ideal but buyers must be smart about what they&apos;re willing to purchase.  One mistake may cost anyone a lot of money."	0
"I liked the Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini.  I love the S5 version.  I wish that Samsung would have continued this size phone in their newer lines.  Since they don't, I am glad I could find the S5 mini."	1
"i liked the style of phone, i needed one,it was avaliable, so i bougnt it. thanks11111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111"	1
I liked the way the lg phone i purchased looked online and even once i recieved it. It came with a case charger and of course the phone. After about two weeks the part of the charger that goes into the phone broke off and was unusable. Also within that time period I noticed that the phone would ocassionaly go blank on the outside and inside screen. This is sometimes easily cured by flipping the phone open and close but sometimes requires me too turn the unit off and on and even then I may have to do it a second time to recover the screen. Other than that I atleast like how the phone looks.	0
I liked this phone alot but it was just too slow and none of the apps would open after I downloaded them. Sure wish this phone worked! A really slow phone.	0
I liked this phone very much however I had a lot of network work issues with this phone. I eventually had to get a new phone	0
"I listed terrible because there was no lower choice! I bought the phone to replace broken phone(same model) to use with t-mobile. Putting old sim card to activate it was a bust. Do you want t know the hoops? It can't be activated because it wasn't scanned. [because you can do that on an internet ebay purchase?] 1. get the receipt from tekdeals, (their purchase)to show it wasn't stolen. *no phone# contact information available.  2. Print off the receipt from my purchase from tekdals showing transaction number. 3. Get a ticket number from Tmobile's tech support. 4. get the sim# from current phone. 5. Email all the information to tech support. 6. Wait up to ten days for activation. The stupid phone cost $16. the trouble alone would have been 3X that. Just went to best buy and got a new phone.    Lesson learned, never buy a phone on the internet unless you can scan it."	0
"I live in Kazakhstan. after unlock works perfectly, very pleased with this purchase, I advise everyone who is thinking about this device acquisition of a"	1
"I live in Russia. Iphone 7 model A1660 in Russia or Europe is not for sale and turned on eBay. My chosen seller does not have much experience selling on eBay, but is responsible for selling. Iphone7 operator Verizon, was bought out a contract and received Unlocker and untied from the iCloud account. All information about Iphone, claimed by the seller; Iphone7 was in operation for only 4 months, no scratches or other defects on the screen and the case, the state of Unlocker and untied from the iCloud account were fully confirmed. There were no problems with the activation of Iphone7. EBay can be trusted for the quality of goods sold. "	1
"I look this phone on ebay and they advertise lots of function on inexpensive phone and I bought two phone. When I received both phone was not work, I send back China with my shipping expense $44.00 and he take too long to send me back. I received today new phone but he forget to give me car charger and earphone, pen for calibration now he going to send me again and take another month very poor service. The new phone he send me its still problem battery not charging good. Its stay for one hour without talk time. Just we loose money. We never buy this Item again."	0
I looked up best cheap phones on YouTube and I found this and I looked up at specs and all that stuff in the safe to give it a shot I bought it on here and it came sooner I said just like like a review I read it came faster it came on Monday but it came on Saturday and I love that and the Chargers great it charges fast and battery life is long really long as far as I can tell so far the fingerprint scanner works just fine the phone is really big and it's that's really good because it has split screen mode which allows you to watch Netflix for you too while your texting your friends and I like that because I can never get on my old phone the camera is great quality I've taken a picture so far and it looks beautiful I love it like Mike I'm using the mic right now actually so like if you want like if you want to be able to tell have a good time like is this is using voice to text so you this is how you tell how good the mic is not the best	1

I love but am still learning alot...I had a different make that used to get very hot burning my hand.. The HTC ONE A9 SO far doesn't get too hot..I would recommend it to anyone who need a good phone at a great price...Rosemarie Sutherlin.	1
I love everything about it. The phone works great. and it looks good to. I love the camera and video. This phone is awsome. I love the fact that i can have real music as a ringtone.	1
"I love everything about the phone. It might take you a few days to get used to the phone because of all the functions it has. Once you get used to the phone, you start to figure it all out and get to enjoy it even more.  The seller is great and super fast shipping. I think I got mine in twoays. Dont hesitate to buy this phone because it is great and well worth its money!!!!!"	1
"i love everything about the phone. the sidekick 2008 make it easier to go on aim, yahoo messenger. you can receive your email in your phone. the thing i love the most is how easy you can change the phone color. you can have a color for any dress or mood for only $15. you can even put your face on the phone. it&apos;s so cooool. if you are fan of music, well you can downlaoad music right into your phone. i recommend it to all. it&apos;s fantastic."	1

I love having the stylus right there whenever I want to use it. Love having the option to keep handwritten notes in the phone including my grocery list.	1
"I love how the item shipped arrived the next day and the item was just as described, in perfect condition and seller sent tracking information as well so I could track my item, Im very pleased with this seller and highly recommend them for future buyers."	1

I love it! Fast charger work and the battery life last longer 	1
"I LOVE IT!!! The phone is beautiful. Looks brand new!! Shiny, sophisticated, light weight. The touch screen works wonderfully. I would say it went over my expectations! Easy to use. I just absolutely love it!! The only thing I would have to say is that it didn&apos;t come with the stylus, but then again it wasn&apos;t mentioned in the product description. Which makes it fair. But a stylus isn&apos;t needed. The phone gives you the option of using your finger or a mouse arrow like the one you have on a computer, the one you use move around on the screen and click things with. I would definitely buy from this place again!!! THANKS A TON!!!!!!!!!"	1
"I love it!!!!!, the most wonderful smartphone. Easy, fast.my husband recommended it to me. Dislike??, anything, EVERYTHING is beautiful"	1
"I love it, fully functional "	1
"I love it, it had a few scratches & a tiny crack  on the screen but  that was fixable. I bought a faster memory card  & it works great!!"	1
"I love it,it is one of the fastest smarphones, and it has the best app store!  The design is really good, and the camera is incredible, now the jailbreak is legal so you can get a lot of new interfaces and free apps :D  I really recommend this phone!"	1
I love it.  It is so easy to use.  It takes wonderful pictures and is fast and it is exactly what I was looking for	1
"I love it. Fast shipping. Works great. Only one regret , I didn't  order protection with"	1
I love it. It&apos;s easy to use and to understand. Even though It&apos;s size is so confortable that fits in my jean&apos;s pocket It also has a wide screen.	1
"I love it. It's lightweight and powerful. I have to be honest that I was skeptical about buying phones on eBay, but this one seems to be the real deal. It doesn't hurt that it even included a protective shell!"	1
I love it. Takes me back in time and it is simple. Talk and text.	1
I love LG phones they are cool looking and easy to use.   I bought this cell phone because my cell phone would not  work at all and I needed a new phone. I have had a LG   phone before and they where easy for me to you and   worked great for me. I love my phone that I bought and  the cost of the phone was good. So far this phone work  pretty good for me. I thnk out of all the phones that I  had up until now this one I think is the best that I have  had so far. There is really nothing I can say about this   phone that I dislike it. I will most likely get this phone  for myself or for somebody else in the near future. Love   this phone alot. Thank you very much     Paige	1
I love my  Samsung Galaxy Note 2.  I had one previously but dropped and broke it and the screen blacked out on me. My granddaughter let me use her Galaxy Note 7 since she had gotten a new phone. Nothing takes the place of my Note 2. I felt like I had hit the lottery when it arrived in the mail. It's not the latest version but you can't go wrong with it. I wouldn't trade it for the world. Love it. Love it. Love It.	1
I love my cel phone is like new :) nice service and nice people nice :)  	1
I love my HTC EVO. I have been working on getting one since October and am so excited to finally have it. I has been easy to learn being new to smart phones but I am enjoying every second of it. No regret buy here!	1
I love my iphone 5c - perfect size -great battery life and all around tough - switched to iphone 6 and switched right back to my 5c ! ..excellent apple product :)	1
I love my LG G5.  It has a large easy to read screen.  It has a fast processor.  It has a lot of internal memory with a slot to expand with a SD Card.  It is a great phone that I bought from a great eBay seller.	1
I love my mega the seller was not honest when they sold it. It was already activated on someone else acct and activation card in the metro pcs phone. Due to this I made a informed decision to discontinue my business with eBay and try to tell as many customers I can about my experience with eBay and their dishonest sellers. So buy at your own risk because sellers can lie to get your money and eBay will protect them.	0
I love my new Galaxy s8 Active! It arrived right on time and works great!	1

i love my phone and haven&apos;t had no problems with it at all. it was just as described and shipped promptly. would recommend to others and would purchase again from seller.	1
I love my phone it is much better than what I had.	1
"I love my phone!  So much better than the LG Optimus it replaced. (No lagging here!!)  I don&apos;t care if it&apos;s the older version of the Samsung Galaxy; the S3 is just fine for my needs.  I&apos;m a busy mom of 4 involved in all the kid-bizz plus my own part-time work; I need a phone that works FOR ME, and quickly, and efficiently, and that&apos;s what this baby does.  I love the stylin&apos; white color and disagree that it looks &quot;cheap&quot; as some have said. I like the camera, too.  I&apos;m no tech-savvy girl but I know this is a good phone, and that it works well enough for my needs.  Plus the eBay price made me happy, too.  Plenty of other things to spend money on!!"	1
"I love my phone, it works great, and shipping was fast!"	1
I love my phone. Exactly as pictured. Looks brand new and very nice. Good communication from seller. Thanks! 	1
"I love my S3!Best phone ever! I love the size, and overall appearance! You can do so much on this phone. Its easy to use, and I love svoice, it finds anything you need it to, plus it gives you someone to talk to when you get bored! I would recommend it to any and everyone!"	1
I love my samsung gloss sch-u440-charcoal (U.S. Cellular) Cellular Flip Phone.  I had one just like this a few years ago and couldn't wait until I found another to buy Thanks.	1
"I love my white iPhone 4!!! Best iPhone you can buy!!! It&apos;s truly amazing!!! HD recording, FaceTime talk, all the app&apos;s you could ask for. Gina"	1
"I love Nokia phones. This is the best phone ever i had.  Excellent features just to highlight the accessibility, easy to use, sound quality and camera."	1
I love P20 Pro from my home country rather than iPhone.	1
I love purchasing things from this seller. The service is quick with quality.  	1
"I love Samsung products, ...this phone is awesome for the price"	1
I love that its a touch screen and has a keyboard also! I got this phone because one of my friends had one and i fell in love with it.	1
"i love that the ebay seller was so descriptive and honest about the phone. i really enjoy the touch and qwerty keyboard. it is a simple, easy phone that receives emails and closes so i don&apos;t have to worry about locking my keypad. it is really easy to load stuff onto my micro sd like music and ringtones. i&apos;m really happy with it and the camera is set up to take your picture! what girl wouldn&apos;t love that!"	1
I love that the seller responded to me quickly after I sent a message about wanting to cancel and order. He was very understanding and I appreciated that. Thank you!	1
"I love that this phone has the bigger screen.   Got a lot of newer /nice functions that the original droid doesn&apos;t have, plus it seem to run a lot smoother and faster that the original Droid."	1
"I love the apps, including the open source format of the entire phone. This is why I use Linux on my laptop as well, because the technology that we use to enrich our lives should be free and available to anyone.     Phone runs great, the keyboard is easy to use and easily accessible. The only issue I have is that incoming notifications interrupt the music if you&apos;re listening to songs from the phone through headphones, and that you need an adapter for a normal 3.5mm headphone jack.     Other than that, great phone, works well, love it, so long as you have an unlimited data plan."	1
"I love the big screen. It completely makes up for the lack of a physical keyboard. The touch screen is much more responsive than the original Droid.    Navigation, apps, music, movies make this phone an all around great buy!"	1
"I love the BlackBerry Keyone! I never thought it would be easy to switch from BBOS to Android, or that I could love an Android device, but BlackBerry has succeeded at both with this phone! It has excellent battery life, brings BlackBerry features, such as the BlackBerry hub, over to Android, as well as all new features, such as the ability to assign every key on your keyboard to be a shortcut to open anything you assign it to (e.g. ""g"" for google maps, ""a"" for amazon, ""b"" for browser, etc.). No other Android device offers this feature. To top it all off, BlackBerry is the most secure Android device on the market.  So, if you love BlackBerry, but want to make the move to Android for the apps, now is the time to do it. The BlackBerry Keyone will make the transition a smooth, easy, and pleasurable one. "	1
I love the celphone that i bought LG Cookie KP500 its great very easy to use and i am very satisfied and i recommend it to those who want to buy the new cellphone im sure you loved it too! Excellent!!!!!!!!!	1
"i love the color,the case and everything that came with it.it was in perfect condition there is no dislikes.i loved it"	1
I love the design and quality of calls. Thank you for selling me this phone	1
I love the details given by the seller. The were very accurate with the description and details about my purchase. I would make purchases from them in the future. I love my new Motorola Karma.     Thank you	1
"I LOVE the ease of use with this phone! It&apos;s lightening FAST with everything it does! By far, my favorite cell phone!! I&apos;d recommend it to anyone!!!"	1
"I love the fact its simple to use,i never really text people and since i got this phone i have been texing every body. I use to have a razr phone and one day it ring and i went to answer it and it just broke in two, and it was the updated version i was so disapointed with that phone any way i am happy with this phone.Thanks again"	1
"I love the fact that it has an endless supply of applications to make my life easier and more fun, this product is great and it will make you love how mobile computing has increased over the years"	1
"I love the features but I can't get more than 18 hrs of battery I standby.  Moderate use causes battery drain in about 10 hours.  Not useable.  In hoping it's just the phone.  Will return for a replacement and see.  Great seller, though."	0
i love the htc g1 even though it is an out dated phone now. still its the best and i love it. i like how the keys on the keyboard are not right next to each other and spaced out so in case you have wide thumbs like i do you can type unlike some other phones. you can get a ton of free apps and have fun. now granted the g1 is the first android but i was amazed how quick it loads pages for email and yes even youtube videos so if and when you want to show a funny video you can. the clarity is awesome and depending who your service provider is im with t mobile and i have had no hic ups at all with the video or emails. you also have a wi-fi radio that enables you to connect to your wi-fi router so in case you live in a dead zone (like me) you can do that. this phone has a lot more options than i can say. if you are going to get a smart phone make sure it has not been hacked other wise it will ruin your experience. i got mine that was treated awesomely and it was not modified. in short?? g1 rocks. :)	1
i love the i phone it does everythig with a bunch of apps if you get this phone you wont regret it it does everything u wanted to do	1
I love the Iphone 4. This is the best cellphone in the world.  Excellent phone. All is well. No damage or scratches.  Excellent seller. Thanks a lot!	1
"I love the itunes.  I am a full time college student.  Between the backpack filled with books and binders this makes 1 less thing I need to make sure is in the pack, my ipod.  This is my phone and my music, and the best part I could use the software and music lists I already had for my ipod.  Speaker volume is great, I love this phone!!  Clarity is very good, really a great phone for the price."	1
I love the keypad it make&apos;s texting so easy and fast.The touch screen is realy nice too!!!And you can adjust the sensitivity of the screen which is realy nice also.There is nothing I dislike about this phone.	1
"I love the lenovo phab 2 pro purchased from this seller. I been wanting this phone for a long time but didnt not wanted to pay the regular price, so i bid on this tem and i just want to say that im very glad i bought from this seller because the phone is in great physical condition. Thank you so much for making it available to sell in the eBay Marketing."	1
"I love The Mate 10 pro. Great looking phone, high end specs, excellent build quality and Superior camera. I also own the Note 8 and I can say that this camera on the mate 10 pro takes better pictures than the Note 8. No Joke. The quality of the pictures that this phone takes will blow you away. Why the US want to keep Huawei out of retail stores is crazy. I think they know that it will kill the other major Android manufactures or force them to go down on their prices.  "	1
I love the my new phone. Thank you  	1
"I love the new phone that I have. The phone came with everything: the directions, charger, cases, and more. The phone had NO SCRATCHES on it, and it looked as good as new. I love the phone itself, and this was the best purchase I have made on ebay! The seller was very helpful and quick to respond to questions that I had. The seller sent the phone right away!"	1
I love the overall form factor and software of the phone. I love motorla and i think these are great phones.	1
I love the phone	1
I love the phone a lot of features and a great selction of apps. The only negative part would be the battery life I have to charge it a least once a day.	1
I love the phone and the seller is a gem.	1
"i love the phone but could not use it for att try to ask seller to request the code butto provide  he dotn want to help me out,  he offer to refund money back.The deal is not the money just conviennie dont have time for refund this and that but i guess that ok"	0
"I love the phone but within days of having it 5gigs of data were GONE, without viewing videos or downloading music? This is the only phone that's used so much data. Also I haven't even had it for a month and horizontal gray lines appeared on the bottom of the screen as I was web browsing. boost will only fix if I send it out for 7-10 days leaving me without a phone. Idk, good phone with major flaws."	0
I love the phone i hate that apple has bluetooth locked down to headset or handsfree only...i like to bluetooth stuff from my phone to my computer and cant and no one has software delveloped yet to do this...so sad ...but the phone is awesome....	1

I love the phone stylo 2 plus thank you so much !  	1
"I love the phone! It&apos;s compact, and durable but it cannot be used with the Sprint Network...so now I have a phone I can&apos;t use unless I come up with the deposit for Verizon....being unlocked I thought it would work. Hubby isn&apos;t very happy....200.00 is a lot of money for a phone to gather dust!"	1
"i love the phone, but do to the fact the owner didn&apos;t have the phone disconnect, so i can used it. i can&apos;t used it."	0
"i love the phone, its just that it has water damge, and wasn&apos;t able to activate on the network it was suppose to, also I think that the water damage interfered with the wifi. I&apos;m demanding for a refund and hope he gives it to me. I will post a feed back commet depend on how the vibe I get back from me, and of course if he says yes or not. But overall if he phone was working properly I would give it an A+. It is in good condition, and comes with everything it he says it comes with. I  just don&apos;t understand why he didn&apos;t tell me about the phone history, and that the youtube, and wifi in genrally is crappy. Maybe its from the water damage but I really Don&apos;t know. The seller has fast shipping, and also good communcation. still a great seller but next time write the full details,(even if it is the smallest thing) about the item you have to sell, so you won&apos;t have this problem agian. Thank you for reading this and I hope you get some understanding on how I feel about this phone."	0
"I love the phone, service was excellent from seller. The price was a price that you could not got any other place. All accessories came with phone as stated in the auction."	1
"I love the phone,but I am still learning how to use its full capacity. What I&apos;m not don&apos;t like is the small fonts when I go to Media net. All together I think I bought the correct phone for me."	1
I love the phone.  I have no dislike about the phone.  I decide to buy the phone because I needed a phone and the features on the phone.  It is just what I wanted.	1
"I love the phone. I couldn't. More happy with this company. Great service, fast service and good quality service. "	1
I love the phone. In the ad it said scratches and dents although I found the phone to be in pristine condition. Had no problem changing from my old phone to this one at the AT&T store. Only problem was it took two weeks to get here because of weather conditions in different states.	1
"I love the phone. It was also still in a pretty decent condition with normal wear. Besides that, everything works great!"	1
"I love the phone. Quick service and easy transaction. Great ebayer. The phone is exactly as I expected, brand new and works great."	1
i love the phone....the quality of the phone is bad....the battery stinks on the phone....i have to charge it every night eventhough i went out a bought a new battery for it....i think it is a manufactures defect....other then that the phone is a very good phone takes pictures very well...and all other features are great...	0
"i love the price ,i love the fact it got to me in just two weeks,that was fast,it was well pack,i got every piece with it"	1
I love the product	1
I love the quickfire I bought from you.  It was neatly packaged and the service was great.  It got to me super quick.  Thanks.	1
"I love the S6 it's slim, easy to understand how it works. I'm in love lol"	1
"I Love the shape of the phone , ideal to text and web browsing .not too exited about ring tones. But Overall i Rate this phone as A++"	1
I love the size but many flaws does not connect to LTE. So far I only have 4g. But still like the phone I love big sized phones 	0

"I love the slash phone and i was devastated when virgin mobile quit selling them discontinued them, its a  GREAT phone and your service was excellent.    thanks so very much!!"	1
I love the touch screen. I have dropped it a few times and do have a few scratches on the screen but the phone still works perfectly. I decided to buy it because I was switching phone companies to Virgin Mobile to save some money plus they have cooler phones than Straight talk. All around it is an awesome phone! Thanks!!	1
"I love the Vu and I am so glad that I could have it on my network instead. : ) The look of the phone is great. I had to unlock the picture messaging myself, but it was not hard at all."	1
"I LOVE the way the HTC Aria functons. It has a really sensitive touch screen. I love the way it links my social networks, and my different e-mail accounts to my phone. I rarely even use my lap-top computer anymore, and that&apos;s miraculous! The only drawback is that the battery-life is not as long as I expected, so I have to keep my charger with me when I&apos;m not home (Just in case). Overall, I LOVE my HTC ARIA and would recommend it to others."	1
"I LOVE THE WAY THIS PHONE IS PRESENTED, FEATURES ARE AMASEZING. 5 MEGAPIXEL CAMARA AND THE PRICE IS JUST RIGHT... I REALLY RECOMMEND THIS ITEM TWO THUMBS UP."	1
I love these windows phones but for some reason my cell service doesn't work all the time and I didn't realize Microsoft doesn't upgrade this particular phone. Very sad about that	1
I love this Can't ask for a better phone!	1
"i love this cell phone that i bought on here, and the person was VERY understanding and took  it back and fixed it for me :-).  I got this phone on here cuz the one i bought in the store didnt keep charge for more then five min. this phone keeps charge and i love it, cuz i do talk alot and text. I would bye from this person if i ever et the chance to again and the price was very cheap all in all im very happy with what i got."	1
"I love this cellphone, the price is good, i reply recommend the cellphone.............................................................................................. ................................................"	1
"I love this tem and you services, thanks for be busisness "	1
I love this little phone.  The only problem I have is texting.  I have arthritis and holding this little phone and texting is sometimes hard.  Otherwise I love the size and ease of use.	1
"I LOVE this model c/phone!!!!!!!  Great item and a great price!!!   AAAAA  Old one was 3+ yrs old and getting tired - and I didn&apos;t like the other ones on the market.  I like the way it opens, can read it in the daylight, etc."	1
I love this phone	1
I love this phone	1
"I love this phone .It is very responsive and has so many great features. The  camera takes great pictures. I also like the size of  the phone , it fits perfectly in the hand. Before I received this phone, I was using an android phone that was a little larger, but after awhile I was having trouble with it's responsiveness so I am so much happier with this iPhone ,it is the best ! "	1
I love this phone and couldn&apos;t ask for more. The asthetics are second to none and the Android O/S is fantastic. This phone has a great display and slide-out keyboard which make web/texting/apps easy and fun to use. The only negative is the low battery life which requires charging regularly. I have had the opportunity to upgrade for some time now and can&apos;t find a better Android phone available for Sprint.	1
I love this phone and havent had any problems with it. I got it in coral and love it! Would recommend!  	1
I love this phone and the price was %75 cheaper compared to than an iPhone.	1
I love this phone because it is just that--a phone.  The industrial design is really nice too.  It works internationally and it&apos;s small and compact.  It fits well in my pocket but doesn&apos;t like the warmth in a confined space.  I&apos;m on my 3rd T28 and can&apos;t seem to make the jump to the newer generation phones.	1
"I love this phone bought it slightly used and it was like new, love the QWERTY key board thats why I upgraded was to get that keyboard but I love everything about this phone and the seller had great price at buy it now, and mailed the item quickly, couldnt have ask for a better deal, at first I thought the phone might be a little too bulky but I got use to the width very quickly and and very well pleased with the phone and the transaction."	1
I love this phone i have had it for over a month and i have no complains except the battery life which is understandable for such a big screen.. and anyone with a phone like this one would use it all day causing it to die faster. but over all it is one of the best ones no issues 4g is super fast downloads apps in less than 5 seconds.. def. recomend it	1
i love this phone i needed o buy a new one cuz i broke mine.. its a good cheap phone that was at the right prive for me at the time thanks	1
I love this phone it came brand new and working great clean and nice 	1
i love this phone it has not given me any problems i love the color the full keyboad i would buy this phone again if it broke on me.	1
I LOVE THIS PHONE IT IS MUCH NICER THAN IPHONE 4 IT HAS EVERY FEATURE YOU CAN THINK OF it has great camera it has face talk it has 4g it has a fast processor it has voice activatin it has navagation and it works perfect for tmobile service	1
"I love this phone its awesome, its easy to use. Lots of stuff to use on it, cool texting. Nice buttons. Small and thin. Easy to store."	1
I LOVE THIS PHONE ITS LITE HAS 1GB OF STORAGE SPACE EASY TO USE FANTASTIC COLOR SCREEN! GREAT PRODUCT! YOU CANT GO WRONG WITH LG!	1
I love this phone so far its  been amazing. Only thing i wish it had was wireless charging. Other than that its awesome.	1
I love this phone so much. It works amazingly and is worth every penny! It was a really cheap iPhone and I definitely recommend it to anyone! 	1
I love this phone the older iOS is so much better great seller thank you!	1
"I love this phone!  I wanted a slightly larger form factor than my Galaxy S9.  The S9+ is perfect.  The Note 9 is a beautiful device but you have to consider how large the phone will be after installing a case.  The S9+ is perfect.  I am a male and keep it in my front pocket.  Also, the burgundy color is unique in the U.S. and really stands out.  Having the dual sim is a bonus.  I may or may not use it but I love having the option.  Remember, with dual sims installed you cannot install a micro SD also without a special external adapter so having the larger 128GB RAM S9+ also helps take care of that problem.  Did I say that love this phone?  It's perfect.  The only thing I might fault is: even though it has a larger battery than the S9, the S9+ battery doesn't seem to last any longer but I do use my phone a lot including playing and streaming music and playing games.  That said, I still am totally satisfied.  I love how the Samsung phone seems endlessly customizable and with the new One UI and Android Pie operating system it's better than ever!"	1
"I love this phone!  Not because I've used it but because it can survive my wife.  She has tried everything to get this phone to stop working - it has been dropped, thrown, chewed, rained-on, and generally abused - and it has kept on kicking.  She even left it on the front of my truck, from where it fell and endured the asphalt and two tires-worth of 4x4 torment, and all that happened was a cracked screen.  She used the phone for months until I just couldn't take the cracked screen anymore, so I bought a second one!  If you want a flip phone and don't mind a little extra bulk and padding, this one won't disappoint."	1
i LOVE this phone! I&apos;ve always wanted one but they were out of my price range. But i found the price for this phone to be reasonable. I&apos;m truly satisfied with my phone.	1
"I love this phone! It has the newest capabilities, so I can have the most updated apps! The battery life is amazing and the QWERTY keyboard is accurate and efficient! It is nice to be able to use the touchscreen feature and then flip to the QWERTY keyboard when writing emails."	1
"I love this phone! It is fast and has plenty of storage.The battery life is great,so i don't need to carry a powerbank around.If anyone is looking for a good phone look at this phone.You will be surprised at how good it is."	1
I love this phone! It&apos;s great. :)) It is in excellent condition. It functions great. The seller had it shipped very quickly.	1
"I love this phone! Upgraded from an iPhone 3G and it made a world of difference! SO much faster! Beautiful, clear display. Nice design. I love the new gyroscope that adds more functionality and fun to apps and games. So glad I got this phone!"	1
I love this phone!!	1
"I LOVE this phone!!!  I only wish the batery life was a little better..  It generally gets me through the day, but ocasionally runs out of juice before the end of the day under heavier use.  I&apos;m also just a little dissapointed that it has no MSD card slot, although the internal memory has been more than suficient so far."	1
I love this phone!!!!	1
"I love this phone, and the seller did a great jod at the descriptiong because everything he said about it is true. Hope every seller on Ebay were like him, Thanks ..."	1
"I love this phone, everything as described, I will recommend this seller."	1
"I love this phone, I had it for a long time and never gave me any problems at all! Hope Nokia keeps making phone like these."	1
"I love this phone, I wanted something that was in the 4.7 range because I have a physical job and larger phones got in my way , this is perfect,  I also wanted a more durable phone made from something besides plastic I love the metal frame. "	1
"I love this phone, it's definitely a must have for someone on a budget, or for one that doesn't need all the extra bells and whistles when it comes to purchasing a cellphone. The battery life is excellent, sometimes only charging mine every other day. The graphics are good, and the games play very well also. I upgraded to this phone from the E4 and I think both perform almost the same, even though this ""Plus"" version has more RAM memory. Overall, it's a great phone and I have recommended it to many friends & family and they have been very pleased as well. You won't regret it, unless you are one in need of the top-notch phones. I recently upgraded to the Moto G5s Plus and paid nearly 4 times the amount I paid for the E4 Plus.. it wasn't worth it considering almost everything the G5s Plus does for me, the Moto E4 and E4 Plus is performing almost just as good as the G5s Plus. "	1
"I love this phone, you can get a lot of apps, it is light and beautiful. if you don&apos;t have internet service you have the WIFI opption to connect almost every where..  Excelent phone"	1
"I love this phone.  I had my old one for six years and finally broke it when it  fell out of my moving car!  It works great, the flashlight is fantastic and I use it constantly.  The schedule, alarm are great too.  The camera - eh, but for  a basic phone it can&apos;t be beat.  I&apos;m getting another one!"	1
I love this phone.  I&apos;ve bought it 3 times now (it was stolen twice before).  It shipped faster than expected and was in perfect condition.  My phone even arrived with an extra battery.  I have absolutely no complaints about the phone or the sellers.	1
I love this phone.  It has the same feature as a more expensive phone I wanted.  I am happy with the purchase of the Motorola I856 Boost MObile phone.  I would reccomend this phone to others.	1
I love this phone.  Ive been trying to get another one to replace my old one.  If it werent for the hinge finally giving out it would still work perfect. Its the easiest phone to use and the menus arent all stupid	1
I love this phone.  You can upgrade ROMS with ease.  Very user friendly.  Fast.  High quality!  Love the Sony Ericsson products and wanted a phone with a full keyboard.  This is definitely the best qwerty keyboard I have ever used!  Way better than iphone.	1
I love this phone. Awesome storage space. Very fast.	1
I love this phone. Great phone it has more than my other phone did I would recomend you to every one. thank you	1
I love this phone. I bought it to use on my old prepay Alltel plan which is now a part of Verizon. Just tried to activate it and Verizon is trying to get me to fully switch because of that STUPID!!! Data package. I REFUSE! To those of you who are dealing with the Alltel takeover or just want a nicer phone on the prepay plan BEWARE!!! They also told me that I would have to go and buy a prepay phone from Wal-Mart (Don&apos;t nobody want that!) When Alltel was Alltel at least we had the option to choose from decent looking phones.	1
"I love this phone. I do not need to see a million screens before I press a button. I do need to worry about dropping it, like a smart phone. I have internet at home, so I don&apos;t need to have it on my phone. I like that it has buttons and it is easy to put contact information. So much more..."	1
I love this phone. I have needed a T-Mobile phone to replace mine and when I ordered this one I didn&apos;t expect it to be like brand new but it was. I am very happy with it. It works great. I look forward to buying more from this seller. I recommend this seller very highly. This seller has super service and prices. Thank you and God bless y&apos;all.	1
"I love this phone. Internet is pretty fast, videos and graphics are great and neat. It is easy to manage. It is not heavy and not too big. I love it. Battery lasts all day but you definitively have to charge it at the end of the day. Oh, the navegation system is also awesome."	1
I love this phone. It has so many featured!!	1
I love this phone. It really is attached to my hip everyday. This is the third phone same brand I bought its perfect for everything I need. thank you	1
"I love this phone. It&apos;s tough and no-nonsense. Tiny, skinny phones are a breakable nuisance.  I love this phone&apos;s big, tactile QWERTY keyboard, the text message button, the alarm button, and the customizable display options. The camera is good and the display is too.  I dislike slidey phones and distrust touch screens. The Casio GzOne Brigade is the perfect flip/clamshell full-keyboard behemoth for the hard-at-work fat-fingered texter."	1
I love this phone. It's my needful driving. 	1
"I love this phone. The large buttons on the keyboard are great. And the interchangeable wallpapers for both outside and inside are great. I decided to buyt this phone because the Palm Treo 600 doesn&apos;t work on my plan, so I decided on this one and what a great choice I made. I have NEVER liked a phone as much as I like this one. Buy one! They are great (:"	1
I love this phone. Very efficient. I am very happy with this phone.	1
I love this phone... 100% operational its just like new... the seller gave direct and precise detail of phone and i am 100% satisfied with it..     thanks	1
I love this phone.....sometimes it does freeze but other than that it's great  	1
I love this phone..What a great upgrade for me.  I really appreciated all the info the seller had posted to the site to help me understand EXACTLY what I needed to know about buying this phone.	1
I love this product. It has more features than i thought it had and works well. I would definitely buy another.	1
"I love this seller. They have sold me my lovely phone just as they told me and it came during the time it was supposed to. 100% recommend. If something unexpected showed up with the phone, they make sure to give you the best deal. You get what you pay for! :):):):)"	1
"I love to be able to use the touch screen, but then for my detailed emails i just slide the phone up and i have a full keyboard. Its everything you loved about blackberry and more. New operating system, Blackberry 6 is simple to use and quite easy once to play around with it. Very easy browser surfing and emailing is a breeze! Well worth whatever dollar value you paid, just remember to check with your local cell phone company as this phone only sells for 609.99 at most cell provider stores, so paying over this is just stupid!     Enjoy!"	1
"I LOVE TO TEXT, I CHECK MY E-BAY SITE ON IT. I KEEP IN CONTACT WITH THE PEOPLE I LOVE. I LOVE TO DOWNLOAD MUSIC. I BOUGHT IT FOR TWO REASONS. ONE MY MOM, AND THE OTHER TO CHECK ON MY E-BAY SITE."	1
i love virgin mobile phones and this is a good phone by samsung	1

I loved everything it was great the phone was perfect and the price was the best on ebay. thanks again	1
"I loved it very easy to use.  it has everything, unlocked, works perfectly.  the speed internet connection is very fast."	1
I loved my sony ericsson because it has every feature that you could need on a phone... i never doubted a moment that i would ever find a phone any better.  This is for sure the best phone i have ever used.	1
I loved the customer service I have received from you guys. Thanks for all you have done for me. Thanks againe	1
"i loved the item that he sent. it was better than he described it, looks brand new. everything works perfect only thing was that phone was locked and only had one try left, but i fixed that for free."	1
I loved the LG EnV 3 and when that ended I got the EnV touch. The EnV touch is a great phone and runs even faster then the old one. Its bigger so typing on the keyboard is a breeze. I love this phone.	1
"I loved the phone even though it was older, but it didn&apos;t even last a month. So i was not happy about that."	0
"I loved the phone I think it was great.  Unfortunately it is not being used because it locks the sim card when it is powered off.  This causes the sim card to burn out. I had to repalce the sim card and the phone.  I would love to retuen the phone but I was told that I would have to pay a restock fee and shipping.  The business hours are only odd because its west coast (mon-fri). This has made it difficult for me to resolve this issue.  I would love to return the phone and get another Tmobilephone that is I would not hav ethese issues with but Im afraid that it is gonna cost me more than its worth.  $129 was already spent.  They do not guarnatee the phone to work.  So overall, DISLIKE because of the situation."	0
"I loved the phone! (it is practically new!) , the phone works well and is cosmetically as described! shipping was also prompt and hastle free, I will definitely buy from this seller again."	1
I loved the S500i. It looks classy and sophisticated.  I owned some sony&apos;s  made and very satisfied with their qualities.	1
I loved the unit except it won't accept sim cards. Merchant was very gracious in refunding me!	0
"I loved the way it looked on the site and even after the box was delivered. I came home to look at it, and found out that it&apos;s made of simple fragile plastic. I bought this phone to replace mine which I bought in the US and it&apos;s the same model and everything except MY phone is way stronger and made of REAL parts. the one I bought was not like that. Thank g-d!!! I got my money back. Never buying from Hong Kong again!"	0
I loved this phone but recently switched to the s9. This ones almost just as nice.	1
I loved this phone I tollay like it it is asy to use and very light i would get anothor one. Thank you for this item excellent. :D :D :D	1
"I loved this phone- while it worked.  I bought it new, in the sealed box.  The slider mechanism broke after 2 1/2 days and when I contacted Samsung about the warranty I was told that the slider mechanism wasn&apos;t covered under the warranty and it would cost $70 to have it repaired, which was more than I paid for the phone.  I have always owned Samsung phones, but never again.  I lost my money."	0
I lvoe the LG Dare.  It is very easy to use and I especially like that I can lock it so I don&apos;t make calls accidentally.	1
"I made a mistake I meant to order a post paid or plan phone, but it was my mistake.  I received the phone fast and it is a nice phone."	1
"I made myself try to like this thing.  I really did. After a month I can take no more ! Back to iPhone I go! Mind you, I left iPhone because my iPhone 7 went into activation lock whilst I was abroad and Apple really did nothing to help me. Upon returning stateside I bought the Samsung. My husband said he had checked out his co workers and it was really nice, fast and he thought Id like it. He was so wrong! I promised Id give it a month to grow on me. It didnt . I was literally counting the days to get rid of it.  Bixby is Siris inbred retarded cousin. Absolutely worthless.  Oh and lets not forget this thing throws itself into safe mode! You get instructions how to get it out of safe mode and you have to do it over and over to the point you are afraid to periodically reboot the phone in fear it will put itself in safe mode AGAIN.  Pop up ads since net neutrality is gone are beyond insane.  Sellers claim they cant stop them. I have no pop ups on my iPhone! If you work in business and are trying to have a conference call, guess what! You get pop ups during your call that can be loud and annoying. What good is video conferencing if you have stupid ads being a nuisance! My son wants a new phone because he is college bound. Right now he has an iPhone 6 with a cracked screen. I"	0
"I made this purchase thinking I could just switch my SIM card.  Seller  stated:  ""Will only work with Sprint and Sprint MVNOs such as Boost Mobile, Tello, textnow, ting... SATISFACTION GUARANTEED. Fast shipping""  Sprint will not activate this phone.  They tell me the serial no. Is not part of their network....  Check serial number with your provider and IME before buying a used phone on eBay!!!"	0
I may have ran into the China Syndrome ....  this phone is a possible knock-off ... instead of saying At&amp;T it says Cingular... we have not had Cingular in this area in 5 years....  the same strange tex shows up everyday... a bottle with &quot;@&apos; after it....over and over ...  the good thing I can say is it is a phone..  but   sometimes messages and tex show up hours later  &amp; lately the phone will not ring and I will see a missed call....    I will check to see were the seller is next time and not be excited to see a great price.....    Ya get what you pay for.....    AT&amp;T    &quot;NOT&quot;	0
I messaged the seller about the item and he didnt respond until the bid was over and by that time I had lost!!! Cant be trusted and YOU NEED TO ALWAYS ASK THIS SELLER ABOUT ITEM IN DEPTH AT LEAST SEVERAL DAYS BEFORE!	1

"I mostly use this phone while traveling overseas, works in every Country, with all the different Carriers, never fails, 3 or 4 days in a row without charging, it&apos;s simply awesome.  I have two iPhones: 3 and 4G, Blackberry Torch, and also this little orange baby, that I adore. As a bonus, in case you want to listen music, the speakers are really really good. This is an old times well designed phone. Have to admit, this is my second one, I lost the first one, and that is why I looked it up in Ebay to buy another Orange Sony Ericsson Walkman.  Got it, thank you for that."	1
I need a new phone. But what I got was a phone without a charger and no papers. So you can not get it to work. I just gave a way my money.	0
"I need an Android phone for development, but I use iPhone 5s for daily usage. So I have these specs.    1. Clean Android install.  2. Second hand, as I just use it for development, want to save money.  3. Even for dev, I don&apos;t want major flaws, like shattered screen glass.    This phone is listed as refurbished so there shouldn&apos;t be major problem. But when I received the phone, it was even better! It was just like new phone! The phone and power charger is wrapped carefully. The camera even has plastic film covered as protection. I wasn&apos;t able to find any tiny flaw on the body. Not even a scratch or figure print. I really feel like I spent $260 for a brant new nexus 5!"	1

"I needed a basic phone to replace one that went bad. I had a friend who purchased a similar one, the same brand and he told me he had his for years and it was like the pink bunny, it keeps going and going. When I saw this one at a fixed price for under $20 including shipping, I purchased it and it has worked fine for the last two months. I just purchased an additional one at the same price to keep as a reserve . This was a very good deal."	1
i needed a cell phone for my granny and it was perfect solution by the price and everything else  thanks	1
"I needed a cell phone that did not have a camera to use for work.  The new phones available through my carrier all had cameras or were Blackberrys.  My husband (a frequent ebay user) suggested I try ebay.  I paid a bit more than I wanted (almost as much as the latest version), but am happy with my purchase.  the seller shipped promptly and the phone works well.  Thank you for you inquiry."	1
I needed a dual SIM phone and this one was advertised as dual SIM. It is not dual SIM. I had it brought overseas and now realize it is not dual SIM. Can I have some money back because this is not what I ordered 	0
"I needed a good phone to replace my old dying one, this phone is brand new and easy to use and has some great features that interact with my PC. i like this phone very much."	1
"I needed a new cell phone and wanted the same phone as the one I had. My carrier told me it would take a while to get one because they were back ordered and I found just what I wanted here and got a super great price.  It was advertised as like new and that is exactly what I got.    It only had a very, very small amount of wear and no marks on the screen. Best of all is that now that my contract has expired with my carrier I have a like new phone and no contract.    Bottom line is I got just what I was shopping for and a great price to boot. Thank you Ebay (and my seller)    Leo Dean  Brunswick, Georgia USA"	1
"I needed a new phone and at first thought I was stumbling on a good deal on a phone I really liked. Might have been, if the seller had shipped it to me. I doubt the phone ever existed, and I might be out seventy-three bucks.   It&apos;s been two weeks since I won and I&apos;ve sent two messages with no response! Don&apos;t be stupid- learn from my mistakes and stop buying from this seller!"	0
"I needed a new phone and I wanted this phone. i LOVE this phone. the ONLY problem i have with this phone is the buttons are like almost really annoying to text with. But, I figure I&apos;ll get used to it. Everything else is excellent. Love the camera, love the graphics. love this phone."	1
"I needed a new phone because my old one was, simply put, a terrible investment on my part, thus I went to something more mainstream and reliable. So far, I&apos;ve had the phone for almost a week. This is a solid piece of machinery. Android 4.0 ICS (Ice Cream Sandwich) is streamlined and smooth and navigating the OS is a breeze compared to the Android 2.1 on my old phone. The AMOLED screen is beautiful, crystal-clear and sharp. The 16 GB internal storage is fantastic! No longer do I have to worry about overburdening my phone&apos;s internal storage with apps or videos, unlike my old phone. The features I love the most: The camera, despite it being a 5 MP. Takes beautiful panorama shots and is very easy to use. Also, the touch screen is very responsive, sometimes a bit too responsive but it&apos;s not something I would complain about.       So far, I haven&apos;t had any problems. Did have a slight glitch while I was talking to my girl: the phone completely reset. I&apos;m hoping that&apos;s a one-time thing.       In the end, this phone is a keeper. Samsung makes good quality phones in my opinion. If I need an upgrade, I will definitely keep Samsung in mind, in comparison to other phone brands."	1
"I needed a new phone but wasn&apos;t up for renewal with Verizon.  I had seen the Cassio in the store and really wanted it.  Glad to get a reasonable price on this phone through Eban and this seller.  Shipped very quickly, and the phone was as described.  Barely any wear.  Like new.  Happy!"	1
"I needed a new phone, but I sold the old and dirty under the guise of the new. And so in general, this model is a relic and the road only for fans."	0
i needed a new phone. I love everything about it besides the battery life. This phone has everything I need!	1
I needed a phone and this was the right phone for me. I love how it works. It has no diections but I figured it out. Thanks.	1
I needed a phone that was easy to text on and this is it!  It is very easy to figure out set up.  I was able to quickly transfer my service from my other working basic phone without going in to the Verizon store.  The store transferred my contacts easily.  The only drawback is very small keys which I adjusted to by using the side of my thumb .  Very happy with my purchase!	1
I needed a phone very badly and I purchased this one. THe phone&apos;s sim card would not come out of the phone at all. Now I have to wait to get another phone.	0
I needed a replacement for my work phone that wasn&amp;apos;t big and bulky. This flip phone was perfect. It is small and functional with no defects. And the price was a steal.	1
"I needed a replacement phone for my daughter who is on my family plan and this was exactly what she needed. She doesn&apos;t do alot of texting, internet or any of the other fancy things that mobile services offer. She said this phone has good sound quality when she talks on it and she hears the other person clearly. It&apos;s perfect for calling the schools to let them know if she&apos;s running late to pick her kids up after school. It&apos;s a very plain but nice functional phone and a great price."	1
"I needed a replacement so I see this phone saying it is a Verizon but unlocked and will work perfectly on the AT&amp;T network.  Well do not get a Unlocked phone from any other carrier and stick to your own.  The phone would only load up in a Verizon format, 3G is the signal and I have 4G LTE, also data will not work at all.  Avoid this phone.  Sent back and received a full refund."	0
"i needed a t mobile phone, saw this one w/ everything i needed, thats what i loved. i hate the fact that the phone was scrathed on front screen so bad that u can hardly see the screen."	0
"I needed an att&amp;t wireless phone at a reasonable price.  I got this one but the phone sucks. The phone has a mind of its own.  The sim card data appears sometimes and sometimes it disappears and the phonebook data only works. It switches to SOS mode (what ever this means) and you have to put the correct code in to use the phone. You can&apos;t put a caller on hold, to answer another call. You will loose the call and person on hold. The reception on this phone is terrible vs. other brand name phones I&apos;ve used. Almost everytime my husband calls me, he gets my voice mail."	0
"I needed another phone and saw the ZTE on sale. On 4G network 96% of the time. Fast downloads, The front camera (that I didn&apos;t know it had) is superb. It also has the BEAM feature that the Galaxy S3 has, which is a plus. All for $36.24, It was a steal and good investment."	1
"I needed something for my son which had few gimmicks, was a good reliable phone,reasonable battery life, was inexpensive and as he is fifteen, had the ability to bounce.  This ticked all the boxes and is still doing so. Well done Ebay"	1
"I needed this item by no later than the estimated delivery date, which I expressed to the seller and they got me the product three days early! No fuss, no extra charge. They are very up front about product condition and I am pleased with what I recieved. I have npt fully set up the device, but so far functionality and cosmetic condition are as expected. "	1
"I needed this phone as a second option and became a first option when I traveled to Africa last November, totally unlocked and perfect connection"	1
I needed to get a new phone because my phone was getting old and it was breaking. I&apos;m very happy with it so far	1
"I needed to replace my flip phone, the screen stopped working. I did not want to get stuck into a new 2 year contract getting it from my service provider. I loved that it was a flip phone, an LG and no 2 year contract. I liked that it came with the battery &amp; charger, in fact 2 batteries were sent.It was in better condition than I expected it to be in. The description said good but I consider it excellent.Love it."	1
I needed to upgrade the wifes phone only I don&apos;t need the rest of the extras they give you when you get a phone plus with all the discount and rebates you get it can&apos;t even touch this price wwooww it will make a great chritmas gift. THANK YOU.	1

"I never received this product. I am frustrated by it. How could e-bay have people commiting fraud and not doing anything about it? My mistake was not to read the feed back on the person selling the phone. Apparentlt whenever he did not get enough money, he will not sell the item and then return the money. As far as paypal they were just happy to get the money and return it. A total waste of time and honesty. Don&apos;t you see that he is doing this type of bussiness? It would be nice if you investigate and get him out of bay, so he will not cause further problems."	0

"I notified the seller not to ship the item. I discovered that the seller misrepresented the item description and was withholding crucial information about the item.  A mobile phone is in one of two states: locked or unlocked. From the item description the seller gives the impression that is unlocked, hiding deliberately the information that is locked. When I am shopping at reputable shop this info presented outright. In this country there are 4 major carries: AT&T, Sprint, T Mobile and Verizon. These are recognizable mobile services trademarks. The word Straight Talk doesnt mean anything to me. Could, be Good Talk, Right Now etc, common phrases put before Apple IPhone. Ive asked the seller what does it means Straight Talk and he replayed Is a company. Very evasive and prove that he is unwilling to do a full disclosure even when it is asked directly.  If a mobile phone comes with a prepaid card does not means that is locked. With an unlocked phone one can use any prepaid card. So the term Straight Talk Apple iPhone 5S 16GB 4G White/Silver LTE Prepaid Smartphone only suggest that one can talk straight away with an Apple IPhone 5S 16GB with a prepaid card. The seller does not disclose that the phone is locked with so called Straight Talk company. When I did this disc"	0

"I only use this phone for the wifi, android, music and camera, not for making or receiving calls. For that, it works well. I like the compact size. The videos are to my liking as I mount it on my bicycle when riding. Much less expensive than a GoPro and the colors are quite good. The 32GB sd card installed allows for storage of lots of pictures and videos which can be easily transferred to PC. If taking videos make sure battery is fully charged especially if taking a video for any length of time. Highly recommend this device."	1
"I opened a return request becaue I did not find a way to contact the seller, I purchased this Item with a confuse description, It said note I and Note II, I coould not make an agreement with the seller because I could not return the item because I am outside of the USA, I live in Dominican republic, since this seller made a mistake on a part the description, I wanted a part refund, the seller did not agree, so I lost many money on this.

I ordered my phone through Pacific-sales. After I had it activated n switch over my number it stopped working the same day it keeps shutting down n won't turn back on I had to keep it plugged in to turn it on even after doing so it wouldn't stay on I had to borrow my neighbors phone to call back Verizon to switch it back luckily my old phone was still in working condition. I had to open a case with eBay bcaz the seller was ignoring me I sent the phone back. It's been 2 days now since the seller received the phone and have not yet issue my refund and according to eBay's policy the seller have 6days up on arrival of the phone to give the refund. Please do not buy from Pacific-sales unless u had better experience with them. 	0

I ordered the sonyericsson c901 from Golden Dupplier.com. When I recieve it the phone does not work properly. The key of the phone does not light. There&apos;s only the blue light ob some button on camera mode. The problem will happen when I use the phone in the dark place. The golden supplier didn&apos;t show any thing to be responsible for this damage phone. I had the phone checked at the Sonyercisson Service center in Thailand and they couldn&apos;t solve this problem. Some shops in ebay lack of responsibility to the customers. I paid 238US$ for this damage phone! Who can help?	0

"I ordered this phone a couple weeks ago, it is one of the cheapest phone with very decent hardware specs. The only downside is the storage capacity but since I don&apos;t store music or videos on my phone, it is more than enough for me.    So far, is the BEST phone I ever had, I&apos;m impressed everyday about the integration of my contacts and how easy it is to do everything. From the regular contact page of the phone, it integrates with all your emails accounts information (MSN, Gmail and Outlook), your facebook profiles including pictures and activities and your LinkedIn profiles. You cannot find a better way to have everything under a single contact page."	1
"I ordered this phone and after using it for about 3 days I began to notice that people who called me would say that they could hardly hear me. I really wanted all of the features the phone offers to work but that was not the case. The most noticeable factor I noticed was that the battery life only lasts for about 5 or 6 hours and the battery drains very rapidly. I feel  that the quality of the battery is very poor compared to several other cell phones Ive had over the years. I went on line and went to many cell phone stores and they all told me that the battery cant be found anymore ,they dont carry it and if it could,  they would have to charge me about what I paid for the cell phone if not more. I need my cell phone as I am handicaped in case of an emergency but I need a dependable one with family mobile that I can afford and I had hoped this was my answer to my prayers. Now maybe it is just this one phone that you sent me that is flawed, I don't know but would be open to another one being sent if need be."	0
I ordered this phone and never received it. I send emails to the seller and never responded. Im still waiting for a response	0

I ordered this phone for a friend and so far so good!	1
"I ordered this phone for my sister. It took a litter longer than I expected for the phone to arrive, however, I realized it was coming from China. I purchase this phone for my sister who is in the island and they only use unlocked cell phone. I was very impressed with the color, more beautiful than I expected and since my sister love pink it was perfect. Everything was in the box and it was packed very well. I had to purchase another phone, but I was waiting until I receive this order to see what it was like befor I purchase another. I am very happy with this purchase and I am getting ready to purchase about two more unlocked cell phones. I have ordered other phones from other sites and was very unhappy with the service. Ebay will be the only site that I will be ordering my unlocked cell phone from now on. Keep up the good work and thanks again."	1
I ordered this phone for work as I cannot have a camera phone. The phone was in much better shape than I expected and works great. No problems at all. Like new	1
"I ordered this phone to replace one just like it that I have finally worn out.  I love this phone!  It is easy to use, the battery lasts a long time, it takes great pictures, and it has a nice slim size, unlike many of the newer smart phones.  I reccomend this phone."	1
"I ordered this phone, and it was not capable of being hooked up to the Verizon Network as advertised as it was faulty.  I Emailed, got a response, was told to return it for a refund.  I returned it as instructed, and have never had the refund credited to my Pay Pal Acount...I am not happy!"	0
I ordered this phone. And I never received it. I contact the seller and the seller didn't seem to do much to help me out. I went to the post office. I told the seller every step that I took to make the situation better and he said nothing he can do about it. Never again.  	0
I ORDERED THIS PRODUCT. BUT I DID NOT GET IT. I GOT A JAPANEESE VERTION OF LG. MODEL NO LGL22. WHICH IS NOT THE IDENTICAL AT ALL. NOT IN SIZE NOT THE LOOK. AND WHAT IS WORSE IT IS NOT SUPPORTED BY LG LABS OUT OF JAPPAN. THAT IS APPART FROM SHIPPING ERORRS (SHIPPING DOCUMENTS WITH FALSE PRICING) WHICH COST ME A LOT OF FINE CHARGES AND WASTE OF VALUABLE TIME. EBAY DID REFUND ME FOR THE ORIGINAL COST. BUT THE FIN AND PENALTY I STILL HAD TO PAY. AND I&apos;M LEFT WITH A SMARTPHONE WITH NO WARRANTY AND NO SUPPORT	0
"I ordered two altell phones from this company and neither of them were usable. The stock photo was a picture of a new phone, what I recieved was 2 phones that were so deeply scratched, and 1 that would not even latch in the back. I have been so disappointed in this transaction that it has kept me awake trying to get my money back and never see or hear from this company again.This is the worst transaction I&apos;ve ever encountered. I suggest anyone who orders from this company ask for a true photo and not a stock, it is a scam and what they put you through to get your money back is a joke.Bad service, it took me 3 days to get them to answer their phones so I could discuss this with them and they were not even concerned in the fact I was upset. Why should they, they had my money. Just beware because I can prove all I say."	0
I ordered two phones supposedly unlocked for T-Mobile MetroPCS. It took several days longer to get the product I was refunded on shipping. One of the phones would not work with MetroPCS so I had to send it back and apparently its on its way back now but who knows if itll work. This one that does work has a really crappy battery so Im gonna have to buy a new battery for it I will not buy from this company again	0
I ordered your Galaxy Mega 5.8 I9150 8GB Unlocked Mobile Phone -But you sold me this phone made from China.  You are a fraudulent. You replace the touch screen but can not be used. You are not seller well.I want you answer why you did do that? Thanks.	0
I originally bidded on it because of the features it had. Seller says it works but I have no proof of it working.	0
"I originally got this entry level Android phone as a placeholder for a BlackBerry KEYOne.  Once I got the J3, it performed well for the basic tasks I used it compared with my LG V20.  The J3 holds its own as a daily driver for lots less than the bling of its S7 Edge sibling.  The J3's biggest problem is the mediocre camera.  So long as the user has no need for gaming or using a great camera, then the J3 should be good for most users.  For a ""temporary"" Android phone or one for a kid, then the J3 is for you.  Keep in mind that any Android phone is probably good for up to two years anyway because it'll no longer receive software or security updates at that time."	1
"I originally had this phone from a friend in a below average condition.  I was okay with the phone until I broke it. Upon returning it to the Sprint store, they wanted to charge me way too much for a new one. I found this phone on ebay and was very critical; it looked too good to be true. It was only $50 with a memory card. I decided to go ahead and buy it. I was extremely satisfied. The product was as good as new. There was a minor scratch on the phone that the seller informed me about. This scratch was virtually nonexistent; I wouldn&apos;t have noticed it if it wasn&apos;t brought to my attention.  I highly recommend doing business with this seller. Everything was more than satisfactory."	1
"I owed 2 of these     they are  slow, locks up constantly  and lacks memory  worst  phones i ever owned"	0

I owned a Motorola W490 flip phone that stopped working.  I ordered a new W490 from this seller.  I was sent a used phone and the wrong model.  I did not use the phone at all.  I requested a refund that had to be escalated to Ebay rather than dealing directly with the seller.	0
"I owned one of these phones and it was more than likely the most reliable phone I have ever owned, even topping my iPhone. I just recently purchased the i776w for the wife and she is just in love with it. It has everything you need and nothing you don&apos;t. The bluetooth is awesome and external display is incredibly rugged and durable as well as the internal peripherals. Absolutely wonderful little phone, hands down! You most DEFINITELY get the bang for your buck with this one!"	1
I owned this phone before my smart phone (2010) and it was a great phone then. It arrived in brand new condition as advertised. Shipping was fast.  It is being used as incentive for my teenaged daughter to behave! Its working very very well :) 	1
I paid $ 575 for the phone which died just after one month and because 30 days have passed I have no cover from ebay. Such a waste of money and time .	0

I paid for faster shipping and it was still sent on economy. This is very frustrating and disappointing when I paid extra to get it faster and have to wait! This seller tried to trick me into paying more money for the phone that I bid on fair and square. Disappointing!	0

"I paid for the expedited shipping and seller got it to me on Saturday like he stated he would. iPhone X was in mint condition. Description stated it was used that the box had just been opened, and that seem to be true. The iPhone X actually didnt seem to be used at all I was surprised because others have stated brand new just open box and Ive gotten item that seemed maybe like it was used. But that wasnt the case here. Good seller fast response and fair price. Thanks !!!! "	1

"I personally love this phone. Decent size, not too big or small. Great internal memory and RAM to run multiple programs at once. The only slight downfall is the long charging and short battery life when you play a lot of games. However, the one downfall isn't enough for me to give it a lower mark."	1
I phone 7 sprint is the carrier only used for 3 months still has manufacturers warranty till feb 2018 	1
I placed an order on 4/24/19.... seller shipped the phone to wrong address and claimed he received an email from me directed him to ship to that wrong address... which was not true.  The wrong shipment took 12 days to delivered which was 5 days later than promised.  I have talked with the seller asking for the money back.  The whole experience was terrible... it was a wasted of time and now I have to scramble looking for another phone for my son.... I rated this seller below average.	0
I plugged the phone in and it wont even get past the apple sign. It just sits there flashing. This is a Christmas present that I dont have the time to return and wait for another one. I am SO disappointed in this. This is supposed to be a NEW phone. 	0

"I previously had a Nokia 6133, and was expecting the same quality phone.  The 2720 is awkward to open, and just feels wrong.  I want to open it up backwards because of the odd feel.  Several other people tell me the same thing with this model.  It also does&apos;t have a push button to pop it open when answering a call and is a clumsy two handed procedure.  The 2720 will take pictures, but has no way to put them on the computer other than to download them.  This takes forever, and I have only figured out how to do one at a time, and they have to be less than 100K.  With a 1.3 meg camera, this doesn&apos;t work too well.  There are no memory chips.  The 6133 had a socket for a memory chip, and I could download 100 or more pictures in a few minutes.  I ordered parts and a tool to repair my old 6133 and can&apos;t wait to get it working again.  Even the 6133 is not waterproof."	0
"I previously owned this product, but it was stolen, and wanted to get it again now that the mobile tv service had finally come to my coverage area.  However, the call quality was not very good, my spouse said she couldn&apos;t hear me very well on her end and many times my end would drop in and out of reception.  I loved the form factor, the unique swivel screen to view in landscape mode for the tv, but since this is indeed a phone first it was unacceptable for me because of the poor call quality.  I always loved LG products and thought they were they best on the Verizon network, but maybe because this was a refurbished phone, it must have been damaged previously.  I returned it for a refund."	0
"I purchase 2 phones ,but one of them was use, and it has a lot of scratches , not cool at all!!!"	0

"I Purchased 3 i68phones on ebay. I bought them out right, not auction. None of the three did not work. I found that when I sent on of them back I still was going to lose my money. I wanted to exchange phone. I kept waiting for a response since March. I finally got an email that I would be credited about half of the price, $25.00 went to restock fees. I didn&apos;t want a refund, I wanted a phone that would work."	0
"I purchased 3 Sidekicks and had to send 2 of them back, I purchased them because the price was excellent and my daughter and her friends wanted one. They seem to be very delicate, but, I was not pleased with the sidekicks at all. I hope they figure out what&apos;s going wrong with them."	0
"I purchased a factory refurbished Motorola Q phone and am pretty disappointed in it.  The cost from the e bay dealer was low ($65), and the dealer was excellent, but if it were not for the low cost factor, I would have felt ripped off.  The dealer happily replaced the phone with another Motorola Q when I reported that the battery life was very poor.  He sent out another unit, but it is the same problem.     The longest talk time you can expect from a Q is around 40-50 minutes, and that is without any extraneous activities like taking pictures, web browsing, texting, etc.  If you use any functions other than talking, you can see battery life drop to a 25-35 minutes.  I have not used the Cricket broad band service before having it on this phone, but I can tell you that it is a joke.   If you are planning to surf the web using Cricket broad band, forget it.  It is essentially worthless, and even thought it adds only about 6 bucks to your monthly bill, it is not worth even that.  The Motorola Q is thin, attractive, and cool looking, but I would not recommend it, unless you do like I did, and buy a factory refurbished unit for as cheap as you can get it, which is available for $60-75.  At that price, it&apos;s not a bad phone, and better than other new phones with fewer features.  Just don&apos;t pay the new list price of around $200.  You can do better for those dollars."	0

I purchased a IPhone 6 plus for my daughter.   When I received it it froze during set up several times.  It continued to freeze the next day so I contacted the seller and told him what was going on and initiated a return.  When the buyer received the phone back he accused me of damaging the screen as it was slightly lifted and would only refund me 50%.  I sent him screen shots from his auction stating the screen was lifted as well as a screen shot of his picture of the lifted screen.   He then escalated it to eBay who found in his favor....  until I contacted eBay via phone and told them what exactly was going on.  After 30 minutes on the phone and research on their part Ebay reversed their decision and refunded me the whole amount!  Use caution when buying from this seller!!	0
"i purchased a motorola phone, Now the phone is good but the battery is bubbled up and old. it cant even fit into my phone without the back piece wanting to come off, This is not fair i paid my money so my products should be useable. This is my first time on ebay and i already regret it. I should not have to buy a brand new battery when i already paid you guys...CONTACT ME ASAP OR I WILL REPORT THIS TO SOMEONE HIGHER!!!!!!!"	0
"I purchased a Nokia E66. It was shipped late, once I received it, the battery was missing. The seller tells me that the battery was not in stock by his supplier. Promised two ship it in two weeks.

I purchased a phone from a different website.  They say the phone had a 16G internal memory.  It only had a 8G internal memory and the phone took such a long time to charge and battery use is terrible.  Well I seen this phone in the store and also here in ebay.  So I purchased it and so happy I got this phone.  It is worth the investment.  To the seller thanks for having this amazing product . LOVE IT	1
"I purchased a phone in ""excellent"" condition. I received a phone that doesn't hold a charge for more than a few hours (I have to charge it 3x a day) & the camera makes an audible mechanical sound every time I open the camera app & struggles to focus for photos. I emailed for an exchange but they never got back to me. What a rip off! "	0
"I purchased a so called new phone that was shipped to me on time but the thing is definitely not new. I charged the phone, set up the phone for my mom in about 15 min and the phone was so hot I could barely touch it! Noticed a small marking on the back case and realized this was not new. The phone was then shut off so it could cool off. When I turned it back on the next day the Samsung sign showed up when I turned it on and then the screen was black? It doesn't work! After trying to get a return initiated with the seller which at first said free returns I had no luck. I contacted pay pal and got things moving but then looked back at the listing and it says seller pays return shipping and there is a 20% restocking fee? Total bologna! scam!! Stay clear of these products!!"	0
"I purchased a Verizon Samsung VX6100 from this seller. When I received it, I discovered that the majority of the number keys did not work. They had to be pressed repeatedly in order to work. And worst of all, the SEND button had to be depressed about 15 times before it would work. I immediately sent the phone back for an exchange and received a replacement phone within a few days. The second phone worked great for about three days and after charging all night (with the included charger), it went completely dead and would not even turn on. I visited a local Verizon dealer and was told the battery was bad and it would have to be replaced. The cheapest one was $55.00! No thanks. I ended up switching back to my original phone and will deal with the issues I have had with it to begin with. I will not be doing business with www.valuecells.com ever again!"	0
"I purchased an EVo from this seller. The Sprint EVO was brand new as described, arrived very quickly and I was able to set up the phone in mins. Great sesller, true to description and I would reccomended again to all of my friends. Let me know whae the Sprit Epic is available."	1
"I purchased an iPhone 8 Plus from this seller and it was clearly defective upon receiving the item. The seller was immediately contacted to inform him the phone may look in like it is in ""mint"" condition, but it did not function properly. The iPhone would turn on and turn off on its own, the microphone and speaker would not work if the phone would turn on long enough to attempt a phone call, the phone would freeze up on start up, and the haptic feedback would not work. The seller was requested to provide a refund, but refused to provide a refund without keeping a 20% restocking fee. The seller and I went back and forth as I tried to convince him the iPhone was defective. The seller then told me if the iPhone was defective that I should send it to Apple to be fixed. Apple was contacted and ran a diagnostic on the iPhone and suggested I take the phone to Best Buy is an Apple Authorized Service Provider. After several visits to Best Buy and additional diagnostics, Best Buy agreed there was clearly something wrong with the phone. Best Buy thought either the internal circuitry was tampered with or it had water damage. The seller was updated of this information and immediately accused us of causing water damage and said we were liars. This seller refused to provide a refund of the phon"	0

I purchased it because im changing phone carriers    Works great doesn&apos;t have as much as the 4G HTC     unsure how it compares     This is a Hot item at the Cricket Store his price is A+	1
I purchased it to replace the cell phone that was stolen from me.  I was glad to find the exact phone because I already had all the accessories I needed to use it right away and it was a very good price.  The condition was very good and this buyer is very satisfied with the product.	1
"I purchased one before, which was advertised as new, but wasn't.  It had been out of warrantee since December.  I returned that one and got this one.  It functions perfectly.  I knew it wasn't new and guessed it was out of manufacturer's warrantee, which it was.  But I believed for the price it was worth it.  If it would function properly for the return period, it would continue to function a reasonable of time.  This was less expensive than the first, functions perfectly, arrived in a timely fashion, and is in my opinion a 10 of 10 in appearance.  It is a quality phone and has excellent photo and video quality.  The 32 GB on- board memory is for more more than ample."	1
"I purchased one of the ""New Apple iPhone SE -64GB - Space Gray (Unlocked) A1723 (CDMA +GSM) Applecare"" on May 20th, 2018.  The item came in excellent condition and worked perfectly until Nov, 2018. Now the item often powers off suddenly for no reason, and this can happen several times per day. It does not help to plug it into a power outlet, and it can powers off when it is at 100% battery. The only way to restart it is with a hard restart, and even then the screen is sometimes frozen and it will not start working. Other days it still works fine. I have not damaged the phone in anyway, nor gotten it wet. I have taken good care of it and am very disappointed that it didn't even last for six months. Bottom line, be wary of products from this seller, and buy insurance! "	0
"I purchased samsung galaxy j3 as a x-mas gift, which is  why I contacted seller on the 26th of Dec, I was told its been almost a month since purchased.,waiting to see the outcome.

"I purchased the iPhone 5C in pink. Shipping was fast and free! I was excited until I tried to activate said phone. It's advertised as being in new condition and to be used on the Verizon network. The phone came in scratch and dent free condition. Upon arriving at Verizon and running its IMEI number only to say its not compatible. Decided to go to T-mobile, they added their chip and still not compatible. Tired of running around I called apple directly. After giving them the device's IMEI number I was told the phone is locked under a cellular company by the name of Free France Mobile and would have to contact them to unlock the phone. I opted  to just contact the seller to start the return process. They were very nice and responsive, they even apologized quite a few times. I applaud customer service for being supportive with my return process. "	0
"I purchased the Motorola V120t (Cingular Wireless) cell phone to replace a lost Cingular phone. It was old technology and was unusable. I tried to email the seller and received an error message. I phoned and left a message but did not receive a response. I mailed the cell phone back hoping that would be an indication of my dissatisfaction but have not heard anything. If I ever buy anything on Ebay again, it will be a cold day in July."	0

"I purchased the Note 5 after I had my Note 7 recalled twice and decided that I would give the Note 5 a try. It is a great phone and offers all the advantages of having a Note device. I would recommend only the 64gb version due to the lack of a SD memory card to expand the memory on the Note 5. Battery life is good and will go all day before needing a charge. It is usually at about 30% around 10pm after starting at 7am. It is well built and fits in your hand good and is very easy to use. The wireless fast charge is the Best and once you get used to using it, it will be the only way to charge your phone. It is also very fast, 30% to full charge in less than an hour wireless. To be honest after using the Note 5, I actually like it better than the Note 7, Samsung should upgrade the Note 5 to more memory and this device would be the best of the best. Also it would be good if you could get the 65gb in the other colors, right now it is only available in the Black.. You will not be unhappy with the Note 5 64GB version. "	1

"I purchased the phone at a buy now price, she never contacted me with anything, the money was already applied to my credit card so I had paid for it. A week went by and never heard from her dispite all the emails I had sent her. Finally I contacted paypal and made a dispute, when I messaged her and told her what I was doing, only then did I get a response, she told me she did not care and to go ahead and contact paypal to get my money back. THEN, I get an email today from another person she tried to sell the same phone too and he is going through the same thing. This lady is a horrible ebay seller and I would not trust her with anything. She sold the same phone twice and I am sure she will try it again. BEWARE OF HER!!!"	0
"I purchased the phone for my nephew in Cuba to take to him on my 5 day trip the phone works fine with the exception of the front camera, its stock on mico once you try to focus away it becomes out of focus. I had to leave the phone with him so he can communicate and I don't know when I would be returning to Cuba this is really unfortunate!!!!!   "	0
"I purchased the phone in good faith since I needed an AT&amp;T sevice to replace the phone I broke and I was not eligable for a free phone from AT&amp;T yey.  This phone was not at all what I expected it to be.  The actin on the slide part was sloppy, there were more dings and scratches than I expected and it keeps dropping calls.  I inquired with the seller and was told to try and work with AT&amp;T to correct some of my issues. I have not been plaqued with dropped calls before and rather than spend my time trying to correct this phone I just bought another some where else and resolved my issue myself.  I&apos;ll try and give this phone away on Craig&apos;s list."	0
"I purchased the phone on E-Bay because the phone retails for 2.5x what I paid for it.  It was a used item but without a doubt in very good condition.  The phone has been great, has given me no problems andI am very satisfied with the product, the seller and ultimatelely e-bay for setting up this kind of marketplace."	1
I purchased the phone when it arrive it's  Not working because I'm not In the US it would cost over a 100 US dollars on top of which the seller knew the motherboard was defective now they are saying they cannot send me an motherboard so i offer to purchase the board I'm awaiting a reply however i think unfair but such is life. 	0
"I purchased the product for my mother. Description said it was in great shape, worked perfect, no charger. I get it and after I purchase a charger notices that the battery was swollen and would not charge so I had to purchase another one. Then finally get it to turn on when the volume is stuck on low so you can not hear my mother when you are speaking with her. It will also send the same text over and over again. I have recently purchases another phone from eBay and is waiting for it to be delivered so we can throw the HTC in the TRASH. All together it was terrible eBay experiance and a waste of my money."	0
"i purchased these 3 cell new and non of them work or hold charge, sent an email to seller and never got a response."	0
"I purchased this Alcatel one touch for my mother,she had one and damaged it so I bought her the same one. It's a simple basic cell phone and does everything she needs, talk and txt. "	1
I purchased this as it was advertised as new.  Should have guessed the battery would be old and not take a charge.  Beware and always ask about everything!!!	0
"I PURCHASED THIS CELL PHONE FOR THE FIRST TIME, BUT FOUND OUT AFTER I REPLACED THE OLD BATTERY WITH A BRAND NEW ONE, THAT THE DEFECT IS NOT WITH THE BATTERIES, BUT THE PHONE. THE PHONE DRAINS THE BATTERIES WITHIN 5 HOURS WITHOUT USING THE PHONE.  I PURCHASED THIS PHONE TWICE FROM DIFFERENT SELLERS, BUT THE RESULTS WERE THE SAME.  I DOD NOT LIKE THIS PRODUCT. THE SELLER WAS VERY GOOD IN REFUNDING MY MONEY"	0
"I purchased this cellphone cause it said it would work with Cell One.  But when I received it, it did not.  Then I spoke to the seller about refunding it, and he said to send it back and he would refund my money.  Well as of tomorrow September 1st, it has been a whole month since I mailed it.  I still have not received the refund on it.  So livinintheboonies has the cellphone plus the money I paid.  I would never purchase another item from him, and am afraid to purchase anything from ebay.  That is a lot of money I am out.  Betheny"	0
I purchased this for my 16 year old grandson for Christmas. He is very pleased with it &amp; uses it often.	1
"I purchased this for my mother and after she had it for 2 months, it quit registering the sim card. I replaced the simple card, and still have the same issue. If I restart the phone it will work for a few hours. I purchased her a galaxy note 3, and she has not had any issues. And I'm using the same sim card."	0
"I purchased this iphone 4s for the ipod feature. The charging port fits my Bose docking speaker, one that I purchased several years ago. My previous iphone 4 died and I wanted to replace it so that I could load my music and play it on the speaker. The phone functions beautifully as an ipod and holds a ton of music. This was a refurbished iphone and I was expecting some scratches or other minor blemishes. I was thrilled when I saw the phone is in perfect condition. Not a ding anywhere. I'm very happy with this phone."	1
I purchased this item (not a bid). It took a week for the item to be shipped and almost two weeks to receive. I have never encountered this problem on ebay and was very disappointed with the delay in the sellers timeline to ship the item.	0
I purchased this item and the icloud was locked. So I contacted Apple to see if I could get it icloud unlocked and they said it was a stolen item. Also when I finally received the item the screen was completely shattered. Looking back at my bank records there were other charges that were coming from the same address for small amounts of money. I am completely unsatisfied 	0
"I purchased this item by accident but my request for a refund was met super fast, politely and without quibble or loss of thoughfulness or care. I almost felt like purchasing just out of guilt.  Highly recommended. (If only all vendors were as diligent and so thoughtful)."	1
"I purchased this item it said it had wifi, I though oh that&apos;s nice very affordable price i&apos;ll purchase it. only to find out there is not wifi as the specs. specified. it cost more to return the product. Very disappointing. and to make it worst the sellers doesn&apos;t want to take the blame for it. Ok fine they refunded me after I stick in their ass on a number of occasions $40.00 and we discussed $45.00. Lying. I will not purchase another one and won&apos;t recommend it to anyone. To make it worst I inquired if they&apos;re sure it has wifi, and is whatsapp compatable. They said yes. It freezes, can&apos;t see my memory card."	0
"I purchased this item via best offer, paid for it immediately and never again heard from the seller.  Since I purchased the phone because I have a need for one, this is a terrible outcome.  I&apos;ve used eBay for years and made hundreds of purchases.  This is only the second time I&apos;ve had a problem, but wanted to be sure other buyers are aware it&apos;s dangerous to do business with this seller."	0
"I purchased this phone - Sony Ericsson TM506 - as a replacement for the same model. Although advertised &amp;quot;new in box&amp;quot;, the phone is defective and overheats after a couple hours and totally shuts down.  After the unit cools, it works again for a couple hours before overheating and shutting down.  This has been the cycle since receiving the phone.  I contacted the seller about the problem within a few days of receiving the phone, and his reply was that he wouldn&amp;apos;t do anything about it since he&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;not in the phone business&amp;quot;.  Lucky for him, I wrote his eBay review before I realized the problem and received his unprofessional, &amp;quot;snotty&amp;quot; replies. THIS phone is POOR, but a working TM506 is an EXCELLENT phone."	0
"i purchased this phone a few weeks ago, and overall, this is a very great phone for all its features.  i switched over from a HTC Evo 3D, and the only big issue i had was the android keyboard.  the space bar is slightly smaller, and the phone doesnt know alot of commonly used words in context.  other then that, the phones ease of access is amazing.  the processor on the phone is very quick, and has wifi, 3g, and 4g capability for quick internet browsing.  the camera is a 8.0mega in the back, and shoots some amazing pictures and even does zoomed in close ups with a very fine and precise focus capability.  i was amazed at how fine my pictures came out.   call clarity is everything, and this phone had a crystal clear  sound output and same for the microphone.  never had a dropped call or out of range signal.    the thing i love the most is the ability to tell the phone what to do. as an example- &quot;Hello Galaxy&quot;-prompted the phone i was giving a command.-&quot;navigate me to XXX Chesapeake ave&quot;-the command i gave. the phone promptly responded with &quot;navigating to XXX Chesapeake Ave, Towson MD&quot; and started giving directions.    over all, i will recommend Samsung galaxy phones to people who want a reliable phone that has the ability to do anything."	1
"I purchased this phone all excited and when I tried to activate it...it is a phone from 2001...discontinued...won&apos;t work...i am truely disapointed, and will never buy anything from them again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"	0
"I purchased this phone and made the mistake of misreading the item description. So i opened a return only to find out shortly after that the mistake was mine. so i went to have the phone camera replaced, only to find out that it was water damage that caused the camera to break and its far to expensive to fix water damage to make it worth it. Now the seller wont open another return and i cant get ahold of ebay for the life of me. They hide better then Osama."	0
"I purchased this phone and the listing said it was a backup phone, hardly used. This was listed fraudulently.  Less that a week after receiving the phone and connecting it to my service an internal part stopped working.  I took it to verizon and was told this happens after SEVERAL YEARS of use.  I had insurance fortunately and they replaced my phone with a new one or I would have disputed the whole transaction and returned it."	0
"I purchased this phone and when I recieved it, I noticed many problems with it. For example, there was a beaping noise that would go off in the middle of calls. I also had terrible reception, that would at any instant disconnect. It took me several hours to purchase this phone on Ebay, and then an additional 2 hours on the phone with T-Mobile to connect my phone. I originally had to pay around $15.00 for shipping, and then on top of this I had to pay to ship the phone back from where I purchased it. This is rediculous and I was not pleased. I was disappointed that I would have to pay for shipping the phone back, when clearly it was damaged."	0
"I purchased this phone as a cheap replacement for my last droid, which broke.  I immediately regretted it.  As a previous droid user, this phone was the biggest step back for me.  The .5 GB of internal memory can&apos;t even hold onto the most basic of apps while still storing a handful of texts.  The touchscreen is slow, and the camera is one of the worst I&apos;ve seen on any smartphone.    All that being said, as an inexpensive start-up phone for new droid users, it&apos;s an okay choice.  If you are NOT looking for a sleek, fast, fully featured android, this phone will likely suit you if you want to save a couple hundred dollars."	0
"I purchased this phone as a replacement for my wife,  It got lost in shipping,( I paid for 3 day express), the phone arrived D.O.A., I had to send it back, ( I paid for shipping.I contacted the seller a couple of times and they have yet to contact me... Here it is more than a month later and I am out the phone and shipping. Won&apos;t buy there ever again..."	0
"I purchased this phone because a friend had one and I was extremely impressed with the quality of the pictures taken with the Note 5.  The phone is in excellent condition and works just like new.  I am familiar with the Samsung line, all our phones and tablets are Samsung, so there were no surprises.  The battery life on the Note 5 is not quite as good as the S-5 that my husband has, but it's worth it for the better camera, and it charges super fast!"	1
I purchased this phone because I needed a smart phone so I would have email texting and calling capabilities. really like how thin the phone is and how easy it is to use. there is a lot I dislike about this phone. it could be because it was purchased used but I have issues with the  battery life (only lasts about 3 hours on standby) with the battery saver on. the touch screen sometimes does not work or you have to press harder then usual. and not to mention the earpiece was broken when I received it. I have to use a Bluetooth or put them on speaker. overall I think this is a nice phone if treated right. the camera is amazing theres little to no blur when taking pictures of people or objects moving. I deff recommend the phone. just don&apos;t go through the same people I purchased it from because they refused to fix the earpiece problem when they clearly stated that it was a fully functional phone. and they would not follow the 30 day warranty that was mentioned under item condition.	0
"I purchased this phone because it has much better reception in my home, especially in my basement office.  Our cell reception is poor here because we are in a low valley, even though near towers.  My last 3 cell phones have had the same problem.  While it is out of production it works better than newer cell phones.  I actually have two similar phones for business and personal.  It is easier to hold and open instead of small polished phones.  Smart phones, also do not work well here."	1
"I purchased this phone because it was a gold one for a good price, postage paid by seller. It stopped working after two weeks. It would not stay on even with a new battery. It came as a new phone and not reconditioned in a box, with a manual and accessories. It looked brand new with all the protective plastic protection shields on the phone. It did come with a two language keypad, Arabic and English that was not in the description and I did not like that. I contacted the seller and he was understanding and gave me a complete refund. I was pleased about that, but will not purchase a Razr phone from China again."	0
I purchased this phone because my iphone 3gs was acting weird. This phone was in excellent condition! Shipping was fast and now I have a working phone. Overall this was a great bidding experience.	1
"I purchased this phone because of Sony Ericssons reputation. I am very glad that I did. I made the purchase on eBay and it was a used model. I didn&apos;t receive any instructions with the phone but that is OK. It was pretty easy to figure everything out. There are features on the phone that I personally don&apos;t use ie. Java, Email, Instant Messaging, Blue-tooth and a few more. It also has a set up that allows you to shop for ring tones, backgrounds, and themes. I like the phone because it is small but VERY durable. I have already dropped it a time or two (OK, 4) and it still works well. If you are looking for a con to go with all the pros of this phone, the only thing I can think of is that I can not hear it ring inside my pocketbook. As for easy and durable as well as convenient in size this is the right phone for me."	1
"I purchased this phone expecting it to be better than any older model I have had in the past. I was sadly mistaken to find that the touch screen was faulty and doesn&apos;t register your touch about 80% of the time. It also will not make any sound, so there&apos;s no hope of using the alarm or hearing it ring. The camera and recorder on it are good, but not reason enough to buy the phone. Totally faulty in almost every aspect and all in all a piece of JUNK."	0
"i purchased this phone for my 13 year old son. i knew that it did not come with a charger so i ordered that separately.it wasn&apos;t until i received the charger that i realized that i sent my son on a trip with a phone that could only text to communicate. he can hear what was said, but i could not hear him. i had to spend a week without hearing my son&apos;s voice and only communicating thru text."	0
i PURCHASED THIS PHONE FOR MY DAUGHTER AFTER HER BLACKBERRY CURVE BIT THE DUST!  SHE LOVES IT &amp; WISHED I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN HER THIS PHONE IN THE FIRST PLACE!  IF IT LASTS LONGER THAN 3 MONTHS LIKE THE CURE DID WE BOTH WILL BE HAPPY!	1
"I purchased this phone for my husband and paid for it immediately after winning the item. It is now 9-25 and I still don&apos;t have the item. A few days after winning I noticed that there was not a tracking number on ebay so I emailed the seller, they hadn&apos;t even mailed it off yet. Shouldn&apos;t have to &quot;prompt&quot; sellers to send purchased items to buyers who promptly paid via paypal."	0
"I purchased this phone for my husband to replace the phone he lost that was exact same model. Ad claims phone is &quot;NEW&quot; but we received it loose in a small box, not in original packaging. Phone is obviously used, it only works part of the time &amp; as time has passed since we bought it little over a month ago, it works less &amp; less, loosing signal at any given time. It will not pick up wi-fi signals. I have the exact same phone &amp; have never had any issues with mine nor did my husband till he lost his. If you purchase one of these phones from this seller &amp; it is not in AT&amp;T blister pack when you receive it - RETURN IT!!!"	0
"I purchased this phone for my mom, her first smart phone.  I have used Blackberry for years and thought this would be a great phone for my mom to start out with.  The price was very reasonable and it shipped extremely fast, arriving several days ahead of schedule.  "	1
"I purchased this phone for my son and after just a few months the phone started flickering and shutting off on it own. Then the cheap battery started getting hot and the phone would go crazy. Eventually, the phone started to shut off regularly and now it doesn't even turn on. I contacted the seller and he was no help at all, he said to reset the phone and buy a new battery. If the phone was new the battery should have been new as well. I reset the phone and purchased a new batter but the it doesn't turn on any more. The seller advertised the item as ""NEW"" I believe he is selling ""REMANUFACTURED""  products. This seller doesn't care about his customer's he refused to accept a return for another item. I will never do business with this seller again and i recommend no one does either."	0
"I purchased this phone for my son.  Unfortunately, it does not have GPS capability.  I do not know about other cell phone providers, but mine would not activate the phone.  Therefore the phone is pretty much useless to me."	0
I purchased this phone for my wife. She is not into the computer in your hand telephones.  The Motorola Z3 is a down to earth cell phone with all of the features she did want.  I would definately buy another if the need should arise.	1
"I purchased this phone from Best Buy who were kind enough to refund my money. After using my phone for just a few moments I was in love due to the larger screen and new Android software and especially the reasonable price.  However, within three days the screen goes completely black and phone is frozen and I can't even do a hard reset. ZTE did a terrible job with this phone. This is apparently a common problem according to Google. If your looking for a cheap prepaid phone stick with Samsung!"	0
I purchased this phone from Tracfone. It would not connect to their network. I was sent a replacement phone with the same problem. I was told I couldn't return for a refund because the phone was a replacement for the first one. Beware!!!	0
"I purchased this phone in order to save money for the next several months on my bill by dropping smartphone service yet keeping basic wireless service. This phone works beautifully, and the price paid for it was more than more than double made up for on the first month&apos;s cellular bill.  Well worth the price."	1
I purchased this phone last week and received it within a few days! The phone is in perfect condition. Everything works well except one tiny issue which has me worried. Phone overheats. 	1
"I purchased this phone off eBay, the phone appears to be running sluggish. The phone is unlocked as stated but the Metro PCS logo irritates me and unfortunately, I am unable to uninstall the Metro PCS apps already on the phone. When I input my 4-digit code to unlock the phone, the screen goes blank and takes a long time for my apps to appear on the screen.  "	0
I purchased this phone on eBay and it is probably the best phone that I have ever had.  It is so fast.	1
"I purchased this phone to replace a K1m that I have had for about 3 years that I enjoyed and it fulfilled all my needs. I originally got my phone on the Alltel network that was recently taken over by Verizon. One thing that I didn&apos;t realize until I received my new phone is that the software was completely different and I am still getting used to it. Nothing is where it was on my old phone. One minor problem I ran into was that when I pulled the memory card out of my old phone and put it into the new phone, the pictures and mp3&apos;s I had on the card did not show up on the new phone. I assume that there is a different folder structure on the Verizon software. I just haven&apos;t had time to look into it yet."	1
"I PURCHASED THIS PHONE TO REPLACE MY OLDER MOTOROLA FLIP-PHONE THAT, AFTER 10 YEARS OF PERFECT SERVICE, MET ITS DEMISE BY BOUNCING DOWN A FLIGHT OF BASEMENT STAIRS ONTO A CONCRETE FLOOR.  IT STILL WORKED...ER MOSTLY.  SO i PURCHASED THIS RUGGED VERSION AND, WHILE STILL AS COMPACT WHEN FOLDED AS THE ORIGINAL, SLIPS CONVENIENTLY INTO MY SUIT POCKET. AS A RETIRED ENGINEER, i CAN APPRECIATE THE ""BARRAGE"" RUGGED DESIGN AND MANUFACTURE -- IT IS SO RUGGED THAT i HAVE NO DOUBT IT WILL OUTLAST ME.  ALSO, THE PRICE IS A BARGAIN FOR WHAT YOU GET.  WHEN i MAKE A PHONE CALL  I DON'T WANT TO JAM A SHOE-BOX SIZED PHONE TO MY EAR.  THE ""BARRAGE"" IS, THEREFORE, PERFECT FOR ME, PLUS IT CAN TAKE GREAT PHOTOS.  IF YOU NEED A COMPACT, RUGGED AND RELIABLE PONE, BUY THIS ONE.  IF YOU WANT A TV SET OR MUSIC BOX, LOOK ELSEWHERE.  "	1
"I purchased this phone to replace one just like it that was stolen from me.  I like a simple phone -- I&apos;m one of those probably rare people these days who believes that a phone is for making and receiving calls, and not for doing all kinds of fancy stuff.  This phone fills the bill very well, as far as I&apos;m concerned.  I particularly like it&apos;s long life for each battery charge."	1
I purchased this phone to upgrade from the HTC myTouch because I really like the slide out fully functional key pad. I expected the phone to be similar with that exception but was pleased to find many new ehancements to the phone itself. It works a little different (better) so it takes getting used to again but in a very excellent way.  This phone is faster.. much faster... so I am pleased to have spent a small amount to upgrade to this unit.  Now I have a phone that I am very pleased with...	1
I purchased this phone took me contacting the seller before I got the phone when I did it didn't work I returned the phone and it has been 2 weeks and I still have not seen my money.  Do Not Trust 	0
i purchased this phone you said might work or use as parts but there was nothing you could use as parts i contacted you you said a refund would be issued i sent back the phone have not recieved a refund	0
"I purchased this product because of my initial purchase of the same product about 18 months ago. Initially, I was extremely happy with the Nokia 6555, but the last two I got [including this one] I&apos;m not happy at all with. The one I have now is the one I just purchased from Ebay. It stinks. The battery will not hold a charge. The person I got it from sent two bateries and neither are any good. I&apos;ve decided to hold on to this thing until my contract with AT&amp;T has expired and then I&apos;m just going to move to a different carrier."	0
I purchased this smart phone for my husband and it's the same size as my iPhone 7. My hubby really Likes the phone and it has everything he needs in a cell phone. Great phone	1
"I purchased this used Blackberry as an upgrade from my old cell phone. The Blackberry arrived in a timely manner, looked like new, and, after I finally figured out how to set it up *I&apos;m old and not very high tech* it works perfectly, sound quality is great, you get text, internet, plus has wifi so I am enjoying this cell."	1
"I purchased three different used Samsung SCH700 Gleam phones on e-bay that were described as being in excellent condition and had to return each one. The first phone, the seller reported that he dropped it and it broke.  The second phone did not work at all.  The battery was swelled and did not even fit in the phone properly.  The third phone powered up but would not receive a cell signal indicating a possible broken internal antenna."	0
"I purchased two of these phones. After about 50 days i started to notice a screen flickering issue on one of them. I didn't notice that there was a crack in the frame near the proximity/light sensor which caused the sensor to freak out and make the phone nearly unusable. Because it was past warranty the phone became target practice. The other phone overheated very quickly but again the issue didn't start till just after the warranty expired. I manged to fix this issue but now the battery life is crap and there is a burn in spot on the screen, and the sim card reader got too hot and the saudering melted together between two contacts and sims will no longer work in the phone. Avoid this model of LG, very unstable."	0
"I purchased what I thought was a 64g refurbished iPhone 6. However, when it arrived it would not even power on or take a charge. After talking with the seller I agreed to send it back at my cost for a replacement. Almost 2 weeks later they still are giving me the run around and still no phone."	0
I purchused online it took a month to get here price was great and phone itself was great but when i deliberatly made this purchuse for my favorite phone company that works with any UNLOCKED phones when i got it i had to sim put in and it didnt work i was very disapointed because i needed the new phone and i thought it had been unlocked already and was ready to go. Now i have to bring it in to a shop and pay MORE money to have it unlocked and wait longer to have a phone(like a month shipping wasnt long enough). I am NOT impressed it should be labeled as LOCKED. 	0
I put my phone in my pocket and took it out about 3 hours later with many scratches from my jeans.  WTF disappointed. 	0
I QUIT USING THE PHONE...you can&apos;t set the ringer and vibration to work together....It won&apos;t do picture mail. It will only send pics through E-Mail. When using Sprint TV it was broken up and choppy. I was real dissappointed with the phone. It wouldn&apos;t automatically download my contacts. I purchased a couple of ringers from Sprint...Both were not compatible with the MOTO Q9c.	0

I Rate  This Ebay Seller The Best Prices on  Ebay Quick Response  Ex items And Prices  on Cell phones  I paid this Great Ebay Seller  as soon as  he Respond to  me i recommend this  seller to Everyone  on ebay 	1
"I rated it excellent since it fits my needs perfectly. If you need a very stout phone with a HUGE speaker this is it. I am hard of hearing and wear glasses-the large speaker and large numbers when punching in a phone number are a boon.  Menus are a little hard to get used to but using &quot;shortcuts&quot; solves the problem easily. It has a mini SDHC slot to help store music, ringtones, pictures, etc. The USB port makes it easy to switch those items between the phone and a PC using the &quot;Samsung New PC Studio&quot; software. The back lit numbers and other keys are VERY easy to read in the dark. The battery lasts a LONG time between charges. Love it."	1
"I read a lot of reviews before choosing this model. Normal use battery life is good, but playing a game the battery goes quick. It&apos;s a smart phone, parr for the course. Getting the phone started with Verizon was another story, since there was no clerk at a store to do it for you that has done it a hundred times."	1
"I read and followed the directions. The phone doesnt turn on, what should be expected for a $10.00 phone. It is not worth the time to return."	0
i read that it would have scratches and worn but i received my item today (thumbs up it was only 2 days of shipping!) and there was one scratch i was like wow! its brand new :) thanks guys you are the best im hoping to buy more from you soon	1
"I read the instruction removed out side cover.  Installed battery.  Installed sim card.   Pluged the charger in.  It charged but quit soon.  I turned the phone on tried to text.  The phone when blank, it turned off.   Removed cover, removed battery and replaced battery.  Thought maybe it did not hook up right.   put it all back o battery indicator and it had shut off.   Started finding out how to return the phone.  It seemed like an intermittent problem, maybe a cold solder joi or defective circuit.    Got permission to return it and it is on the way to company.   I have had several Nokia phones over the years.  I like the windows OS,it hooks up to my laptop when I walk into the office.   Transfer data, keeping the computer and the phone in sync. "	0
"I realize I bought this used, but it was supposedly in excellent condition. 2 weeks after I got it the ear microphone went out. Apple quoted $200 to fix it. I have been told this is an issue with I phones."	0
"I really can not express an opinion now because I have not received the article or the cell phone yet, Thanks"	0
I really cant say anything bad about this phone. I dont use my phone to store lengthy media or a ton of apps. I like the size of the phone and I could not find any in my area for the right price. All I can say is the product is a++++++++++++ to me. I am tossing around buying another one just in case I break this one down the road. There is nothing wrong with owning a dinosaur. Thanks for an awesome product. 	1
"I really disappointed with this product and the seller. The seller didn&amp;apos;t state that this product :  1. Still in lock condition, so I have to spend extra cost to unlock it.  2. Has problem in its machine, It often suddenly turn off by itself. It could be 5 - 7 times in a day it turn off by it self. It&amp;apos;s a garbage.    From both above complain, I already submit it to the seller, but he felt out of his responsibility.    I&amp;apos;ll never buy cell phone/ electronic goods again via e-bay, especially from this seller. I don&amp;apos;t trust them."	0
"I really don&amp;amp;apos;t even think it deserves 1 star, truthfully.  I have one of these phones and within less than a month, I&amp;amp;apos;ve put it away and bought another phone.  It is slow, it powers off when it wants, it is horrible with battery life, and the signal jumps on it.  In reality, this phone is just a poor choice and is NOT worth even $5 to me.  I would not waste the money on one with knowing what I know now."	0
I really dont like the fact that i had some negative feedback on this item. The seller for this product was under investigation according to you people.The item I purchased was not what i bid on and the condition was horrible. Was no where near  what the seller made it seem .I wrote you people about it and did nothing about that so i was very dissapointed.So i still check the feedback on this seller and continues to do the same to others .I CANT BELIEVE YOU WOULD ALLOW THIS SELLER THIS LONG . BUT I WILL NO LONGER PURCHASE ANYTHING ELSE ON EBAY. BUT THANKS FOR ALLOWING ME TO SEND A REVIEW TO YOU . LATE	0
"I really doubted before buying this phone because I find it hard to trust someone on EBay. I finally got myself to buy this $500+ phone and was really excited about receiving it. Unfortunately, I ignored the first red flag and now Im paying for it. This phone was supposed to be new. I received it in an open damaged box. I still looked at it and the phone did look new so I ignored the box. I got the phone all set up and realized it was out of factory warranty. Not sure if the phone was used or not but upon doing some research I foinf out it was at least two years old. I was really excited and the phone seemed to be working well, so I ignored that and kept the phone even though I was told by friends not to. Exactly a month after I bought the phone, one day I found it off. I knew it was charged and I had not turned it off. The phone wouldnt restart and I had to contact the buyer for instructions on how to turn it back on. Since that day the phone has been close to useless. It re-starts by it self constantly, shuts off, kicks me out of apps, stops sending/receiving messages or calls until I re-start it, apps stop working randomly... i have to re-start the phone at least once an hour so what ever app I need will work. I contacted the buyer and el was told I could return it if it had"	0
"I really enjoy this phone. This is a good one so I encourage people to buy it. It has a good camera, the battery is really good. the price also is good. It is a simple phone with a lot of great qualities."	1
"I really enjoyed the features on this phone, but I have had some problems with it. The first time I dropped the phone on the ground, the main screen broke right in half. I took it in to T-Mobile because I had insurance. I received the new one and it worked very well for a long time. The phone, though, scratches very easily even if you take care of it. I purchased the leather protective case and still had scratches on the inside. I drop the phone again some months later, and the mini screen and the main screen both broke in the same way. The phone I had before that I dropped all the time and never had a problem with it. Yeah, I know I should be more careful with a cell phone, but this one breaks very easily. My roommate has the same phone, and he has a lot of problems with the phone reading the SIM card. Recently, I have also had problems with the connecting the SIM card. If you are not like me and you don&apos;t drop your phone, then I would recommend it. It is very easy to use and the sounds quality is amazing. It is also relatively affordable. The mp3 player works great if you buy the SanDisk card, too."	0
I really hated this phone. It was slow and turned off every 5minutes I couldn&apos;t get on twitter for more than ten minutes without it shutting the app down. The apps were horrible and they never worked. This phone was the worst. That&apos;s why I got the iPhone 4. Do not buy this phone unless you are super desperate	0
"I really like how this phone just flows and how my life can just be put into it, and yea stuff like that"	1
I really like my new phone it seems to work good	1
"I really like that phone ,but I am very new to Bay so I didn&apos;t see that shipping is only to USA!  Thanks that the seller understood me very good!  LL be nice without borders?!"	1
"i really like the phone but it just shuts down all the time. the seller is great and the shipping was ecxellent, but the problem was the dady after i got it and left feedback it started acting up. so i tried to reset it but i didnt have the pin number."	0
"I really like the phone! It&apos;s useful, convenient in use, good quality, laconic and stylish design. Moreover the phone based on Android operating system. Very important thing for me that it&apos;s unlocked, so it works not only with T-Mobile, but with local mobile systems too."	1
"I really like the phone, but the battery won&apos;t hold a charge for more than 24 hours, even when not being used.  My old phone did better than that.  I realize it&apos;s a used phone, but the poor battery should have been stated in the seller&apos;s information so I would have known what I was bidding on.  Now I need to buy a battery for it.  My daughter purchased the exact same phone, used, on ebay for $6.00 more from a different seller and received TWO batteries.  Her phone holds a charge for a week when not in use."	0
I really like the phone.  It works really well not to mention Virgin Mobile has great prepaid plans for it.  It has all of the works that any Blackberry has. I bought it because I wanted a Blackberry to keep track of things	1
I really like the phone. It would have been a really great phone if it would have been GSM Unlocked like the seller said it was. But was not able to use the phone.	0
"I really like the speed, power, and capabilities of this phone. Probably the nicest phone I have ever owned. The added stylus is just a huge added perk. Anyone looking to have the top tier technology in their pocket would be smart in purchasing this piece of modern day art."	1
"I really like this phone because it is reliable.  The battery last a very long time.  I can charge it and turn it off and the battery will hold a charge for weeks.  Even when it is on it will stay charged for a long time.  Moreover, I save a lot of money on minutes when I don't use them, because they roll over.  That's awesome!  Great phone:)"	1
"I really like this phone, it is by far the best phone I have had, it is very fast and Smooth. There are a lot of people saying bad things about the camera, but I figured out that if you learn how to use it you will always take nice pictures, especially at night when it performs better than most of the phones nowadays."	1
I really like this phone.	1
"I really like this phone. I don&apos;t really need a blackberry torch but has similarities minus the touch screen. Works well online for FB, Twitter ect.    Love the full querty keyboard for texting. Has lots of extra features. World clock, tipping, ect..    I would recommend this phone . I Love the color over other boring black phones."	1
"I really like this phone. I went out of my way to find a refurbished one to replace the one I dropped and broke.I paid $67 on Ebay and the phone is worth more. The camera is 8mp and really captures serious detail with auto tap focus, plus a slide zoom bar for really up close shots. I wouldn&apos;t load too much music or games though because it is over 4years old."	1
"I REALLY LIKE THIS PHONE. IT IS THE SECOND ONE I HAVE PURCHASED FROM THIS FANTASTIC SELLER.IT IS SUPER EASY TO USE AND YOU CAN JUST POP IN YOUR OLD SIMCARD,MY DAUGHTER IS ALWAYS WASHING HER CELLPHONE OR HAVING SOME SORT OF MISHAP AND THESE PHONES ARE LIFESAVERS FOR US! PLUS, THEY COME WITH A BATTERY AND CHARGER! WHAT MORE CAN YOU ASK FOR! AND A BONUS! A FANTASTIC PRICE! AND SPEEDY SHIPPING TOO! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PHONE AND THIS SELLER!"	1
I really like this phone... sleek and powerful!  	1
I really like this phone..owned one for years and still works great!..unlike these blackberries that break within the first year of use...and I dont baby this phone...	1
"I really liked all that it offered, but the screen had some lines down it after one simple small drop, that didn&apos;t even mark up the phone. I&apos;d advise against this phone!"	0
I really liked the product. The turn around for shipping was amazing. This was exactly what I was looking for.  Great seller.  Would definitely use them again.	1
I really liked the service i received from the guys at cellular company. unfortunately my phone MMS/Picture Mail would not work for me and i sent it back and received a full refund...i would definitely purchase from them in the future.	0
"I really liked this phone it was in good condition, very easy to manuver and convienent to have. especially because it had a keyboard for typing and then slide down so that u could dial to make a call but could be used either way or u could just use the front of the phone to call."	1
"I really liked your product, I found a good price for quality and I really like the reputation. and reviewing the comments left by other buyers sentii confidence in the vendor and the product, I&apos;m really satisfied with your purchase. Thanks"	1
I really love how this item is compatible with my att go phone sim card and plan. I can now have a smartphone on a really cheap budget!	1
"I really love LG phones, and I honestly HATED that I had to post a negative review on this . Because my friend used it, and he hated it, and i used it and was like uhghhhghh this phone stinks. The phone has battery life that is only 9 hours or so, even since he got it. It continually restarted, and reminds him of alarms/alerts he&apos;s read and responded to. It has a camera, but that went bad too, it has a web browser, it&apos;s only displaying in mobile view, and it is SLOOOOWWWWW, AND i believe this was one of the 3G sprint phones, this phone was just horrible, and he has the rumor touch now. I hope this review helps you not get this, or for matter get rid of it. Chocolate touch and Rumor Touch, outperform this phone any-day. It was tons of frustration, and it never worked. So STAy away from the LG Reveal/LOTUS."	0
I really love the cellphone cause it does have some sweet ringtones with it.I have really enjoyed the cell phone alot thank you so much ok.	1
"I really love the support that this phone has, the 32GB of storage OMG, the immaculate iPod touch  It is just an awesome Phone"	1
I really love this phone. I've had iPhones for last 5 years and wanted to downsize. This phone is great because its easy to text and the touch screen features make it easy to navigate. If you are looking to reduce your bill and being on the internet is not that important than this phone is for you.	1
"I really love to use this phone. It&apos;s a complete remake of the S700/S710, with Walkman features. Although it lacks 850MHz, it is still good overall, so for all the people going to Asia during the summer break, the 3G is a really nice advantage.    Also, this cool phone packs a nice 2MP camera with auto-focus and macro.    With around 500MB built in memory, you don&apos;t have to spend too much extra money for a bigger memory card, but I just bought a 4GB memory stick pro duo that recently came out.    I would say that this is overall an excellent phone, and Sony Ericsson&apos;s UI is very easy to use and even I learned without an instruction manual.    If you want to drop the 3G, built-in memory, and swivel phone, I&apos;d really recommend the Sony Ericsson W810i, has all the same features except 3G, built-in memory, and it&apos;s a clamshell, but it comes with a 512MB memory card."	1
I REALLY loved this phone.  My favorite feature was the (easy to use) &apos;only accept certain people&apos;s calls feature&apos;.  The feature would allow you to go through your phone book and quickly pick as many people as you would like to talk to. The people you do not want to talk to are directed straight to voicemail if they call.  The screen is high quality.  A++ :)	1
"I really needed a phone and I was on a tight budget and the HTC Desire C was one of the readily available options that was on my budget. Being on an auction, i was able to get it for 15.59 and i thought it was a steal and it was. The phone arrived in pretty good shape, I expected it to have a lot more nicks or wear to it, but all in all it was nice."	1
I really recommend this product.	1
I really want this for me. Do I really need this new phone. I was really like this phone. Today I gave the phone to my niece 	1
I really wanted this phone but the seller went belly-up. I had to put this purchase in dispute and get my money back.	0
"I REALLY WAS IMPRESSED WITH THIS PHONE BUT THEN I GOT AN UPGRADE TO A DIFFERENT PHONE FROM A GF THAT SURPRISED ME AND I ONLY USED THIS FOR 3 MONTHS, NONETHELESS IT WORKED GOOD AND I USED IT AND LOVED IT. THANKS FOR LETTING ME SHARE, NARN"	1

"I received a email saying my purchased item was delivered. I went out to check & there was nothing. After hours of waiting I decided to go around the block to see if they had delivered it to the wrong house, And so they did. The house it was shipped to was an abandon house. I had to jump the fence to get my package. Once I got it, on my way back home I opened it & the phone wasn't even in the box. The box was broken & the phone was just laying out with no type of protection. Phone was dirty, box was dirty, not original charging cable, headphones were dirty. Not worth it. "	0
"I received a motorola l205 in the mail just as i requested....the descriptive info about the phone not being brand new, scratches, ect. was right on thank you...unfourtunatly i will have to look at the return policy or resell it..thankyou ebay for giving me that option when theres no return policy,your ebay buyer"	1
"I received a phone that was running a custom rom.  The phone did not update as the software update button did nothing.  This is not a legitimate product.  I got a real one from a competing site, had to pay more but it's nice knowing your using a real device."	0
"I received an email saying I had won the buy it now for this item, I never even looked at this item. In fact, before now, I hadn't even logged in to EBay in several months. So I was either hacked or it was a scam. I wrote the seller and the transaction was cancelled. "	0
I received IPhone 6 not IPhone 6 Plus. It's not worth the money I paid for it. 	0

"I received my iPhone quickly with no box, the phone itself scratched and used. The seller did include extra made in China charger. So just heads up it's not a new iPhone. Not happy with my purchase at all. "	0
"I received my Moto Z9 from AT&amp;T, this phone has all the features you would expect from a non-PDA phone but I find it clumsy and too big to carry.  I know that it has GPS, but I do expect to use that feature unless I suddenly find myself lost in the woods - and knowing AT&amp;T; I probably wouldn&apos;t get signal there anyway.     I recently upraded from a Sony/Ericcson W580i which was wonderful.  I was primarily looking for call clarity to reduce dropped calls and to reduce noise.  I was told by the techs at AT&amp;T that the network in my area (Sacramento, CA) suffers from severe bandwidth issues due to them losing 1/2 of all their towers when their lease expired with T-Mobile in Feb of 2008, and further degraded in June of 2008 when millions of iPhones attached to their 3G network.     Despite the clams by Motorola about their crystal clear technology, I found the reception and clarity of the Z9 no better than my Sony.    The bluetooth feature seemed to link very good with my Plantronics 521, and I was able to hear the call as good as talking on the headset.  It has a very good range too.    The camera has all the same problems of any camera phone, and the pictures are OK.  There is a built in video light next to the camera that would be more helpful as a flash. And you cannot turn the camera shutter noise off.  On the plus side, I would imagine that you could use the video light as an emergency flashlight.    The user tools such as Calendar are not as good as expected.  I Purchased the Motorols Phone tools v. 5.0 software and it took me nearly two hours to install and my computer had trouble connecting with the phone.  It successfully synced about 95% of my Outlook calendar and appointment data, but errored on some appointments due to a &quot;fields not supported&quot; error.  Even worse it did not tell me which appointments it couldn&apos;t sync, making my phone calendar unreliable as I still need to check Outlook everyday for appointment data.    Overall I&apos;d give it a C-, for the size and cost it would make sense to buy an iPhone or Blackberry."	0
I RECEIVED MY NEW VERIZON SAMSUNG INTENSITY PHONE TODAY. I GAVE IT TO MY SON FOR HIS BIRTHDAY &amp; HE SAYS ITS PERFECT &amp; IN PERFECT CONDITION. THANK YOU.	1
I received my phone 2 days faster than promised and it is AMAZING!! Thank you.	1
"I received my phone as promised.  Phone exterior was in good condition, but the display stopped working after two hours.  I could not read the caller ID nor was I able to view a phone number I dialing.  It turned out to be a big hassle and I did contact the seller and had no response.     It is better to buy direct from the Sprint Store."	0
I received my phone on time didnt have to wait long but it wasnt as described. It did NOT come in its original packaging and it kinda looks used...but I still like it.	0
"I received my phone quickly, seller communicates well, and the phone works great! Very happy with the item I purchased. Will buy from this seller again in the future."	1
I received my phone today. First the phone didn't have then fast charging Mod as advertised. Second the phone turns off every 20 or 30 on it's own.  It was advertised as pre-owned which is suppose to be better. That isn't the case here.	0
"I received my phone with a crack in the screen. I barely gets service anywhere and I have tried to contact the seller but he never writes back. I am so unsatisfied!!! However, the phone is a good size and the case is nice but it constantly get pop ups in Chinese that are difficult to get out. The battery does not last that long and I just dislike this purchase."	0
"I received my Samsung galaxy note 4 and it's speakerphone function as well as the ability to listen to music option was broken!  When I contacted the seller to let them know that it was defective merchandise on their end, they would not work with me to fix it!  I am disabled, on a fixed income and couldn't afford THEIR way of fixing the problem (which was for me to purchase an entire new cell and WAIT for the refund on this one) they simply just suggested that I open an eBay case!  I am BEYOND pissed!!!!  This seller does not understand the meaning of customer service!  Less than 1 star!"	0
I received phone nothing was erased. I expected a flip chocolate and it wasn't. I guess that was my fault.  My husband has returned to his very old LG. 	0
I received the cellphone with the LCD broken!	0
"I received the device very quickly, it was carefully packaged and everything works as expected. Very good value for the price! "	1
I received the item in new sealed conditions. The phone is working with no problems. Fast Shipping. I highly recommend this seller.	1
I received the item not as described. I bougt it unlocked and the item had a label saying if you upgrade it will be locked.   The seller agreed to return the item and he pays me full refund.  He received the item but did not refund me so far.  I opened a case with eBay and they close it without resolving and with no reason. I talked to them and they referred me tyo paypal. Paypal was not any better.  I thing these companies are protecting the cheating sellers.	0
I received The LG V10 phone that I ordered for my daughter through misty electronic store on eBay the phone is flawless it works perfectly and I am very pleased with it I would recommend the store to anyone because of the quality of products that they sell	1
"I received the mobile phone without a charger or a battery.  Seller said he ""forgot"" to mention that is doesn't come with a charger. He also said  his listing stated no battery but that is NOT TURE ! I have screen shots of the listing to prove that listing didn't mention whatsoever that batter is not included due to Bulgarian post regulations. can post the screen shot if needed. This phone has been discontinued for years so it is totally useless without its unique charge plug and no battery!! I've had this type of phone before and it is a great secondary phone being so thin and good battery life. No need to carry a second LARGE phone especially when traveling and for making calls and simple text messages. "	0

I received the phone and found I could not hear calls in ear speaker. I returned the phone but asked for a replacement. Today I was told by PayPal that I got a refund instead of a phone. I got no explanation from the seller. I'm very disappointed in the seller.	0

Please return all available items from the original purchase in the best condition you can"" so I did. Of course the charger was going to be used since i had for a few weeks before it was locked. Now he doesn't give me my FULL refund because he said it was sent back in poor condition?? Not to mention turned around and relisted it! Beware of these people!"	0

So, the phone does NOT text at all.  I told the seller this, he got defensive.  I mentioned that I wasn&apos;t satisfied because the phone was listed that he accepts returns and pays shipping.  He shot back at me &quot;what do you mean you aren&apos;t satisfied?

I received the phone two months ago with everything in Chinese. It took me a while to figure out how to change the operating language to English. But many buttons and many parts of the text are still in Chinese. I have not yet managed to call HTC office in Hong Kong because of the time difference.     The phone looks like a great purchase. But HTC must make it usable in the US if they want to sell it there.    John	0
I received the phone with heavy scratches and dents not listed. Asked for a $15 refund to fix the screen at cost and they refused. Told me to send back for a refund Which doesnt help since customer of mine really needed.  Buyer aware. 	0
"I received the phone within the delivery timeframe however the phone would not charge, make out going calls, receive calls.  The phone did not work at all.  I tried calling the telephone number on the packing slip and I was not surprised that the number did not work either.  Lucky I paid through paypal and was able to get a full refund.  Do not order from this seller unless you would like to get ripped off!"	0
I received the pink iPhone and the battery does within five minutes after charging all evening. I cant hear any phone call properly so the speaker is in horrible condition. Scratches on back of phone and white spot on front when turned on. Huge waste of money on a product that shouldve been in better condition 	0
"I received the purchase on time, however I am having major issues! I would not recommend purchasing here if you want a phone that works!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"	0
I received the wrong phone but it was an honest mistake. Seller took care of the problem promptly and was very communicative and helpful in the process.	1
I received this iPhone and after working for a day proceeded to completely shut done. After bringing it to Apple it turns out the phone was completely water logged and not salvageable. Lost my daughters money because the seller will not give me a refund minus the shipping. Don't buy anything from kairebear.	0
I received this item stating 9/10. Was more like 8/10. Paid extra for nothing. Feel cheated.	0
I received this phone and never used it because both sims did not work and the person who sold it to me on eBay never responded back to me when i sent in pictures showing that the sims on this phone was bad when the phone went in test mode.	0
I received this phone om 10/22. It was sent without the charger cord which meant I couldn't use it. I tried to reach this gentleman probably 15 times by phone at all hours to ask him to send it. I guess he recognized my name and city. No answer. Finally I went to Verizon and purchased one for $30.00 plus tax.  I am extremely upset. I paid too much for it in the first place. There is some minor damage on the face but I will forget that.	0
I received this phone thinking it was new and unlocked but in fact it was tied to Orange in French.  The phone was unlocked but some features are locked to Orange and are in French. For example the TV control feature defaults to Orange schedules in French. This is most annoying and I feel he seller misled buyers. The offending Orange apps cannot be removed. I contacted the seller to help resolve this problem but I have not received a reply. Overall this is not a great buy. Battery life is also suspect. Once the battery level goes down to 35% the phone shuts off making it pretty unreliable.	0
"I received this phone two weeks ago. I wrapped it up to give to my mother for Christmas. The morning of I'm trying to activate the phone and it's telling me to call MetroPCS. Upon calling them, I found out the phone is register in someone else's name. If this was a brand new phone, it shouldnt be registered to anyone.    Never the less I contacted the seller, no attitude or anything. I asked if he can please contact metro and have his name or whoever the phone belongs to name removed from the IMEI of the phone so that I can activate it. He was quick to respond back and say he was on a flight to Dubai and would do it on the 27th. I told him it was a gift for my mother and I wanted to set up the phone for her before I left because, I don't live with her and she's an older lady. He apologized and said he would call when he land and to use the wifi on the phone in the mean time. I did not pay to have a phone just be used for the internet. Can't even use the wifi calling. I NEVER heard back.      So yesterday I reached out again, nothing. So I told him at this point I would like a refund because this is sounding sketchy and my mother needs a phone. I would go to a metro store like I should have done in the beginning and purchase the phone. He then responded back saying he would proces"	0

"I received this Samsung pink phone, which was supposed to be NEW, and it didn't work from the day I got it out of the box!  It wouldn't take a charge and never got past the opening initial page where it says Samsung!  I tried different chargers, different cords, and different outlets - it was a defective phone. I have the same exact phone and model now at home, and it's a dud too, with the antenna being defective and it takes 8 hours to charge - so maybe it's just this particular model."	0

"I recently bought a Nokia 5310 from Ebay company bigbigworld2011 about a little over a month ago.     First off last December my first time on Ebay I used my mom&apos;s Ebay account to purchase the same product from the same company.     They advertised a blue Nokia 5310 they sent a refurbished red phone with blue trim only on the outside it was minus the standard blue Nokia 4310 background unlike as advertised.     Not knowing better I thought I had only ten days to return it and could not afford tracking but provided them with a Customs number Receipt.     They told me wait 5 days past the time I could have left feedback promising that if I could prove it left the country they would then replace the phone with the correct order whether they received it or not.     They then spat in my face with an abruptly rude email, all correspondence was then by email through my mom&apos;s email account. It greatly vexed me they had done this it was a &apos;bad experience&apos;.    I ordered from them again approximately two months ago this time after having established my own Ebay account. They knew who I was and promised me they would check the merchandise before shipped to be sure it was the correct as advertised order, I believe them.    I left an early comment good feedback they mocked me in the response. I should have waited.     I should also be able to retract good feedback anything sent prior to arrival of product or within the amount of days before bad feedback can be left is to be within reach of retracting and re-entering it is misleading for other Ebay users for this option to not be provided.    They sent me the same none advertised product again and with a spite to it for the amount they had heard from me when I used my mom&apos;s Ebay account. Not only did they sent a none as advertised they sent me a phone with operating flaws a poor functioning device.    I did not remove the screen cover that comes with any new phone but they had planted a minute piece of sticky tape residue under the screen to make it look like the screen was with flaw but in the hope I would remove the new screen cover file that I might only take pictures next ultimately it was aimed at tampering with the product so it could be used against me were I to return it as I very well would be.     They then told me I would need to pay for the return shipping then they would reimburse, they were for no other way to put it &apos;lying&apos;.    When I returned the first order made through my mom&apos;s Ebay account I believe they received the merchandise only to deny it as they very well had in the face of what they&apos;d fist promised.    They would have me pay for shipping and told me they expected me to insure it running me about 90 in the hole with the same $60 cost for the 2nd phone and they would have denied the reimbursement or sending the same but correct product for me as I wanted the order corrected I needed a phone last December but had gone without up until then.    I contacted Ebay and was first tole they were to send shipping labels for me. I then contacted Ebay over the phone upon their insistence I pay for shipping and tracking insurance and was told they would be contacted with the option of &gt;providing the labels&lt; or simply reimbursing and letting me keep the product which immediately happened next.    They were looking to burn me again only this time it came with an added spite by them somewhat of what seems to me to be a self gratitude problem.    I got to keep the product poorly performs has none refurbished issues. Thank y"	0
"I recently bought an unlocked Motorola Slvr L7.  I registered the phone via Motorola website to avail myself with the manufacturer&apos;s warranty.  A couple of weeks ago, the joystick on the middle of the keypad broke and I sent the phone to Motorola to be repaired.  Last week I received my phone unrepaired.  I called Motorola and they said that the warranty cannot be used here in the US.  The phone was not made for the US market, it carries a software not for US market therefore, they cannot repair the phone.  I argued that there was nothing wrong with the phone except for a broken piece on the keypad which can easily be replaced.  I even asked them to just send me the keypad and I&apos;ll replace it myself.  They still refused to honor the warranty.  So beware of buying Motorola unlocked phones meant for markets outside the US.  Motorola USA will not honor your warranty."	0
I recently bought this phone and returned it. It&apos;s supper laggy and I had a lot of problem with it. No i wasn&apos;t expecting it to be the best of the best..i mean its a fake I-phone... but i also didn&apos;t expect it to be so bad o.o. I don&apos;t think i&apos;d recommend this phone for anyone.  I&apos;m just happy the seller was willing to work things out in the end.  My suggestion is add another $20-50 bucks and get a better phone.	0

"I recently got a brand cell phone for $5  I went to www.gadgets.ipodgifts.net and signed up and complete one offer.     I would recommend either The Total Credit Check or the eAuction tutor Offer they are both free and i kept the eAuction tutor offer to use with ebay. Another cool offer is the king.com a skill gaming site costs $5 or the Netflix DVD rental but that costs $8.99 there are many more to choose from if those dont take your fancy.    Then all you do is choose which item you want and wait for it to drop through your door.     give it a go what have you got too lose, i have got all the latest gadgets this way . just go to www.gadgets.ipodgifts.net"	1
I recently purchased a Blackberry from these guys and it arrived in the exact time they said it would.  When I opened the box I was missing one of the batteries listed on the listing.  I hopped on eBay and contacted them about it.  Fifteen minutes later I got a message saying they would send it out ASAP and about 3 days later they arrived.  I appreciate these guys admitting the mistake and rendering it with great speed. A+++++	1
"I recently purchased a Motorlola Cell phone for my daughter, least to say she loved it.  It had the perfect features she was looking for. One setback not the sellers fault was that when she went to change the phone for use the cricket store said it was not usable in our area.  What a shame."	1
"I recently purchased an 16 GB unlocked Android 5.1 smart phone 6"" cell 8.0OMP Quad Core XGODY Y13. they said it was compatible to Verizon, so not true. I have returned the phone to the seller and its taken almost 2  weeks and no reply to get my refund. I'm now getting ready to go via PAYPAL for my refund. I would not suggest anyone to do business with this seller if u have to do a return, or seek a refund!!!!!! "	0
I recently purchased the Motorola A455 (Verizon Wireless) everything went great with the purchase between seller and buyer.  I purchased buyshield protection plan for insurance.  A month after purchasing my phone got damaged.  I called buyshield and they had me call Motorola.  Motorola said they are charging $75.00 to look at the phone.  Why do you offer buyer protection if they aren&apos;t going to cover the product to be repaired.  The phone cost $175.00 and I can&apos;t afford to spend anymore money on it.  I really don&apos;t think I&apos;ll be using eBay or Paypal anymore.  I had one other experience where I didn&apos;t ever receive my item purchased for Christmas.  I think I had enough.  It&apos;s to much of a risk.    Jean Alexander	1
"I recently purchased this phone new off of eBay.  I knew that it was a popular phone in Europe (SL55) and I wanted to try out a slider.  Pros: compact and stylish.  Decent reception and easy to hear caller.  Cons: Short battery life, easy to crack face, somewhat complicated menu functions (hard to find what you&apos;re looking for).  Definetly have a manual with this one.  Lets just say that I would own another one if this broke.  UPDATE:  I had this phone for about three months and it started falling apart.  I basically had to replace all of the parts on it one by one before I finally gave up on it.  I hated this phone by the end of it all.  I would avoid buying it."	0
"I recently tried to buy the screen protector on August 29th 2016, and when I tried to pay for it, it said it's ""not shippable"" to my address. I have sent many messages about it and they don't answer back. What a waste of time with these people. "	0
I recieced it with a vertical yellow line on the screen. Was taken to phone repair to have a look at it. It was suggested that it had its batterery replaced. Makes me think whether it's brand new or not.	0
"I recieved a LG lotus. The phone was just how it was described, shipped fast, and got here perfectly! Thank you!"	1
I RECIEVED THE PHONE AFTER MORE THAN 2 WEEKS AFTER PAYING FOR IT.  IT CAME IN A HORRIBLE CONDITION.  THE SCREEN WAS SUPER SCRATCHED UP.. TO THE POINT THAT YOU CAN BARELY SEE THE IMAGES..  NO BATTERY DOOR CAME WITH THIS ITEM..  IT WAS A TOTAL WASTE OF MY MONEY..  AND IF YOU LEAVE THEM NEGATIVE FEEDBACK THEY VOID YOUR WARRANTY...  WHICH IS TOTAL AND PURE BULL..  AND I DID LEAVE NEGATIVE FEEDBACK IN HOPES TO WARN ANYONE ELSE WANTING TO PURCHASE FROM THEM..  THEY EVEN SENT ME A LETTER ASKING ME TO REMOVE MY NEGATIVE COMMENT   HA HA.. NOT...	0
"I recieved the phone with a broken touch screen.  This I expected. The listing said to repair it was easy. For him maybe but for someone not experienced very hard,but I did it. This is not my complaint. My complaint is that the phone had a password. This cannot be revoved by any combination of letters I got from the internet or samsung. If I want it fixed I have to ship it to samsung. If the seller examinated the phone, which was represented in working order,they must have know this!!! I have not been in touch with the seller as it was over a month before I learned how and repaired the phone touchscreen (which I also bought through ebay and was very satisfyed."	0
I recieved this but didn't plug it in for a few weeks.When I charged it the first time (tonight) I realized a line of the crystals on the left side were broken. Gave it two stars for fast shipping and for being mostly functional. It should have said in the listing that it was broken though. 	0
I recived the cellphone it works very nice but the charger dosen&apos;t work I haved to buy another charger.	0

"I replaced my Nokia 3220 with the 7360. I was excited to get it and it is a pretty phone. I&apos;m not into ringtones, videos, photos, etc, so even though this phone has those features and many others, I just use it as a good ole&apos; regular cell phone.    This phone is bigger than I thought. Definitely bigger than my 3220.  One thing I had trouble with, was setting up the speed dial. It would ask me if I want to set it up, I&apos;d say yes, then it would ask me to enter the phone # and the name and I would. Then it would ask again if I want to set up speed dial (on the same digit), etc... after entering the info again, it would keep on asking again to set up speed dial... and kept going in a circle. That was extremely annoying. 20 minutes later I finally figured it out, I don&apos;t know how, but after turning the phone off and on a few times, it finally set up my speed dials. It was annoying because this is a brand new phone, it shouldn&apos;t have had any glitches.    I also didn&apos;t like the fact that the buttons are hard (my 3220 had soft rubber buttons). It is also extremely difficult to open the back to install the sim card.    The resolution on the camera is definitely better than the 3220. I hate the handsfree earphones/microphone. The microphone is placed halfway down on your chest and there is no way to adjust it higher.    The speaker is great. Even in a crowd the sound is great.    I received this phone with a German Manual, not English, and a European wall charger. That&apos;s the seller&apos;s fault, not the phone&apos;s. It was easy to download the English version of the manual from the internet and easy to purchase a charger from Ebay. Make sure when you do purchase this phone that it comes with the correct manual and charger.    I am a huge fan of Nokia phones and will keep on buying them."	0
I requested nice to off the bid and he sent me nasty rude and being insulted for no reason.. he is just got mad cuz he did not get money.	0
"I rescently bought a Sanyo RL-4930 cell phone. I had one before, but it got damaged. So I went on Ebay to find another. I love this phone because it it sturdy with rubber wrapped all around it. Has a battery that last a very long time. I dont have texting or any of the bells and whistles. I just like it because it&apos;s just a good phone. If I wanted, I could get the frills, internet etc, but I only use it to contact friends and family. Simply a great phone. Bill."	1
i researched phones online for a few days before settling on the lg cu515.  i had previously been using a sony ericcson which was literally falling apart.  everytime i dropped it (about three times) big chunks of the phone would chip off and continue to pull apart over time.    i am excited to finally love my phone. i&apos;ve only dropped the lg cu515 once but there was no breakage at all.  i also enjoy all the features on the phone. the camera works great in sunlight (like most camera phones).    overall i am very pleased and i was very happy to receive it so quickly.	1
I researched the product before purchasing and knew what I was getting. got a great price for it. 	1
"i return it bc , not like description, he said it&apos;s mint condition but i found this the screen for this phone was broken already . and i opened case direct after i got it . and return it then after 2 days from his delivery he combline about me . and eba return my money back"	0
I return this phone because it was still connected to sprint. And couldnt connect it to my account. And still waiting for them to credit my pay pal. Not very happy. It been very inconvenience situation. 	0
"I returned it. Since it was described as 'good' condition, I didn't expect flawless clean device. I could accept some scratch at the rims and back. But if it's not working as described, it's different story. First, battery was bad, just two hours of using it consumed 40~50% of battery which will make you nervous if you are outside for a while. Second, Touch id didn't work. Touch id is a security function using your fingerprint, and it is a big part of iPhone function. you send money or purchase apps in a second without typing anything. When you sell your iPhone not working this function, your phone will be regarded as scrap. I don't know if it was just mine, but I definitely wanna stay away from this seller.."	0

I seemed to be buying a phone from an individual in Canada. Received a phone from a tech resale giant in the USA. I was charged all kinds of currency exchange fees & taxes for a cross borders sale that was never across borders in the first place. NOW THE SELLER IS CALLING MY FAMILY AND THREATENING THEM HARM. SUSPICIOUSLY ALL MY NUMBERS HAVE ALSO BEEN RECEIVING CRAZY PRANK CALLS ALL DAY! WORST TRANSACTION I'VE EVER HAD!	0
"I sent a message at least 3 times with no response. On the day that it was supposed yo be delivered, they marked it as shipped with a tracking number. It stayed as waiting for item for several days. I had to generate a report. Total waste of my time!"	0

"I set my phones to ring and vibrate. When I recharge this phone it resets itself to &quot;Loud&quot; but does not ring at all. Fortunately the voice mail catches the call. I missed a few calls before I figured out what the defect was.    It came with two batteries. Good thing, under minimal use, one battery just isn&apos;t enough.    The phone was not expensive. As long as I carry an extra battery, or car charger and keep an eye on the settings, it may be worth the price."	0
"I should have took my 250 dollars, and thrown it in the toilet and flushed... I would have gotten more pleasure and less frustration that purchasing this item from this seller!! I won&apos;t make the same mistake again."	0
I should start with saying that I&apos;m quite impressed with the service and the quality for the products. I received the items in good cosmetic condition. unfortunately for me some of the included items were faulty but the seller agreed to re-ship those faulty items free of charge. The phone is really good and I have no regreats in purchasing this. I would not recommend this phone For those who look for a computer within a phone. I believe that a Computer should be left to do the work of a computer while a Phone should be left to do the work of a phone. This phone is for people who appriciate style and beauty with quality of speech and sound as well as compatibility with modding its firmware to the way they like. It has all the features that a decent phone nowadays would pocess and has given me no issues so far. It&apos;s fun to use this phone.    All in all I think I had a pleasent experience and I would recommend this seller as well as pay-pal and e-bay to my friends.    I should make a note to all those who go for &quot; too-good-to-be-true deals on PEN DRIVES. I had a really bad experience. PLEASE DO NOT BUY PEN DRIVES WITHOUT A PROPER BRAND NAME. THEY ARE ALL FAKE !!! &quot;    Thank you.	1
I simply made a mistake with my bid and this seller got really offended. Mistakes can happen because we are humans.	0
"I so wanted to leave a great review, but unfortunately, mine is not as good as others.   I've had three (3) issues with it:  (1) DELIVERY: Since the carrier used by the seller did not require a signature on delivery, my package was missing for a day - tracking info said ""delivered and left with individual (not me)"" but the package was never to be found until much later. When I notified the seller, the responsibility of finding the package was put on me.  (2) EARPHONE:  It is broken.  Does not work.  But I don't want to deal with the return and re-delivery that could be problematic like the initial delivery (missing package), so I decided to buy an earphone on my own.  I have informed the seller about this, but no response so far.  (3) CHARGER:  Loose parts coming off.  But I can use the charger by pushing the loose part in, so I am OK with it.  I have informed the seller about this, but no response so far."	0

I sold my note 8.... Nice phone... But... Bottom line... That you can Replace the Battery... And the SD card... And Awesome camera with the Dak feature.... The Battery thing is a Biggie... I've always caught myself with hardly no juice... What good is a phone with a dead battery...I have 4 backup batteries... I'll never be without juice again.... Thanks LG	1
I SORT OF LIKED IT AND MAYBE WOULD THINK ABOUT BUYING ANOTHER ONE ONLINE.  ONE CELLPHONE I BOUGHT WAS GREAT THIS ONE SUCKED AND I GUESS WHEN YOU BUY CHEAP IT PAYS AT THE END SO I WOULD JUST REALLY SEE WHO U ARE BUYING IT FROM.	0
I sought from photo and description it was okay. But When I got item it was terrible. He uses good photo and sending bad product. How can he sell one item to two buyers?  Other buyer leaves good feedback.  I wrote a message. But I did not get any respond. No excuse like this for pansbuiness. Think about myself before buy items. He is cheater. Do not buy from this seller.	0
I spent $300 to fix this phone and then it's supposed to be open let me unlock what is an unlock all the way I've been having trouble with it it comes up saying I don't have the right SIM card in it says it needs them Verizon SIM card is supposed to be unlocked and don't supposed to do that but it's doing that and I can't bring it back either very disappointed P.S .altogether I spent over 600 something dollars I could have bought me a Samsung 7 Edge	0

I suggest that you find out if the provider has cleared all of the restrictions. I still have sprints activation on mine.  I use my phone for business and can not be without a phone.  The seller did offer to relace or refund. I'll get mine from China next time. I had no problems and everything was cleared.	1
"I switched from a Samsung Galaxy Stardust because the carrier TracFone placed me with did not cover an area I often travel to.  They suggested the LG Destiny that would work in both my home area and my travel destination.   I was apprehensive at first because I was very used to the Samsung and how it functioned.  I was so pleased with the LG Destiny arrived.  It was only a little bigger with it's 4.5inch screen and runs on 4G. My Samsung was a 4 inch screen and ran on 3G.  To my findings the operation and functions were almost identical to how the Samsung operated.  I like that is has an FM Radio too which the Samsung did not have.  Overall, I think you get more for your money with the LG.  I am happy with the TracFone customer service and their suggestion was spot on."	1
"I switched to two different android phones, but ended up going back to the iphone 6. I bought this one used and it's a little bent and scratched up but nevertheless I still like it more than my two samsungs which aren't even beat up like this one. "	1
"I test it a lot of time, and the battery literally it dies with nothing on, I even try some battery apps and its the same result, it no longer supports more than a day and even I'm not using it a lot!! I will not recommend this phone, I like LG Android OS but the battery its a big issue on this phone!!"	0

"i think i see the picture og phone before i buy it very good...but when you saw it,i really do not like it...an case very old.. i can not use it for everything"	0
I think it is the worse phone ever. Fake advertisement by sellers. The phone battery is the worse ever; how can they sell a phone that the battery last only 20 minutes in a good day. I tried 3 different phone and all of them have the same battery problem. Those sellers should stop using false advertisement.	0
I think it was just like new no accessery but that was all good i was replaceing same phone identically. very good!	1
i think its a fake. I already have nokia 5310 and this one is not the same. plastic is worse. so dont by from this seller!	0
"I think its the best phone:  easy to use,  everything you need at your fingertips,  easy access to the Internet,  good camera,  very nice design.  I love the company Apple"	1

"I think this seller is one of the best on ebay!  I bought a phone(new) and it was much cheaper than it would be from AT&amp;T.  There was a problem with the phone, and I wasnt expecting anything, but I wrote the seller, and instead of the &quot;oh well, buyer beware, or its a warranty thing, send it to LG, their response was &quot;no problem, sometimes things happen.  Youre still under our warranty, send it back, and we&apos;ll send the replacement right back&quot;  This is SERVICE!!! I will never buy a phone, no matter what brand from a phone carrier, They will get ALL of my business from now on, as well as recommendations to everyone I know!!!"	1

I THINKED THAT I CAN UNLOCK THIS PHONE AND USE IT FOR GSM BUT I TRY MANY UNLOCK SITES -NOT POSSIBLE.I ASK THE SELLER ABOUT UNLOCK THIS PHONE  AND I GET (AS I UNDERSTAND WITH MY ENGLISH) TWO DIFFERENT ANSWER:      1.nope this phone is not unlockable. thanks  2.Sorry but this phone cannot be unlocked..  IS IT RIGHT?	0
"I thought for sure that the newer T659 would be an upgrade to my nearly 3 year old SGH T629 (it broke and I needed a quick replacement). There are some nice features about the phone, but the thing that really disappointments me is the lack of voice recognition and voice dialing. This missing and (IMHO) absolutely essential feature was not made clear in T-Mobile&apos;s feature list. In fact, it the feature list that I found on T-Mobile&apos;s site, it is listed as having Voice Recognition. Don&apos;t believe it! If I had known this, I would NOT have purchased the phone. If it was convenient, I would give this phone back and probably buy the older SGH T629. Sorry, but with all the state laws that require hands-free phone operation while driving, there is no excuse for a blue-tooth enabled phone to not have VR."	0
I thought I was buying an unlocked phone but it was not so seller said to send back for refund but I never received the postage and no other help from seller 	0
I thought I was getting a good deal - I purchased the phone  and it took a while to get to me but I still gave the seller the benefit of the doubt. The phone was not activated for more than a week and a half before it gave me problems - after 2 weeks I contacted my carrier and they advised me that it was the phone.? the auction listing stated &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;used for about half of a year ??&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; but my carrier stated that the insurance on it had already expired that it was bought from an ebayer in 2007? So I guess I learned my lesson and will never buy from this seller again. I contacted the seller and his response was his listing said no returns accepted and that I would need to contact my carrier for repairs.. isnt that something.. I may request a FULL refund. Since Im stuck with No phone again	0

A very expensive paper weight is all this phone is good for "	0
I thought the features sounded great and they do problem is after charging four hours it would not even boot up Then I looked at the recent feedback and others are having trouble too not recommended . 	0
I thought the phone was in working condition and turns out that if ever I purchase other phones if they have water damage I will make sure not to waste money on that kind of product because they are not good.

"I thought the was nice,But the phone did not work went to the cricket store to have it turn on they told me it was not a cricket phone I email the person told them what was wrong they did not respond back I email them twice still nothing.This was a bad."	0
"I thought this phone did not measure up to the quality of the previous phone that I purchased from this seller. I did replace it with another phone, that I was thoroughly satisfied with, but I felt like the description of the phone in question could have been more informative.The phone that I replaced this one with was more expensive and I had to pay shipping to return the unwanted merchandiise. This ended up costing me a lot more money than I ever intended to spend. The seller was very accommodating but the added expense to me was made it a bad experience. I would shop with this seller again but only after more research on the product that I would be interested in purchasing."	0
"I thought this would be a cool phone. But it was garbage in the US and should have never been advertised to work with T-Mobil. It didn&apos;t and returned it! Also mine was a refurbished phone. as most seller are selling, which is not a big deal they just need to say that they are non usable in the US with any service and that you are going to need to return it. And be honest with your customers. Buyer Beware!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11"	0
I thought when I bought phone I would just put my sim card in phone and it would work. This phone is locked with password and seller unable to provide password. Phone is no good for me.I offered to return phone but she refuses to refund. I will never buy from someone who has only a few sales.	0

"I too had a problem with hearing when not using an ear-piece. That lasted until I discovered that I wasn&apos;t holding the sound output close enough to my ear input :-)    If you can&apos;t hear when not using an ear-piece, try moving the phone down, so that the top 1/2 inch of the phone is over your eardrum.    Pros:  -lightweight and slim  -No camera =&gt; definite plus for me  -Voice commands work well  -Bluetooth works well  -Contact phone# can be entered with password  -Battery life is good  -Shortcut keys can compensate for poor interface design  -Alarm works when phone is turned off    Cons:  In general, someone let the marketing geniuses get out of control. What better way to annoy your customers than to trick them into running up extra charges for services they don&apos;t want to use.    -Default setting for center button at top level is Internet connection and can&apos;t be altered.   -Poor documentation for basics - Nothing on how to enter passwords with phone numbers for contact entries. User Guide writers and/or their bosses forgot that this is a PHONE first, not a web browser or an organizer. No instructions about wired ear-piece anywhere in book.    -Ear-piece connection is proprietary. Yes it&apos;s 2.5mm. But a generic 2.5mm ear-piece will not work with it."	0
I took at chance with this seller because of the price . Shipping from Texas to Utah . Verizon phone to Cricket service. Was a smooth transition went to cricket dropped my Sims card in they put in a few codes . No money free 5mins boom new phone up and running . Great service fast shipping 3 days great packaging I would say I'm 1000% satisfied customer. Thank you. 	1
i took it to radio shack to get a card for it and the dealer told me that it had been dropped in water and it probably wasnt worth buying a card for. i bought it cause i wanted a camara phone and a flip phone. i wish i could just get my money back.	0
"I took some time to get  it,  the phone  very  nice,  The Apple Iphone 5s is in great condition . Well worth the money."	1
I took the phone to the Verizon store to activate it and transfer my number and files from my old phone. So it should work fine but the calendar and clock apps will not work. I would return the phone but I would be without a phone until you could ship another one.	0
"I totally dislike this phone.  The look of the phone is ok, however, I find it very heavy.  At the moment, I am having a lot of issues with it.  The back cover comes off every time I get it out of my case.  The phone calls get cut in the middle of the conversation.  It has very annoying noise at all times when I can communicate with others.  I have not been able to level the volume of either the microphone or the speaker, therefore, people can hardly hear me and I have to keep the phone away from my ear as I have to yell.  It doesn&apos;t come with instructions and the only language on the phone&apos;s games and features is Chinese, so I can not set them up because I can not read what it says.  I do not recommend this type of phones to anyone at all.  Maybe I just got the one with all this issues, but as of right now, I won&apos;t get another one of these items ever."	0
I totally love my note 4. My note 3 broke and upgraded to this one and I have no complains at all. Totally beats paying for an expensive one .	1
"I tried contacting this seller within the 14 Days warranty period that they claim they have, and received no response. I bought a Samsung Blackjack i607 and for some reason it will not read micro sd cards. In the description the phone was said to be working and that all was tested. Apparently not...so ALL buyers beware and make sure you test out everything you buy from this seller 100% because there is no warranty. The seller will just ignore your messages until after the 14 day warranty period passes."	0
"I tried other smart phones, and there is nothing like an iPhone. So far its the best phone on the market and there is truly no phone that beats it."	1
"I tried this phone out for about 5 months. I liked the fact that the screen was large and that the pictures were great. My previous Samsung camera phone took pictures that were pretty bad, and with this phone I didn&apos;t have to worry about quality. I also liked the video recording function.. HOpe this helped you all."	1
I tried to cancel a best offer that was placed by accident and has been ignoring my messages so worst customer service i have dealth with	0
I tried to install sim cards from both H2O and Cricket but was not able to either send nor receive phone calls.  Sending text messages and accessing internet was ok.  	0
I tried to order a device from them and never received it. They told me one price then kept emailing me about more money. I cancelled the order and asked for a refund back. And I haven't got my $300 back yet. Never gave me a legit tracking number. 	0
I tried to work with the seller directly all I tried to come to a peaceful Mutual understanding with my situation but now I'm going to let you know my recent experience with this seller.  Basically the phones listed as 9.5 to 10 which is Isaac we flawless but the phone that I received has a dent and it shows obvious signs of being very used a lot of dirt and grime in different areas. Now I contacted the seller and told him this and was willing to settle for a partial refund but the seller wouldn't agree to the amount I was asking so now I'm just going to send it back and he will give me a full refund but this is just a warning that the item is not as described so beware thank you.	0
I tried unlocked phone overseas (Ghana) but did not work. Unfortunately for me I am out of the country and I have not found a way to return the product. Right now it is of no use to me.	0
"I truly love this phone. It&apos;s been great so far. Would&apos;ve liked to have the manual or the original box, but that&apos;s fine. Thanks."	1
"I try contact but not answer , bought said that is unlocked but its NOT  !  "	0
"I try to like Sony phones. They're visually appealing, but the quality goes all to the Playstation. "	0
"I turn the phone on and there was a lockscreen with a photo of some girl im a red tank top, on the home screen behind the lock code. I simply emailed this seller and asked him what the lock code was. This seller emailed me back stating ""he factory reset the phone before sending it out and that he would be reporting me for playing games""  Obviously he did not factory reset the phone. I was able to look online and figure out how to actually factory reset the note 5 by resetting it and holding home/ volume up/ and power button. I tried to save myself the time by emailing the seller, but what an unprofessional response and then to threaten to report me because I simply asked a question about the phone. Not to mention, how ever he obtained the phone, if I knew how to hack a lock screen and if I was a criminal, I could have gotten all that girls information off her phone. So with that said NEVER SELL YOUR PHONE TO THIS SELLER!   No matter how well the deal is, I will NEVER buy from this seller again"	0
"I understand it is useless to contact eBay for buyer protection for this situation.  The tracking said it had been delivered, but my mail box was empty that day, and the next day. It never has been delivered. This is not the first time this situation happened to me."	1
"I understand that it is restored, but at least you should put real images of what you sell !!!"	0
"I understand that phones are treated rough, but if I had know I would not have bought this phone!  It is really damaged.  It is scratched all up.  It looks like it was run over with a car.  One edge of the phone is cracked. I am not going to complain, you get what you pay for."	0
"I upgraded after having the flip phone for 3 years... I like the style of this phone and the easy accessiblity.  I have as strong a signal now with this phone as I had with my flip phone with the antenna. I love my bluetooth ear headset. I read the very clear instructions on how to get it set. For a 56 year old woman, I did it all by myself. LOL The bluetooth feature and the style drew me to this phone.  I highly recommend this phone."	1
"I upgraded from an iPhone 4 to the 4S after comparing the pictures from each taken side by side. I couldn&apos;t believe how much better the camera was in the 4S.     I&apos;ve had it for a couple of weeks and I just love it. The battery life is close to the iPhone 4, but not quite as good.     I don&apos;t use Siri that much, so it was not a big motivator for me."	1
I upgraded from the Galaxy S2 to the S3 and I love them both.  the only thing about this one is that the battery life is even shorter in this one that with the S2.  Other than that I love it.	1
"I upgraded to this phone from another basic and was pleasantly surprised at how well I could read the screen, access features and hear.  I can&apos;t seem to get it to hook up to blu tooth but besides that, I love it."	1
"i use it as a back up phone,i use it as a back up phone,i use it as a back up phone,i use it as a back up phone,i use it as a back up phone,v,i use it as a back up phone,i use it as a back up phone"	1
"i use my phone for text,email and talk,and on all three fronts this phone delivers.great value for the price."	1
I use the phone like for tree days I liked the phone but I dont receive messages at all no good I want my money back please dont sell stuff sow expensive thats no good 	0
"I use the TouchPad, and love WebOS.  The problem is that the VEER seems to be pretty buggy still.  Freezes/runs out of memory daily.  The screen and keyboard are really too small to be useful to an &quot;old-guy&quot; like myself.  I got it for the 4G data speeds, which work great, and use the phone as a wireless router, when I&apos;m on the road, which is pretty seamless.      Wouldn&apos;t recommend buying one... except that you can pick them up for 100 bucks."	0
I use this phone on a day to day use for work and home business. The only flaw I can see with the unit is minor. The screen protectors included from CAT don't adhere to the screen correctly. I would recommend buying replacement protectors for a later time. 	1
"I use to love the Note 4 but I bought another one (bought as new) on 6/29/18 and I've had nothing but trouble with it. Powers off a lot, screen freezes, and battery won't charge to 100% unless I take battery out and put back in to get it to 100%. Contacted seller but he sent me a another battery but didn't change at all. Did a factory reset because I couldn't do a screen shot either. I can take screen shots now, but nothing has gotten better. Seller wasn't any help about phone at all. My first and LAST time I ever pay from ebay. I'm done with phone and this site."	0
"I used it for three days and rebooted it, now it's bricked out. I have to redo the firmware on it now, since the phone was made for the United Arab Emirates. I went back to my old phone and when I have time to redo the firmware, I will give this to my son. "	0
"I used one month Suck it, Struck always, some time cant get call, its restarting, some time no signal, heat very high"	0
"I used the Motorola V60i for about a year. I had absolutely no problems with the phone. It had good reception in my area(the boondocks of Virginia). It does come with a few cool features like the calculator, tone composer which was pretty cool once I bought a program online to make the tones, changeable face plates, voice memo/record, voice calling, and a datebook. All of those used to be cool when the phone came out. Now, you can find much better phones with much more features. If you are not currently using this phone, I do not recommend buying it. As I said, there are much more better phones now. This phone is now outdated."	0
I used the unlock phone with metro pcs...i don't get any of my calls and it takes over 45seconds for the phone to actually ring when you hit call....i have troubleshooted every possible  with metro techs and nothing works	0
"I Used this phone a LONG time ago, and it was always fun to use. It had a cool camera, and fun phone to text on, and was durable. I smacked it on the asphalt accidentally, when I jumped and it fell out of my front pocket *gulp* and it was seperated on the side, but put it all back together and it turned on and worked as it was designed. it was a very good phone."	1
"I used this phone, Sony Ericsson Vivaz, one week. The battery was very poor. 1/2 day of normal use, and it was empty.  This was a phone I expected much moore from, so I was very disappointed . Earlier I only used Sony Ericsson, but now it will only be Samsung."	0
"I used to be an iPhone user, however, after getting used to Blackberry Torch I can only say it is parallel to nothing I ever used. It is a 100% business phone and with limitless capabilities and reliability. I could not pinpoint a minus point. It is safe and with friendly interface. One has to learn to use its capabilities.  I travelled with it many countries and its data support is strong and its platform is adaptable to any network with utmost speed.  Its address book and calendar is compatible with Mac or PC, therefore, synchronization is easy and automatic.  Very highly recommended!"	1
"I used to have the Curve; switched to the Bold.  It&apos;s just the right size.  Nice keyboard; wasn&apos;t like the Blackberry Curve keyboards.  Amazing camera quality; bright flash.  Not enough apps though, but that&apos;s any Blackberry for you.  I would recommend this phone over the Curve any day."	1
"I usually like Nokia phones. This is a cute and unique phone, but it was defective. The seller was professional, and gave me no problems getting a refund."	0
I very much enjoyed the purchase of this device. The seller went the extra mile and meet me with the delivery of the device. Thanks.	1
"I waited almost 2 weeks, still had not gotten the item I had paid for. Very disappointing. This has been the worst transaction I&apos;ve ever done on ebay.  ***Here is the kicker!!!! The guy just sent me a message telling me the item he sold me, HE NO LONGER HAD!!!!***"	0
I waited so long to get this phone I am a huge blackberry fan. And now it's powered by android which I love! Battery could be better though but it lasts longer than apple lol love it 	1

I want to return the items. but when I review the description he said good physical and working operation. on the lower part he said might not working in any kind of carrier... he said might working if flashed something on configuration but I don&apos;t have any idea on how to do that.... he said he don&apos;t accept return and he will defend on case.... its my fault.. I messed up my money with this kind of items....	0
i want to say thank you to ebay i was just looking to the things the i buy thru ebay and i find out the phone showing in the picture its different to the one that the seller send me	0
I want to thank the seller. The phone is almost brand new. Everything was correct that he wrote to the description. Dependable seller. Good experience. Satisfied shopping.  	1
I wanted a blackberry because I can  check my e-mail and it looks good.  I bought it  because  it is  not so  expensive for me.  thanks	1
I wanted a easy smart phone. This phone is easy to learn and easy to navigate. The only downside is battery life.	1
"I wanted a phone that was small enough to carry in my pants pocket without being conscious that it was there.  This phone is just that.  The fact that it is a little thicker than most phones (to me) is a positive thing not a negative.  When I grip my phone in my hand I like to feel that I have a hold of something solid.  The muted green colour is comfortable to the eye and a refreshing change from black.  At first, I had a little problem with the side buttons activating in my pocket but after installing a thin TPU case I no longer have that problem.  In all, this is an excellent phone and I would recommend it to any one.  Hope Sony keeps making  more like it. "	1
"I wanted a slide phone that would allow me to text easier as well as be able to receive photos and use the internet.  However, this phone was from a company based in mexico and therefor could not connect to the internet.  It also did not allow for picture messages and other basic functions.  This phone was definitly NOT worth the $70 I paid for it.  It uses very old technology and has very limited capabilites.  The only function it did perform as promised, was have a functionable keyboard that allowed me to text easier.  I am now using my old phone again.  I would never purchase it again or recommend it to anyone.  Thank you."	0
"I wanted a touch screen phone. This one is way too sensitive. Its hard to touch just the specific key or name you want. I am forever backing out of things. I do not like that I can not shut off my ringer at night and just have the alarm on. Other phones I have owned I could do that. The keyboard is nice because some touch screens dont have one but its too sensitive and small for my fingers. The picture quality is nice and it records video as well which is nice, My other phone didnt do video. The sound isnt very good when I put a memory card in to play mp3&apos;s. The battery life is unbelievable though! All in all I would chosen a different phone! Not a good phone if you text alot or talk alot!"	0
I wanted an LG K8 I went to best buy and bought one went home with it when I unpackaged the Phone it was a nightmare the screen was flickering when I wanted to turn it off it would not let me..Had a very bad screen sad..:(.. because the phone was nice looking I had to drive about 25 miles back to Best Buy to get a full refund on it..I showed them the phone when I got there and told them what it was doing they saw it with their own eyes the phone was not good sad..:(..They asked me if I wanted to buy another phone and I said no..Unbelievable how some electronics are no good and they sell them before even checking them out first.. sad..:(..Well I went to Walgreens and bought me a Samsung Galaxy J1 instead much better price and it's a very good little phone..I'm sharing my bad experience I had with this phone. 	0
"I wanted an unlocked android smartphone that didn&apos;t cost a fortune with the features, GPS,Video,8MP camera, internet that runs fast and smooth. It came with the Android 2.1 Operating System which is older now but operates effeciently. Very good product for the price."	1
"I wanted it but my carrier metro, said it was locked. Luv it, though sorry!"	1
"I wanted the phone because I liked it, but I paid for it on August 4 and today Sept. 3 and I still have not received it. I will not buy from him again because he does not consider his buyers."	0
I wanted this phone for a while. I owned a dare at the time i purchased it. I received mt tax check and impulse bought it.	1

"I wanted to return item and I am being told there is no way to have UPS cancel delivery and return the item, however, UPS informed me that only the sender (the seller) can make such a request to have the item returned while in transit. I am not able to refuse delivery as I am not at the designated address."	0
I warn everyone not to work with that guy. He is a big scammer nothing more and wouldn&apos;t respond to any emails.	0
I was a little apprehensive about buying a touch screen LG however the responsive time is way better then an LG touch phone released to date. The camera sucks even though it is a 3.0 MP. FM radio works great and it is easy to personalize. I do have to say that I am disappointed but the service I received from the seller. I bought for digikarma because they had lots of positive reviews and only a hand full of negatives unfortunately I had a not so great experience. I order a pink LG KP500 on 06/16/2009 and PAID for shipping to received the phone in 3-4 business days and it took 8 days to actually received the phone however I got the bonus antenna booster in 3 days. Ha Ha. I emailed them and got a prompt response but what really upset me is that I never received a shipping number for my phone just the antenna booster till I emailed them. Not only that they sent me a SILVER KP500 when I ordered a PINK and I don&apos;t have the time to wait possibly two weeks to return and have a new one shipped because my other phone broke and need it on me because of family emergencies. I feel like I got played a little bit. This was my first time buying on Ebay and I was so stressed that I got screwed from this transaction that I will never do it again.	0
I was a little impatient in waiting for the phone as I didn't have one (the one I had just quit working). But it was worth the wait. I love the phone and it's features. I'm glad I ordered the gold platinum. I was afraid it was going to be too gold but it is a very pretty phone. It arrived in mint condition and works great. I am very happy with my purchase!	1
"I was a little worried about buying this phone at first because it&apos;s an older model but I got more than what I expected out of it! I really do love it, and my fiance&apos; just purchased one too because he liked mine so much! The battery life is great, very good clarity during phone calls, service is not a problem. It is kind of bulky but a good phone case makes that not a problem. The camera only zooms in once but the pictures turn out pretty good. I LOVE the touchscreen and keypad. All in all it&apos;s a great phone! I definitely recommend it!"	1
"I was a little worried when it said ""Used"" and may have wear and tear appearance. Not the case, this phone looked new. It works perfectly fine and the battery holds a good charge. "	1
I was able to return the phone after it was damaged during delivery.  Seller offered replacement or refund.	1
I was afraid is going to be one of those lemons and took the chance. I don't regret it at all. Good value 	1
I was buying a phone from this seller. and 4 days later he tell me he dont have it . poor work from the seller.	0
I was counting on getting this phone for my granddaughters birthday. I won the auction and paid immediately. This was on Saturday and he said he would ship Monday. Still not shipped on Tuesday and then cancelled order with no explanation 	0
"I was deceived. The phone never turned on since I first received it. It looked nice, but functionally, just a block. I tried everything I can do, including hard keys combo, original charger, original cable, but everything failed. I have no ways to return this item 'cause I'm not in US, and therefore have no ways to have refund. Sorry for this serious review, but this is true."	0
"I was disappointed  , When receive and I brought to US Cellular to activated it, I was informed that it was NOT NEW,  my original model looked better that the""new"" one.  I did get my money refunded, but appropriate marketing information would have saved a lot of time and effort "	0
I was disappointed that there was someone else name engraved on the back of the phone. The phone is decent for its price but just know that you will have to pay 35$ for a new battery immediately. 	0
I was disappointed with this product. There was numerous issues regarding the appearance of the phone. But the seller is giving me a refund.	0
"I was dis-hearted after buying the mobile because when i recieved it was fine but after 2,3 it stops working and when i contact with seller he/she didnt replay well and i lost 30 pounds.Now i dont want to buy anything from ebay"	0

I was extremely disappointed it said it was unlocked and is not I am having a horrible time in Canada trying to get this phone unlocked and able to work horrible value for the money	0
"I was extremely happy with this product.  The description was perfect.  Both phones work great.  Both ESN&apos;s were clear.  All funcions of both phones work.  I decided to buy it because I was looking for a new phone for myself because my was breaking.  My boyfriend wanted a different one and this price was perfect.  The shipping was amazing, I blinking and they had it to me.    The battery&apos;s are still in excellent condition.  This was a great buy!!"	1
"i was given a refund, but i really wanted the phone"	0
"I was happy when I received the cell phone. But, when charging and turning it on, the screen does not work to the touch. Take it to a store to verify. The technician managed to open the screen and in addition to having touch problem, to surprise is also blocked with a Samsung account. To fix it, you have to invest about $ 270. Not counting the $ 160 that cost me plus $ 11 of shipping. Very bad experience and loss of money. I previously bought cell phones on Ebay, it's the first time this has happened to me. I can not talk about the Galaxy S6 because I can not use it unfortunately ... I hope to buy another one for a better review. I'm interested in the Galaxy S6. "	0
"I was hesitant to get a used or refurbished phone, but this phone has been great.  Much better than my S5 which it replaced.  Fast service and delivery."	1
I was highly disappointed that this phone came without a charger or a battery! And no place carries this battery!!	0
"I WAS I LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT ORDERING A HIGH END NOKIA ALL THE WAY FROM CHINA, HOWEVER THIS MERCHANT AND THE EUROPEAN NOKIA 6600S SLIDER,FAR EXCEEDED MY EXPECTATIONS. HAPPYGO WAS A DELITE TO DEAL WITH AND PROFESSIONAL IN EVERY ASPECT OF OUR TRANSACTION. I WAS TOLD UP FRONT THE PHONE COULD TAKE 10-15 DAYS TO ARRIVE FROM CHINA AND I WAS SHOCKED WHEN THE US POSTAL SERVICE SHOWED UP AT MY OFFICE WITH THE ITEM IN ONLY 3 DAYS !!! VERY PROFESSIONAL EBAYER !! THE PHONE IS ELEGANT AND A DELITE TO USE.IT IS AN ELEGANT NOKIA FASHION PHONE MADE FOR THE EUROPEAN MARKET AND NOT AVAILABLE FROM U.S.RETAILERS.  IT CAME WITH SOFTWARE AND  MANUALL FOR THE US AND ALL ACCESSORIES (new in the factory box for 1/3 the normal price). I HAVE CONECTED THIS PHONE TO MY IBM W700 GOLIATH MOBILE WORK STATION AND WITH THE NOKIA PC SOFTWARE AND THE USB CABLE IT CAME WITH I WAS ON THE INTERNET USEING THE PHONE AS A MODEM IN A MATTER OF MINUTES. I WILL SOON BE SHOPPING THIS DELITEFUL EBAYERS STORE AGAIN. atmeddy6233"	1
"I was impressed with the timely manner in which it was  shipped. It was in even better condition than stated. I would recomend this company highly and not hesitate to purchase from them in the future.  The only 2 things I don&apos;t like about the phone, which was not the sellers fault, is it&apos;s very (sometimes impossible) to see in the out of doors and the ringer isn&apos;t loud enoug for me. I worked in a factory for 33 yrs and I have some hearing problems."	1
"I was in for this product due to music quality of Sony and its updatability to ICS. After almost a month of use, I find following + and - &amp;gt;&amp;gt;  (Plus 1): Phone is ok for those moving from legacy OS to Android.    (Minus 5): Phone is dead slow at times. Basic operations like making calls often become tedious.  (Minus 1): Sony is still not giving ICS upgrade - and no easy to find news about that upgrade.  (Minus 1): Phone internal memory is unacceptably low. You realize it within 2 to 4 weeks.  (Minus 1): SD card of 1 GB is big pain. You can buy a new one but you can hardly transfer anything from this 1 GB to new card. Sony support is PATHETIC and MISLEADING as they are not aware whats there on 1 GB standard shipped card.  (Minus 1): Buying a new card is additional cost which adds to phone cost as compared to other phone.  (Minus 1): Headphone provided by Sony are average and not comparable to best in class.     So overall dissatisfied. I would rather suggest new buyers to go for other options."	0
I was in need of a phone quickly since my previous phone was damaged. The pricing was reasonable and the condition of the item was decent. I am pleased with the purchase as far as the performance and condition of the phone.	1
I was interested in this bid cause it was one plus 3t but when it arrive found out it's a one plus 3 not 3t and t mobile doesn't work on it. Everytime I tried to Google something it said no internet connection. When I contacted him he was kind of annoyed and saying why didn't you check before buying if TMobile works on this. This is so old phone but he is pretending as it's new . I returned the item with my money. Don't buy it .	0
"I was loocking for a new replacement phone,but I didn&apos;t want to sign up for another 2 year contract to get a &quot;free&quot; phone. When I saw this unit I thought it would be an unexpensive way to get a replacement phone without incurring in any compromise with my phone carrier;my economic situation is far from good because of many issues. When I got the phone,I was surprised of its very good condition! I&apos;m using it since day one and I am pretty satisfied with the seller and the smoth transaction.There&apos;s nothing I dislike of this phone.And I like the fact that is an unit that works with my carrier only.I&apos;ve heard that those so called &quot;unlocked&quot; units do not work 100% properly, because each carrier has its own features. I can tell you that I found what I was looking for."	1
"i was looking at the samsung freeform and was wondering can you get it on the pageplus plan cuz thats what my plan is, but i want the phone just want too hook it up with my plan if i can. so please email me back and let me know if im able too. thanks:)"	1
"I was looking for a confortable and modern phone, and i really like the Nokia cellphones, so, when i saw this item with that very low price, y just could&apos;t say no. It&apos;s an excelent phone, as good as i spected, and the sellet gived to me a fast response, i&apos;m so thankfull with him, he is a Great eBay seller."	1
I was looking for a mobile phone that had good communication ability in rural &amp; remote Australia on the Next-G network &amp; found that the ZTE F165 was the best model to meet most of the requirements.  My biggest problem with other Next-G phones was the poor range distance signal these other models could achieve where the ZTE F165 easily outdistanced all of them.  When used in conjunction with an external aerial the range is greatly improved also.  The phone has a loud ring tone &amp; the keypad is easily defined.   This model Next-G phone is now hard to find in new condition in Australia as superseded models have been found not to to be as good.  Battery life is good.	1
"I was looking for a phone and a friend told me about ebay so I decided to look at them at ebay because she told me that ebay was trustwothy and so I bought a Sony Ericsson T610 (T-mobile)and the seller had on his page the description of the phone and it seemed as the phone was in good conditions but it was used so I decided to buy it and when it arrived the phone didnt turn on so in other words the phone didnt work and he just took my money and sent me a phone that didnt work. I was very disappointed because I didnt think that anything like that would happen so the phone was pretty and everything but what can I get with a pretty phone that doesnt work...so I would have to think about it twice before buying something worth so much like that agian and also depending on the seller that has alot to do...Overall, I would recommend that you see carefully what you buy because eventhough the description may say that the phone is in good conditions you must also have good communication with the seller because they wont loose anything you are going to be the one loosing your money."	0
"i was looking for a phone that didn,t flip and tried this one and it is so SMALL! the numbers were little and the 0 was on bottom of phone, this phone is for teens., the sound was very poor when you talked to people, i could hardly hear on it, when you put it up to your ear it was so small , i didn,t like this phone at all!"	0

"I was looking for a simple bar phone, but this thing was pretty crappy  Poor reception means continuous ""No Signal"" indicator  Non-intuitive features makes it hard to use (do I really have to call my own number to check my voicemail)  10 out of 10 would not recommend  "	0
"I was looking for a unlocked nokia cell phone    I liked that the phone was unlocked    The thing I didn&apos;t like was that the listing on ebay said that the phone was refurbished and when i received the phone, it was a used phone and contained scratches on the flip. I had to write to the seller three times, asking him to replace the used phone he sold me and i had to pay a second time for shipping."	0

"I was looking for the best value to add time to my Tracfone and I liked the plans that were good for a year. I found this package deal for the LG Treasure and 1350 minutes, 1350 texts, and 1350 megabytes of data for $79.95. The card to add time and minutes to my old phone was $99.95 for the one year plan and it only came with 1200 minutes and 1200 texts. This was a great deal and the LG Treasure is a great phone. It is larger than my old phone which is great for an old man and has all the features that my wife's phone from the big carrier has. Thank you Tracfone! "	1
I was looking for what i already had and this was just like it.. it has worked perfect with no problems	1
"I was looking under the Cricket wireless phones and came across the Blackberry world edition. I bought the phone thinking that it was for Cricket services and the picture showed a nice phone, with a disclaimer that it was used. Being new to e-bay I though that what was shown was what I would of received. Instead, I received a SPRINT wireless phone, the condition of the phone was definitely roughed up, and then while trying to charge the battery to see if it would work, NO BATTERY! I missed that small information at the bottom of the screen. That was my fault but the batteries are not cheap and they would take 7-14 business day to be received, putting me past the return police. I would of liked to be informed upfront that I would need a battery.I need to check if the phone even works and check if SPRINT phones can be used as a CRICKET phone.I don&apos;t know what to do because I can&apos;t even check if the phone works because I can&apos;t turn it on.help! And I was so excited to be getting a nice used phone. I do recognize that this is both buyer and sellers fault  ~Jodhe"	0
"I was more than happy with my purchase, there was a &quot;scratch&quot; on the scroll pad, it turned out to be the protective film that was still on there. I removed the film, and the phone was brand new again. I would most definitely send someone to this seller for a phone purchase."	1
I was nervous at first but now Im forever grateful and thankful for the seller. I've had it for about 3 weeks and it came looking like it was never used or touched.The phone is fantastic no issues whatsoever. i do live in the same state as the seller and i revived my phone really fast i believe within 3 days. no regrets easy purchase and no hidden or strings were attached 	1
I was never able to use it or turn it on the sim card was no good! I tryed several times to have it turned on online for my 6 yr old but everytime i typed in the sim card number it came bac as no good unable to use that sim card! so as of today it sits in my drawer. if you can send me a new sim card that would be  nice thank yo	0
I was not able to get the phone powered on  although I did charge it. Once I used another charger it got a little charge enough to power on but would not stay on. We had to purchase a new battery which we just receive so we are still trying to see if the price is worth the aggravation. Also it is an extremely old version so it is extremely slow. It also uses the bigger sim card and my sim card is the micro 	0

I was not happy with my new Nokia 6103. The reception is very bad.  The outer finish on the phone has already wore off.  This new phone was a nightmare to transfer all the old phone # from the old phone to the new one.  I think I&apos;ll up-grade to the newer phones out.	0
I was not happy with the condition that the phone was in. It was very beat up and worn down. I did not know the phone looked like this when I purchased it. The picture shown was of a brand new phone so it was very misleading.	0
"I was not impresssed with the phone.  The seller states the phone is ""Brand New"", however the phone did not require updating.  A Brand New phone out of the box will always require updating.  The phone has issues.  It will stop working at times.  It will go back to the home screen when trying to open yahoo mail.  The ringtone and notification sounds keeo going back to the default sounds when I restart the phone.  "	0
I was not satisfied so I returned it but the seller did not refund my money till date.It was of very low quality.	0
I was not sure that this was the phone that I was looking for. When I recieved it I was shocked it was the one I was looking for. thank you.	1

"I was only a little hesitant about buying a new phone on E-Bay because of possible problems. The LG V10 is plagued with problems that aren't easy to fix even if your good at it. I finally found a seller I was comfortable buying from and a great price, the phone however was a dud, problems started when downloading apps, they constantly stopped before I could even get into them, the phone locked on the lock screen with a VPN error and I couldn't even get into the phone until I spent money for a professional to spend 2hrs trying to get in to reset it. Thanks to choosing the right seller I was able to return the phone hassle free, Better Deals 123 was awesome to deal with and they took care of it, I bought a new phone but the phone itself has issues I didn't know about until I started researching the problem, then I found out the V10 has various software problems that LG is not addressing. I would buy from Better Deals 123 again for outstanding customer service. Thank you Bob"	0
I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this product. It looked and performed like it was BRAND NEW out of the box.  Would highly recommend this seller to buyers!	1
I was pleased at first but later found the phone to be cumbersome and slow to react. It never recognized my passwords as my old phone did and could not pick up wifi anywhere wish I could return it.	0
"I was pleased when I bought this phone at ehat seemed like a barging price, after i got received the phone i realized that I could not use the features on the phone because it is a international phone that does not work right in the US when i contacted the seller they did not respond to me so now im stuck with this phone plus i need to buy a new one."	0
"I was promised a T-Mobile phone, and I have a SK Telecomm service phone. You can't unlock it. I paid almost $400, and the seller KNEW about this as per them and did not tell me until I sent them a question as to what's going on with it on Sunday night. Here is what the seller told me...   New message from: better_buys_here2006  Top Rated Seller(18,957YellowShooting Star) I became aware of this over the weekend. I assume my supplier got my T-Mobile order got mixed up,with someone elses order. I will speak to him Monday and find out what is going on. I will keep you posted. I apologize for the inconvenience"	0
"I was real pleased that I didn&apos;t have to wait and bid on the Samsung SGH A437 (AT&amp;T).  I was able to &quot;buy now&quot; at a reasonable price, which was real nice because my husband is an OTR truck driver and was robbed at gun point and the robber took his phone. This phone was exactually like the one that was stolen.  All the features were like the camera, address book, calendar etc were real simple to maneur.  The added car plug was nice too.  It was like a free present. Everyone likes free stuff. lol  ATT wouldn&apos;t cover the phone which we think was horrible business pratice and this wasn&apos;t the first time that ATT wouldn&apos;t cover one of our phones.  My husband was quit upset over the whole deal and was so happy when he got home to see a phone waiting for him."	1
"I was really impressed when I opened the first iPhone 5s as the condition and the screen was in amazing condition.  I was extremely disappointed with the second phone, body was beat up and the screen was burnt across the top portion of the screen.  Didn't take a picture of the screen as I sent this in for a trade in program.  Really hope it doesn't get rejected or this will end up costing me over $500"	0

"I was replacing an old LG VX3200 cell phone that had a very short battery life (2 hrs. talk time &amp; 3 days max on standby) and this Motorola W385 ranked fairly high on several electronic review sites.  What they said was true - talk time averages about 4 hours and, even better, standby time is approximately 15 days.  The phone&apos;s heavier than I expected but it is durable and sturdy and easy handle.  Set up was a breeze and while I wasn&apos;t looking, or in need, of a bunch of &apos;bells &amp; whistles&apos; this phone has enough to make the average user happy."	1
"I was scared of buying this at first then I grew a pair and bought it mostly because it had a 30-money back, but it's beautiful. I don't normally write reviews but this is a special occasion. Thanks man "	1
I was sent a email saying it was shipped I should receive it Oct 3 2018 it is Oct 10 2018 I have not got it yet . The seller said it is on back order ???? Why not tell me that then what is i want to cancel 	0

"I was skeptical at buying the Mate 8 due to the numerous mixed reviews about this Chinese version phone. I bought the NXT-DL00 model. This is my experience. The phone is a new open box. When it arrived I turned it on and after setting up wifi it wanted to update right away. I clicked ok and 45 minutes later Marshmallow with EMU 4.1 was installed. I clicked on the Hiapp icon (Chinese version App Store) and downloaded 4 programs: Google Play, G Mail, Google Contacts Sync and Google Calendar Sync. Once installed I had to go into the phones apps manager and tweak the permissiopns for the 4 apps to work. Finally the US Google play worked great. I was able to install Google Keyboard, Google search, Google Maps and all the other programs I am used to using on my phones. I uninstalled as much of the Chinese bloatware as possible and disabled/force stopped those that would not uninstall. Wow, I am so impressed and happy with this phone. The Internet is very fast on the AT&T network, everyday functions are fast and the screen is beautiful. I was coming from the Note 4 and the bigger screen, longer battery life and faster processor made this a really nice upgrade For me. I had to change the SIM card to a nano size because the Note 4  sim card was too big. AT&T was great and does this for fr"	1
"I was so excited to find the phones for my children for Christmas. When they came instead of being NEW like the information said. They where refurbished. I wanted to keep them, but the QWERTY key boards didn&apos;t work all the time on either phone plus NO INSTRUCTION book and only one charger came with two phones then when it came to pic&apos;s the phone took terrible pictures plus even though they where compatible for AT&amp;T phone service I could not receive my full AT&amp;T service because they where not AT&amp;T phones. So sadly to say I had to send them back."	0
I was so excited to get the phone but when I plugged it up I cant use it its stuck on ememrgency calls only this phone should have been checked before it was sent out im very disappointed	0

I was so satisfied with my purchase I just had to leave this seller a review.  My purchase was shipped the same day.  I received it on time.  The Item was in better condition then described.  The purchase was Perfect.  Thank you very much.	1
"I was sold a corporate phone which was never mentioned in Ad that cant be unlocked. I was told this by AT&T.  It also has very, very poor battery life. This was a replacement for my old HTC One which had a much better battery life than this one.  I tried to use with sims in Vietnam and Myanmar, but it wouldn't accept any codes..  I am past return date now,  so I'm stuck with a phone that I bought for a feature that doen't work!"	0

"I was surprised how good of condition the phone is in. No dings or scratches, practically looking new. "	1
"I was terriably disappointed in this item. It was advertised as &quot;Mint&quot; &quot;excellent condition&quot;. It is scratched up like it&apos;s been worn in a pocket with sand, inside &amp; outside of the phone. I am NOT happy with my purchases. Thank you."	0
"I was the unlucky one to have ordered this phone!  I originally had a pink one which lasted me for years and I loved it. It was purchases from a phone store.  This one in blue lasted me two weeks and now I am trying to reach the seller to resolve this issue.  People were complaining that they could not hear me and it sounded like I was &quot;underwater&quot;.  Volume control also did not work.  I have now had this phone approximately five weeks and never got any resolution from anyone on how to proceed.  Had to go out yesterday and buy a working phone.  So far I am out $79.99 plus $24.99 for warranty.  DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PHONE!  Even with a warranty, I still had no resolution as of yet.  I need someone to respond to my emails soon.  Help!"	0
I was told it was new and it was packaged as new but after a week the keys on the right side stopped working as well as the back arrow..	0
I WAS TOLD THAT THE PHONE WAS 14.99 BUT WHEN I PAID FOR THE PHONE AND REQUESTED A TRACKING NUMBER THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY DIDN&apos;T MEAN TO PUT THAT PRICE UP THERE. I THINK THAT THAT&apos;S FALSE ADVERTISING. I WAS VERY ANGER. I WASN&apos;T THE ONLY ONE THAT PAID FOR ONE OF THE PHONES. IT WASN&apos;T MY FAULT THAT YOU DIDN&apos;T TAKE ENOUGH TIME TO LOOK OVER YOUR WORK. HOW DO YOU GET 14.99 FROM 289.00 DOLLARS THIS ISN&apos;T RIGHT I STILL SHOULD BE ENTITLED TO MY PHONE. THIS WAS VERY STUPID OF THEM.	0
i was totally satisfied. i got a quick delivery and da best part was dat i unlocked it myself....so i knew da fone was new and untouched... i decided to but it cos it was cheaper dan da rest of da blackberry torch on ebay	1
I was unable to use the phone as it was a CDMA phone and had no sim card provision. We ue GSM 900 in our country and so it could not work.  The seller howver refunded me the money. I would advise that the right specifications are given as ebay buyers are from worldwide.	0
I was unable to use the product because the security code could not be found. I took the phone to AT&amp;T and they were unable to locate a security code. They told me the phone was useless.	0
I was under the impression from the picture and the details that this phone came with a $45 unlimited straight talk plan as well as a activation chip setup. I only received the phone and the chip not the straight talk card. Seller was unable to accommodate. He did not want to resolve the issue just simply stated if you dont like it send the phone back. 	0
I was updated on where my phone was and was reminded a few days before it arrived it would be here soon. Great phone.	1
I was very apprehensive about buying a used iPhone from eBay but I didn't have to worry!  This was a great purchase replacing a broken iPhone 5 for my son.  The item was in better condition than expected - there were no scratches or any defects that I could see.  It also came sooner than expected - I ordered on 12/18 and it came to me on 12/22.   I would 100% purchase again from this seller.	1
I was very disappointed with the phone that I had bought. within a month the screen went to all white . Iprobally will not recommend people to buy on ebay. I think the phone should have lasted longer than one month! very DISAPPOINTED!!!	0
I was very disappointed.  I purchased this phone with the belief that I was going to receive this phone with a working battery and a stylus pen. I contacted the saler and he promised to send me a stylus pen and a working battery. It has been two months now and the saler still has not sent me these items.  I have contacted the saler several times and he continues to ignore my request.  I have a phone now that is useless.	0

I was waiting for the day that tmobile would release an lg phone. REALLY. Anyway the phone is pretty cool. next to my old voyager they&apos;re almost identical. I have a tmobile backup prepaid nokia 1661 which i love a lot. So i will not switch but it is a good phone	1
I was worried about this phone because it wasn&apos;t a flip.  But come to find out it was a VERY solid phone.  I was impressed with the quality of calls and the features it includes.	1

"I wasted money for this junk phone . This phone is bad. Getting incoming call, I hit call button and too slow to hear far end talking.Battery is ok . Windows mobile 6.1 is a junk . Who likes smart phone then should buy endroid, but never ever buy Motorola with Motoblur, if they do not want to pay a ton of sms ... I d not know why people can say this phone is cool . Look closely it appears fake ."	0
I wear hearing aids and doing research on the internet I found that the Pantech Slate was rated for T-coil hearing aids.  I&apos;m very happy with my purchase but not for that reason only.  This is a very nice phone with numerous features and slim style as well as the qwarty keyboard (which I love).  The only downside is that I can&apos;t add a memory card. Other than that I can do everything on this phone that I could with my BlackBerry....only hear better!	1
I went from iPhone 6 to S5 galaxy. It is slow.   Service is terrible. Maps loses it's signal every couple miles.	0

I went to go get it turned on &amp; after sitting in the store for 30 minutes trying to figure out the error I was told you sold me a jailbroke phone. &amp; not only did I spend 219 for this jailbroke phone but i also have to pay more money to send the phone back.

"I went to the AT&T store they connected on 4/4 2017 and I try to turned on again today Friday and didn't turn on. I would appreciate to have one that works or my money back, please.    Which one can be done? If exist there is a sincere good will here in eBay to resolve anything..."	0
I went to try to use this device on an independent carrier and they gave me a cell number and everything was suppose to be set.  It wasn't so they transferred me to their tec support and they informed me that the device was too old to work on the new 3G and 4G network that AT&T uses.  So now I have a cell phone to no where.  	0
"I will be returning the phone. NOTHING AT ALL BAD AGAINST THE SELLER! Was in the condition described. However, when I was deciding to buy this phone it said it was Wi-fi capable and etc....it is NOT. It has absolutely no Apps or any way to add Apps. No Google Play store. Has no internal storage at all, requires memory card for all. And the text keyboard is like the old school flip phone dial pad, you have to hit &quot;5&quot; twice to get the letter &quot;k&quot; and etc. No word fill or any of that. Nothing more than an old school flip phone made to look fancy as a touchscreen. Do not get this phone! Unless you are getting it as a starter phone for a child, then it would probably be perfect! They definitely couldn&apos;t be online with it at all lol."	0
"I will be unable to write a positive review for this product, as the item that I have received looked like that it was not a genuine one:   a) it was practically impossible to remove the back cover from the phone;   b) instruction manual enclosed was printed on a low quality paper with several important pages missing in the beginning and no illustrations;   and b) specifications presented in the listing mismatched the real ones listed on other sites covering LG GD570."	0
I will definitely purchase from this gentleman again and probably will soon thanks  	1
I will give you 5 Stars.	1
"I will NEVER buy a phone from ebay again. First off, the buyer makes you pay $9 for priority shipping, that would be okay if they package ACTUALLY came in two days. I still have yet to recieve my phone, and for a second I thought I was getting scammed because I was unable to track the package for a few days. My advice is if you need a new phone because your phone broke or you want another one, just get a replacement phone from your carrier or don&apos;t be cheap and buy a phone from your carrier with a new plan. WORST ONLINE PURCHASE EVER."	0
I will never buy from bluedot.net again I bought a phone from them and it was bad they sent me a second phone for me as a replacement and it was worse than the first one and real poor communication  on there  part made for a real bad experience .	0

"I will stay on the Droid 4 until the OS no longer supports it or there are no new Droid 4s left. This is my 3rd Droid 4, the previous were replaced for the same issue: after 2 years of use, the touch screen (digitizer) stops working! =(  The 1st droid was used, but only a few months old, the 2nd one was refurbished, and have extra software hiccups than the 1st one! So glad I did not buy another refurbished because this NEW Dorid 4 does not have those extra  software hiccups (texting and it will suddenly pull up the dial screen -the 2nd one had multiple software hiccups beyond that).   Of course, compared to the phones of today, the battery has a short life, is a brick, but I much rather have spent the $100 on this than $500 or more on a newer phone, even the Blackberry Prive couldn't pry that much money from my hands!

i will use again 	1

"I won the auction and paid for the item either that same day or the following. and this was Mid-August. It is now Mid-September and I am still waiting for the item i won and paid for in full.  I dont know if its a scam or the individual who is selling the item is just taking her sweet time to send the item to me.  Either way, that is not how I do business and I do not recommend doing business with anyone that operates this way."	0

"I won the bid July 5. I received the phone July 10. It came with battery BT60, which did not fit properly. I notified you that my ATT store said it needed a BT50. You said that you would send correct battery. On July 17, I again notified you that I had not received the replacement battery you said you would send it fedex overnight. I contacted you again on July 23, and you said you would send the battery and some accessories as an apology for the screw up.  I received the replacement batteries on July 25 and no accessories, BUT you sent 2 batteries that were not the correct size. I went on line and bought the correct battery from another seller and notified you about another incorrect shipment. You said you would reimburse me for the purchase, and you did.   The cell phone was as you advertised, but your slow shipments and battery screw ups have left me quite disatisfied with your product services."	0
"I won the note 8 during an auction, paid for it, then 2 days later the seller cancelled my order. Yes I received my money back, but was very disappointed that the seller reneged on the sale. If I'm not allowed to welsh on an auction, then neither should the seller. Not trust worthy. I guess they found someone who would pay them more! "	0

I sent him an email asking him when he will ship my item and he never responded.

This seller is not a good seller, dont trust."	0
"I won this item on March 30. On April 6, I sent in inquiry and was told by  jennifer James that she got a new job and this had slipped her mind.

I can understand one delay but I don&apos;t believe this is reasonable."	0

I work in the mobile industry and purchased this phone for testing purposes.  USB support ended up being nearly non-existent so I was unable to use the phone as intended.  The device itself is unimpressive but fine.	0
I would advice you all not to buy from this criminal they are crooks and will tell you they send your item and you never get it. it was a waste of my money. stay away ppl  stay away. THis is from Olanquan Fashion Magazine and we approve this feed back 	0
I would buy again from this seller.  Honest and quick- Much appreciated! Thanks 	1
I would buy from seller again.  Great description	1
I would charge the phone till it gets too 100% and it wold die literally in 5 minutes  	0
I would definitely purchase my next cell phone from them.  They were great and I have a wonderful phone!	1
"I would give this junk a zero if I could.  DO NOT INSTALL SOFTWARE UPDATES from apple, this has a high probability of destroying older generations of iphones.  apple destroyed the software from my first 3gs during an update and replaced the phone with a &quot;refurbished&quot; model and a 90 day warranty which was not detailed.  The 4GS update destroyed the software of the replacement iphone and apple will not replace their product.  apple admitted the update flaws were their fault, but would not do anything about it.  I would not recommend this product to an enemy, let alone a friend.  Save money, headaches and trouble:  buy an android!"	0
"I WOULD HAVE LIKED IT,IF I COULD HAVE ACTIVATED IT.EVERYTIME I TRIED THEY SAID IT WAS A PREPAID PHONE.I SOLD IT, THEN HAD TO PAY THEM BACK BECAUSE THEY COULDN&apos;T ACTIVATE IT EITHER."	0

I would have loved this phone but I can't hear anything when making phone calls I've managed to atleast get the noise for the keyboard working and I could also hear the music and all other apps but I'm really disappointed in the fact that I can't hear anything on a phone call unless you put the phone on speaker which is pretty inconvenient i wish I had gotten the g3 instead...	0
i would like know what happen to my phone.it over two month since i brought this phone and i have not recieve it as yet.	0
I would like recommend people to do business with this seller because I am very satisfied with the product and business communications.	1
"I would like to comment my experience with the seller. It hasnt been the best one since the phone is not working at all! It took me a while to open it since Im a musician and travel all the time! Second: the accessories are not original and they sold it to me like they were new!!! Totally fake! I tried to contact the seller and they told me since it has been a couple months they could t do anything, even tho I explained to him the motive. They told me I should call Samsung, which is not right at all since the phone didnt work a single time. Totally disappointed. I lost my money and I would not advice you to buy anything with them! No respect at all since they should change the product and at least send me the original accessories!"	0
"I WOULD LIKE TO RETURN MY ITEM,I&apos;M VERY UNHAPPY WITH THE FACT THAT U SOLD ME A PHONE THAT IS DISCONTINUED.I PURCHASED A SIM CARD AND I TRYED TO ADD MINUTES AND THATS WHEN I WAS TOLD THAT THIS PHONE IS DISCONTINUED,I WAS VERY DIS APPOINTED AND I FEEL THAT YOU SOLD THIS PHONE NOIMG THIS AND I WOULD LIKE TO SEND IT BACK .SO CAN YOU PLEASE GIVE ME YOU INFO TO SEND IT BACK AND YOU CAN RETURN MY PAYMENT.THANK YOU"	0
I would like to return this item and exchange it for a new one. It has not worked correctly since I received it. I thought it was something I was doing wrong but after bringing it to a cell phone store and they could not figure it out I've decided it's not me. Please email what I need to do to replace this item.	0
I would like to say that this person was very helpful and sent my phone out fast would love to do bussiness with them again when im in the need for something	1
"I would like to write a review.  I would like to receive the product so I can write a review.  I decided to buy it because I need a phone to replace one that got chewed up, but I haven&apos;t received this phone yet, so I still don&apos;t have a phone."	0
"I would love to rate this product, however there was an issue with shipping. Unfortunately I never received my purchases as i paid for 3 of them. Purchase price was well over 400 dollars. This was a mistake in my opinion and observations solely on ebay's part. The seller did there part as well as the buyer"	0
"I would love to write a positive review of this item, but I bought the phone on November 12,2008 and today is December 2, 2008 and I still have not recieved the phone.  My rating is on service only at this point."	0
I would never do business with this seller ever. He believes in unilateral contacts. Beware 	0
"I would never recommend this seller. BAD  Slow Shipper. I did Finally receive the phone and charger, after 2 email requests asking if the phone was shipped. The seller never marked the phone as shipped on eBay. Both the Phone and charger were thrown in a Unpadded bag. The Charger wasn&apos;t even wound up and the phone had no Protective padding. Not to my surprise, the phone was not as described. The listing said that it did not have a mark on it. There were marks on the screen and scratches at the bottom of the phone.   In my opinion,this person should not be selling on eBay."	0
"I would not buy this phone.  I ended up returning it.  Unless you don&apos;t mind being SUPER patient with a constantly freezing phone, I suggest you don&apos;t buy this."	0
I would not know anything about it i paid 120 for aphone i never recived 	0
I would not recommend anyone to buy from this seller. Sold me a smartphone with no battery or back...and would not make good on it...Bought several costly batteries &amp; still does not work!	0
I would not recommend purchasing a product like this because an unlocked phone is worthless if it&apos;s reported atolen. You can&apos;t do anything with it. You have no protection for your hard earned money	0
I would not recommend this store to anyone. The galaxy s4 wasn't brand new it wouldn't hold an charge. It also wouldn't pick up tmobile towers. I'm requesting my money back.	0
I would really recommend this seller	1
I would recommend this to every 1 best Blackberry ever!! FEELS LIKE  A IPHONE AND A BB ALL IN 1 IF YOU GONNA GET A BB GET THE BLACKBERRY 9800 TORCH	1
"I would say worth for the money for a minimal smartphone user, but the money I paid is not a little and I would suggest, there are many more out there for the price with lot more features.     Do not buy it unless is a killer deal !!"	0
I would tell you how this phone was if i received the right phone from bluedot. Then they can&apos;t even send the 3g slide out like i wanted it.	0
I woulde have a better review but this is the first time I owned this type of phone. Had a bad experience with the seller and the face was completly cracked so the phone doesnt work very we&apos;ll for me. Makes it hard to write a text send or even read them. I am sure the phone would be great if the phone wasnt in such bad condition.	0
"I wouldn&apos;t mind getting the phone, BUT NO expandable memory(very APPLE), and I cant just transfer a file from the computer, and read it directly from the phone,"	0
"I wouldn&apos;t pay $5 for this phone now that I know.  I have never had so many complaints about call quality from the person on the other end of the line.  The internet doesn&apos;t work right, I could never even get it to download my email.  By the way, you can only have it check 1 email account.  You can set up more than one, but only one can be &quot;active&quot;. The GMail app is useless!  The keyboard doesn&apos;t come up when you tap the login field, so there is no way to log in for GMail.  The other Google apps they put on the phone go to the Chinese version, some have the option to use go to English site, some do not.  The accelerometer doesn&apos;t even work, it only uses landscape mode for pictures and videos.    I bought this phone for the sole purpose to be a temporary phone (a couple months max until the hot new Android phone comes out) to test/try out using Android and decide if I can get used to a design without a physical keyboard... this is NEITHER.  THIS IS NOT ANDROID.  IT IS A FAKE OS TO LOOK LIKE ANDROID.  You can&apos;t even add icons to the home pages.  And as mentioned earlier, the keyboard does not even rotate to landscape, and is tiny, not finger friendly.  This is a stylus phone (built-in on the side), not really conducive to touch except for navigating through menus and settings... which I did A LOT trying to make the thing work.      Bottom line.. DON&apos;T WASTE YOUR MONEY.  My &quot;temporary&quot; phone lasted me a week, now I&apos;m back to my crappy Windows Mobile phone (ATT 8525) until I decide on which REAL Android device to get."	0
I wouldnt advise to buy anything from this guy. Hes a cheap and a liar.  	0
"I wouldnt know I never received it. I purchased the phone on december 23. I got several emails saying that they were out of stock, that they would refund me or send me one when it came in. Then on Jan 3 I received an email stating the item had been shipped. It never came. I gave it several weeks, then looked it up by the tracking number. It was returned to shipper."	0
"I wouldn't recommend these phones to anyone. It is not the sellers fault by oh means.. The phones lag bad, shuts off and restarts on its own.."	0
"I wrote an email to the seller asking if I can buy the two iPhone's from him, he sent me a message and told me to send him my paypal email so he can send me an invoice. But I didn't want to deal outside of ebay, so I decided to keep bidding on the items but to my surprise this seller blocked my bids."	0
I&apos;ll say this is a ok phone it just needs more space to be a droid but overall good battery not good on it at all	0
I&apos;m a klutz! Needed a new phone that wouldn&apos;t break in my pocket.  Thanks for getting me a great phone at a great price!	1
"I&apos;m a total sony ericsson fan boy i&apos;ll admit. This phone is pretty much everything you could want, but if you want really good music get a pair of the headphones they ship with the walkman line phones as they are higher quality than the ones that come with this phone."	1
I&apos;m disappointed with this item and spent a lot of money fixing it. The person working on it said the phone probably was dropped because it&apos;s not working either to call or to send text no battery charger either.	0
I&apos;m giving this phone to my boyfriend and I decided to take it for a spin :P It quite the phone! I am 100% sure my boyfriend will enjoy this phone!	1
I&apos;m hanging onto my great AT&amp;T Plan. This phone is the last &amp; best of the Chipless candybars.The seller provided me with a good used phone.	1
I&apos;m happy the phone is in working order and was able to connect to the Sprint network...I was worried. Thanks for not disappointing me!!	1
I&apos;m happy whit my cell... thanks  I&apos;m happy whit my cell... thanks  excellent service!!    I recomend this... so good	1
"I&apos;m just praying that the seller receive the phone back, &amp; that knowone had stolen it or mishandled it, I&apos;m trying to get a refund for the 2nd DOA phone I received,but they said they won&apos;t refund me until they get their phone back, (which is understandable), I sent the phone back via USPS on 12/14/11, &amp; they still haven&apos;t received it. Guess we&apos;ll have to see if they get it? But can&apos;t let this unfortunate situation get the best of me."	0
"I&apos;m not able to use this phone, it drops every call I make, I have to keep redialing my party to try to finish my conversation. I purchased it because I thought it was just like the one I had that was broken. I&apos;m very disappointed in this phone."	0
"I&apos;m not sure which one this is. The first one i tried to but said it wasn&apos;t available. I found another one and got it.   I like the motorola because of the ease of use and style.   My first one got damaged unfortunately and the mororola wasn&apos;t available at the stores anymore. The Track phones that replaced it was  a Samsung and i just don&apos;t think it is as good as the Motorola, so I ordered another from ebay.   thanks for asking,  chris"	1
I&apos;m prepaid phone user and It is such a great phone to use. I like the simple phone like this one. There is no disklike about the product. It&apos;s also cheap.	1
"I&apos;m SO glad I made sure to check that this phone was still under warranty before purchasing.  The seller advertised this as a NEW Apple 5c yet within 2 weeks of receiving it, the battery stopped charging.  When I received it, the item had clearly been opened and repackaged.  Which would have been fine if it wasn&apos;t so poorly repackaged.  Thankfully, I went to my nearest Apple store and they replaced it right away.  Based on the quality I received the phone in, it should have been described as used.  There were also issues with the touch screen from day one. Overall, the phone is cheaper than I would have paid in store, but still not worth the price."	0
I&apos;m so sorry for this option because the seller was fake accounts.  Eventually no experience ever in my hands the phone  To be able to say my experience	0
I&apos;m sorry I couldn&apos;t rating anything I tried to contact customer service for help i  never received any phones i need a refund for both phones thanks I knew Ebay is great but i need my money back as soon as possible	1
"I&apos;m still waiting to receive my NEW phone.  That i purchased on June 15th, and its now the 25th.  I really need this phone!   I really hope this wasn&apos;t a scam!"	0
"I&apos;m using this excellent phone on a daily basis with ATT and no problems sending and receiving calls, good experience."	1
I&apos;m very disappointed with this purchase. As of today I did not get item saying that I did not give correct address. But it was not my fault. Local post office changed their policy and given address became void.I did wrote to seller requesting for reposting but no response. I&apos;m willing to bear additional postage cost.	0
i&apos;m very happey to buy from him ifound it very good  and i&apos;m recommended him to evry one   it is very good product	1
i&apos;m very happy with the product; it came very fast.  i needed an at&amp;t  replacement and this product was the least expensive.	1
"I&apos;m very unhappy about this , charged first 2 times , then giving unable to charge  , contacted MOTOROLA , they said that mobile was intended for China&apos;s market and it won&apos;t have full functionality in another country .They said that the phone was intended for use in China therefore the charging properties are not compatible with another country, which doesn&apos;t make sense , since charger is a standard model : 5011a , Input range 100-240 V AC 50/60HZ 0.1A ,  output is 5v DC 550mA. They said I wasn&apos;t covered with International warranty , since I bought from an ebay seller - even though item is brand new and genuine ( they confirmed IMEI ), they said International warranty wasn&apos;t transferable , which never happens , warranty moves with mobile not with buyer.So I have to pay to get it fixed by Motorola when its a brand new item.    Ebay seller was helpful and offered a refund only after returning item , BUT for me still not worth it , since postage registered signed-for to China is very high.    So I ended with a faulty mobile , and a miserable nonexistent service from Motorola.    Won&apos;t buy any other Motorola 100% guaranteed!!!!!"	0
"I&apos;ts amazing mobile,i love it, there is a problem with the NFS Shift application - it&apos;s not working,but it&apos;s a very good product.  Like the rest of the smartphones,this one has a day battery life..."	1
"I&apos;ve always had inferior phones in the past and just never knew it.  When I lost my old Sprint phone, I thought I was in &quot;bad shape&quot; and &quot;cruisin&apos; for a bruisin&apos;&quot; !!!  However, when I got my new Samsung SPH M500 from Ebay seller Go Green Cellular, it&apos;s the most fantastic phone I&apos;ve ever owned and has great features !!!  Thanks !!!"	1
"I&apos;ve been changing cell phones every 3 months or so for the last couple of years, either they&apos;re too simple, too weak, too complicated, poor signal, flex failure, etc.  I read about the Samsung Xplorer and decided to give it a try.  Best phone I&apos;ve ever had.  Basic features, water and dust resistant, loud, and robust.  All I was asking for.    Pros...  Loud ringing and speaker.  All its specs are true, not like some others who claim they are water resistant and they&apos;re not.  Better signal reception than most regular phones.  Robust like hell.  easy to use.    Cons...  The material it is made of doesn&apos;t slip off fabric quite easily, so if you use your phone in your pants pocket, it&apos;s a little difficult to get it out.   I hate it when I&apos;m driving and it rings.    But other than that I think I&apos;ll stay with this one for a long time."	1
I&apos;ve been using my EVO for a couple weeks now and I am very happy with the ease of use and function of this phone.  I would highly recomend an EVO to anyone considering an android smart phone.  You will be opened up to a whole new world of apps as well as brousing and messaging.  So if you are looking for the hottest phone out there look no farther than the EVO.	1
"I&apos;ve been using Verizon pay as you go for years.  The minutes roll over, I buy my own phone and this was a seamless transition to a new phone with all new features!  These phones are workhorses - but sleek and full of the best technical features."	1
I&apos;ve contacted the seller.  Went to T-Mobile and they&apos;ve told me that the phone the seller sold to me doesn&apos;t work because the seller still has a balance on the phone.   Still have not heard back from the seller	0
"I&apos;ve had every phone and operating system over the years and I must say, this wasn&apos;t what I was expecting from windows. My most recent change from Android 4 and IOS 6 has been a pleasant surprise. I haven&apos;t found too many things this phone WON&apos;T open (common occurrence with IOS) and syncing with the phone is flawless. My business mail is more reliable than IOS (which I thought was perfect) and calls are always strong and clear.  The system never slows down, never hangs or stutters, and I only reboot because I think its a good idea....not because I have to. Battery is better than average for what I&apos;m used to but could be better. It&apos;s definitely better than Android and probably on par or a little better than IOS. This phone hasn&apos;t left me lacking in any way since I&apos;ve had it. I&apos;ve always been a fan of Nokia since back in the day and I think I will continue that now with this phone lineup.  If you want or need something different than Android and IOS and haven&apos;t liked Windows phones in the past, I highly recommend the Windows phones now because they are NOTHING like the old windows. Our company is slowing phasing out IOS to this platform due to less problems and better compatibility.  They are just rock solid phones."	1
"I&apos;ve had many cell phones and many cellular companies.  The Razr is by far my favorite cell phone.      One major thing everyone warned me about before I got it was that it is frail and easily broken.  I&apos;ve had it for a little while now and have dropped it numerous times.  I&apos;m rough on cell phones (ran one over with my car...oops) so I very hesitantly got a Razr.  Like I said, dropped it too many times to count...sometimes on hard tile surfaces, other times on cement and on rare occasions carpeted areas.  I&apos;ve experienced no problems as of yet.    The Razr has several features that convinced me to get it even knowing the chances of breaking it.  One is the fact that it is a picture phone and you can take short videos as well.  The quality of both is good.  You can have individual ring tones for people in you address book and can have a picture displayed when they call.  The Razr is bluetooth ready.    It&apos;s slim and sleek.  For those of you that are into tight clothes, you can slip it into that pocket on those tight jeans and still be able to breathe."	1
"I&apos;ve had my Palm 650 for 7 years - a &quot;smartphone&quot; before smartphones were common.  I love this phone/PDA and have used it actively for all these years.  I especially like the Palm Desktop software, which is now outdated and only supported as legacy software.  I kept my Palm Treo in a leather case and used a desktop &quot;hot sync&quot; to sync it with the desktop software:  this has kept my calendar and all my contacts up-to-date.  It&apos;s true that now other smartphones offer more, but this phone has seen me through plenty of travails.  I&apos;m unwilling to change to a different smartphone until I&apos;m sure that I&apos;ll find one that I&apos;m confortable with and has the ease of syncing as my Treo has.  With Palm being purchased by HP I was hoping for a new, updated wave of Palms, but it looks as though this isn&apos;t going to happen.  Too bad!  In any case, my Palm Treo 650 has and continues to serve me well  :)"	1
"I&apos;ve had my treo750 for about a month now, and all I can say is what a great pc computer/phone. Besides using it for all of my calls, I&apos;ve also resumed writing some short stories using on it. That was actually the main reason for buying it. Unlike with my laptop, the Treo instantly gets me up and writing while it&apos;s all still fresh in my head. It&apos;s definitely a five-star in my house; especially with my teenage daughter, who has confiscated my...I mean now, her laptop."	1
"i&apos;ve had nothing but problems with the phone that i&apos;ve ordered.when they sent it to me it wsa missing the battery cover,when i called to retrieve it they said that it doesn&apos;t come with one and i would have to buy my own.when i tried to use it it didn&apos;t work so i sent it back.when they sent me it for the second time they sent the same one back hoping it would work,it didn&apos;t so i had to send it back again.the sent me a brand new phone  again and come to find out just yesterday that this one doesn&apos;t work neither.i&apos;m going to ask for a full refund now beings i&apos;m tired of sending it back,and they still haven&apos;t paid for my shipping and handeling."	0
"I&apos;ve had the blackberry 8530 Curve for a week now and I love it, haven&apos;t had any problems with it, it was fast shipping, works great, everything that was noted was included."	1
I&apos;ve had this phone for about 9 months.     The Pros...Easy to use manual keyboard and the auto landscape feature works as it should. The sreen is great and very durable. I&apos;ve dropped mine a number of times and it has never left a scratch or crack in the screen. The keybord works well but sometimes the virtual keyboard can be preety inaccurate. It supports saving apps to memory card although some apps can&apos;t be saved and basically take up space in the phone&apos;s limited internal memory. The sound is good and it takes great pictures. Reception os hit or miss but no worse than other Sprint phones I&apos;ve had in this area.    The Cons...There are many. The phone is horribly slow. The battery life is horrendous. When switching from apps it refuses to completely close the old app and the new app is sluggish until the old app finally ends. Making a call is a lesson in madness. Scrolling through the contact list is almost impossible because the slightest touch on a name brings up their profile to call. When you finally find your person you can tap on the name 2 or 3 times before it responds. After hanging up the phone feezes for at least 30 seconds before you can attempt another call or go to a different screen. Sometimes it will just sit there until you get a notice that it needs to force close. Force closures happen all the time and some of the internal (non-removable) apps start at random. My auto GPS program starts at all random times and sucks the battery down quickly. It is one of the many programs pre installed that can&apos;t be removed. The mail system is quirky. Sometimes you get mail and sometimes you will see it only to have it disapper a short time later. It constantly rejects text messages due to memory being full but even after deleting all messages it still gives same error and refuses new texts. I have to constantly pull the battery to reset and on many occasions after reinstalling the battery it will start to boot but then do nothing but stay in the boot phaze until I pull the battery again. It takes forever to boot. Very frustrating phone. A real lemon that Sprint techs have even agreed with.	0
"I&apos;ve had this phone for about four years and LOVE it!  The large font and loud speaker and earphone are SO helpful for us old folks.  And the buttons are very easy to read and light up too.  The phone is small, light, and thin - perfect for wearing on a neck lanyard.  The back cover does come off too easily (I lost mine), but for $5 to $8 on Ebay you can get terrific snap-on covers that work beautifully.    I&apos;ve never found any other phone to touch the Vero except for three phones that are essentially clones of this phone and differ mostly cosmetically.  These are the Sanyo Mirro (also out of production and on Sprint) and the NEW Kyocera Coast (on Boost) and the Kyocera Kona (on Virgin).  BTW, Kyocera owns Sanyo.     The latter two are all but identical and do have an improved camera of 2mp instead of the 1.3mp on the Vero and Mirro.  They also have lanyard holes on the BOTTOM of the phone where they belong (Vero&apos;s are on top).  Neck lanyards, btw, are THE best way to prevent lost or dropped phones ... mine is ALWAYS around my neck when I go out and has NEVER been dropped or lost or stolen.  Best news of all: the Vero and Mirro may now be used on TING, a new provider using the Sprint network along with FREE roaming on the whole Verizon network, with pricing MUCH lower than Sprint&apos;s and NO contract.  Check out Ting.com for a really nice surprise.      The Kona and Coast are not yet on the Ting system, but here&apos;s hoping.  Why?  Because they sell NEW on Amazon for $15 to $18 right now, the bargain of the century!  This is great stuff, folks!"	1
"I&apos;ve had this phone longer than any other cell phone and I have no plans to get rid of it. I am way too connected during work and for my personal use I prefer to keep my communication simple, and while I admire the iPhone, Driod, etc. I do not wish to be that connected to the world when I am not working. A simple but dependable phone is what I want and the 920 does it. Another reason I like the 920 is because it&apos;s not so thin that I can&apos;t open it. I have very large hands and those razor type phones are a pain to use. One final reason I still have my 920 and bought a spare is because it is a flip phone. When it&apos;s closed it can&apos;t make random calls.     I guess the drawback with mine is I can&apos;t switch carriers. There&apos;s no SIM card and my address book must be backed up the old fashioned way. I know this phone is a relic but if all you want is a solid and excellent cell phone this will do it.     There&apos;s another drawback.... it&apos;s discontinued. Have to get one used if you want one. I&apos;ll bet nobody is reading this review of such an old old phone, or if they are they never made it this far down. If they did they are wondering how much more can a person possibly rant about a 4 year old phone. Well, this is long enough. I&apos;m done."	1
"I&apos;ve never been quite disrespected like that in my life and the funny thing about it was I didn&apos;t know I was doing anything wrong but apparently people don&apos;t start out with less than 3 feedback according to this seller (which I didn&apos;t know how she started out cuz I had to at zero but she IS a zero because she&apos;s harrassing me telling me not to send the payment that I decided to mail anyway via money order cuz I can prove it&apos;s on the way to her so I will force her to complete the sale and review and put a feedback and spread this around so that no one has to feel bullied ever by such a trashbag.  I cannot believe the audacity that I won an item and I am BEING TOLD AFTERWARD that I didn&apos;t (when I so blatantly on paper did. She can&apos;t get this closed within the amount of time she&apos;s going to want this paid in now.  I will not be made to feel inadequate and I hope my taking a stand against bully sellers like this inspires all of Ebay to seriously not get involved with this woman.  She can&apos;t even stand by the certainty about the esn...Did you notice the dancing around the subject?  OH HOW FUNNY TOO --- She&apos;s got a negative feedback (sure it&apos;s been a while since she got it) but what does it say about someone&apos;s character when they are written negatively about JUST WHEN THEIR REPUTATION MEANS MOST TO THEM ON EBAY AS A SELLER...within their first few sales????]    She&apos;s a mongrel, a seller without a brain to realize I would totally fight her on this and I don&apos;t know how easy I can make this on her but I know how hard I can because I deserve to win because next to the space where the id of the winning bidder is written in every auction listing following it&apos;s closing is my ebay id.  And that&apos;s just plain beautiful.  I hope no one has to go through what I&apos;ve been through tonight.    Except this seller.  Anyone want the real deal contact me and I&apos;ll show you the messages she sent me via email directly not through ebay so that people wouldn&apos;t be able to see on ebay she was downright out to hurt my chances of winning when my ability to pay was never in question and I will be happy to show all the hurtful things she said...TO ANYONE ****       To all, Happy New Year and my advice is to resolve not to purchase items with this ebayer because why does she deserve the opportunity to possibly disappoint as well as attack you and possibly (but in this case SO NOT) get away with it if you were a weak person and decided not to fight them on it...I&apos;m so glad I have guillones.    Thanks for reading my review.  Part Two will come tomorrow when she reads that I went right out to a 24 hour walmart and sent it to her home address....ha ha ha !!! *** LOL *** Larceny if she cashes it and doesn&apos;t send my item...and what if I don&apos;t receive it back in the mail when she &quot;mails it back&quot; but then you can&apos;t prove if it&apos;s ever GOING TO BE CASHED when it&apos;s lost and stopping payment when it&apos;s supposedly on the way back --- If she does retailiate that way and I have to go deal personally with this matter with the police I so would.    YOU TOO DO NOT HAVE TO BE A PUSHOVER...      Good night now...ready for good sleep but will be up early for the grandeur of the responses of what my &quot;responses&quot; to her inability to not contain her inner bigot and prejudiced me because of what good enough reason?  She felt like it.    Martin Luther King I think fought a war for civil rights due to being unfairly judged and also harassed.  I wish this on no one.  And I will inform you when she&apos;s up to something. Thx."	0
"I&apos;ve only had the Samsung Moment for a brief time. So far, I like the cell phone. I especially like the keyboard and how it feels. The price I paid was great. At this very moment I currently do not have any dislike at this time. The seller shipped the cell phone in a reasonable time frame. My experience has been great. Peace Be Unto You"	1
I&apos;ve owned the Huawei M735 for almost a year now. I seen one seller post it as a smartphone. That is not the truth. This is simply just a  basic touch screen phone. I am now looking for another phone because this ones screen turns black then shuts off completely. Very disappointed in this phone. Would never buys this brand again.BEWARE!!!!	0
"I&apos;ve owned this phone for 9 years now and it WILL NOT die... It&apos;s been dropped countless times, even got lost in my snow-packed driveway and encased in ice for a week.  It had been driven over, shoveled over, frozen solid. When I found it I simply put it on the charger and it lit right up and worked fine.  I travel all over the continent (pilot) and always amazed how this phone will work in the wilds of Alaska, Rocky Mountains, or the deep south where my friends&apos; fancy GSM phones have no coverage.  Too bad AMPS and TDMA are going away."	1
"I&apos;ve used the phone for about 2 weeks now and haven&apos;t had any problems with it. I like that I get all my email where ever I am. I also like the facebook app. Overall, I am very pleased with the phone."	1
"im really dissapointed because the ingo taht appears im the web site its fake, the cellphone doesnt comes unlocked, and isnt for gsm, its cdma, an locked. I try to do a return but when i send the item the courier lost it. so i lost the money ..."	0
"Ive been using Nokias for 8 years now.  For me they have been the best, sharpest tools Ive enjoyed. I have had maybe 8 of those......  As a matter of fact when buying a new phone, I always thought of Nokia,  until I had the 6670.  To make the story short. THIS DO NOT FEELS OR BEHAVES AS THE NOKIA WE ALL LOVE.  Complicated, not intuitive, slow, and with a new OS called Symbian or something, that for me,  well,   not nice. NOT TO MENTION THAT YOU CAN NOT RESTORE YOUR DATA IN BACKUP FROM YOUR 6230 TO THIS JUNK PHONE.  I am looking forward to get rid of this one and look for a real NOKIA.  I miss my 6230 so much!!!!!"	0
Iam really disappointed i bought 2 j3 samsung on october 23 and 25 up till now i have not yet received the two phones. Can you please refund back my money.  Esther	0

Ich brauchte ein neues Handy ohne groen Schnickschnack. Das Nokia 1110i ist da genau richtig. Der Akku hlt ausgesprochen lange und die Bedienung ist narrensicher.    Es wurde schnell und zuverlssig geliefert und ich bin sehr zufrieden.	1
"ich habe das Handy fr meine Frau gekauft.Sie ist total begeistert.Ich habe das gleiche Handy.Die kamera ist klasse.Der Speicher ist mit einer Speicherkarte erweiterbar.Also platz genug fr Bilder,Lieder usw.Die Videofunktion echt super lange aufnahmen.MP3 Player ist auch drinn.Alles was man so braucht.Ich wrde nie mehr tauschen.Nur etwas zu teuer.Nur zum empfehlen."	1

"Ich habe das Handy Nokia N 90 vor acht Wochen gekauft und war davon negativ beeindruckt, dass dies Handy bis heute nicht bei mir angekommen ist. Trotz sofortiger berweisung von 180,-  und mehrmaligen Aufforderungen an die Verkuferin ranma2007, mir endlich den Artikel zu senden und einer Beschwerde bei eBay blieb mir heute nichts anderes brig, als bei der Polizei Strafanzeige und Strafantrag wegen Betruges zu stellen. Weiter so, dann haben in Zukunft die Floh- und Schnppchenmrkte wieder mehr zu tun."	0
"Ich habe das Handy Nokia N90 von 18mocro88 am 05.01.07 gekauft und   am 06.01.07 den gesamt Betrag berwiesen.    Leider kann ich keine angaben zu dem Handy machen,  da ich es bis heute 10.02.07 noch nicht bekommen habe und  der Verkufer sich nicht bei mir meldet.    Mfg. grisu_2020"	0

"I'd always been sketchy about buying phones online, even after reading reviews and whatnot; but I was thankfully and wonderfully proven wrong. This phone functions and operates just like brand new and I haven't a single complaint in the world. Usually I reply to my purchases sooner, but it took a couple days as I was busy being taken by the well known magic and wonder of getting, setting up, and exploring a new phone. This was probably singlehandedly the best online purchase I've ever made. Thank you, MistyElectronics!"	1
I'd like it better if it had day long power.	1
"I'd love to keep this phone, but must return it. The volume up switch doesn't work, and there something wonky with the volume.  It did arrive on time, was in ""miint"" condition in appearance, and 98% of the features work just fine. I can't spend this much money and have a repair bill on top of it. "	0
"I'd thought about getting a new phone, but with a refurbished one being only a couple of months older but several hundred dollars less, it seemed a no-brainer.  Essentially, I was able to more than quadruple my storage space for the same price.  I opted for the 7 instead of the 6s largely for the water resistance (even if the lack of a headphone jack is a bit annoying).  The phone is plenty fast, is very responsive, and generally does what I need it to do.  I considered some Android phones, but my workplace is all Apple (employees all get MacBook Airs and iPad airs), so it makes sense to be in the same ecosystem.  I was worried about the IMEI being bad on a refurb unit, but I haven't had any trouble.  "	1

"If all you want to do is have a short conversation and take pictures this phone is for you. But if you do not like playing with toys stay away from this phone. it is true you get what you pay for. This phone has limited options, NO mute, no missed calls view and dailing the numbers is difficult if you have adult hands. Worst purchase ever for me."	0
"If felt like I didn't spend my money wisely this time  buying this type of phone. The battery drain so quick, and does not fully charge as well to 100%, unless I turn off the phone, re-insert the battery and then charge again."	0
"If I could rate a zero I would have. They sent me a phone that turns off by itself randomly and calls people on its own and won't let me hang up, I have to constantly take the battery out and restart the phone. So their solution was to send me a new battery which the sticker was all the way red on it when I received it indicating that it had water damage. They will not send me a new battery which the sticker was all the way red on it when I received it indicating that it had water damage. They will not send me a new phone until they receive this defective one. So I'm supposed to go a week without a phone cuz they sent me a defective phone. How on earth is that fair???"	0

If it was truly jail broken this device would have already been given an extension to its functionality through a Cydia software injection. The seller only contacted me once with no pictures of the installation of the software of the phone. If the product has no SIM card the seller should have advertised it in the ad of jail broken iPhone listings. You cant function the phone to see if its really 128 GB of storage without installing a SIM card. This is the worst buy on eBay yet. I think this seller could have stolen it to sell on eBay. These are pictures of what to expect after turning it on.   	0

"if the phone was a good working phone for the seller, it should have been problem free when I got it.  I had Samsung set the phone up over the phone but they told me that they need to see it to trouble shoot it.  very poor transaction seller did offer me a full refund but I need to have a phone. this one I could dial out and receive calls. Texing is terrible. wrong letters pop up when not even hit. now I need to buy a working phone while the seller enjoys my 83.00 even if he offered me a refund.  "	0
"If the seller doesn't like how low the price is, they will message you are tell you that a product was ""misplaced"" Example that happened to me: product description says includes everything in the picture and then goes into detail about it. Like: comes with the ""wireless charging pad"" however the seller messages you and says they ""misplaced"" the charging pad if they do not like how low the price is. Then goes on to repost the same pictures with the same item description and charges more for it. Stay away from buying anything from ""myindustries"" There are also reviews that the product doesn't come with the pen and that the screens are cracked. Word of advice: Do not base your decision off the best reviews. Stay away from this listing and seller."	0

"If you are looking for a great internet phone--this isn&apos;t for you. Buy a Droid. Buy an iPhone. Once past that, though, this still works great and does some things, like keeping your calendar sync&apos;d on your desktop, better. It is a good ebook reader and a good mp3 player. It is a great PDA. There are still lots of available apps. Maybe it doesn&apos;t look as cool and it is certainly true that it is a lousy phone if you are into web browsing or streaming video or the like. Cloud computing is not its forte. But for many people this works just great, it has an SD card slot that can handle up to 32gb (although Palm specs don&apos;t say so), you can keep things on the card instead of relying on the cloud, which may not always be available, and it is affordable. You can spend more and do worse."	1
"If you are looking for a simple phone to use and you aren&apos;t huge on having *SUPER MEGA TOUCHSCRREN* features and what not, it&apos;s a great phone."	1
"If you are reading this and your getting ready to buy this phone but aren&apos;t sure because of all the bad reviews people give it. don&apos;t listen to them most of it is ridiculous about bluetooth and what not the phone is awesome it has great features and the thing with the battery life, just make sure that you don&apos;t play with the phone right away let it charge completely and hey just in case buy a car charger. I&apos;m the type of kid that is constantly playing with their cell pone and texing 24/7. but yet i still have full battery life at the end of the day.    MY PROS:  big screen  INSANELY clear camera  + it swivels  mp3 player  tex/video/instant/picture messaging  loud speakers  video caller ID.  and speaker phone      MY ONLY CONS:  if you close the phone while your sending a TeX message it automatically puts it under drafts don&apos;t get me wrong it still sends (minor thing though)      Hope this helps you"	1

"If you like the Windows OS then you will not be disappointed by this phone. The 5 inch screen is not so large as to make this phone too large for hand or pocket and has wide viewing angles. The stylish design retains the dedicated camera button that seems to be unique to Lumia phones. The camera takes great shots even in low light conditions without using the included flash. The battery easily lasts through a busy day of calls, texts and browsing with charge to spare. The battery is also removable. Its slim design is nicely balanced so it feels light in the hand. Call quality is excellent. "	1

If you want top specs wonderful picture quality at half of the price for Flagship phones absolutely this is your phone for you. If you're in fanatic this will handle just about any game that you can throw at it 32 gigs is pretty good but it's also expandable and it uses most American antennas so you're covered just about anywhere. The displays fantastic of course not as good as the latest Galaxy but definitely miles above the iPhone display.	1

"If you're a Windows geek and don't have the spare cash lying around in order to purchase a 950 (XL) then look no further :) I have been on a Windows phone since way back in 2009 when the Kin One and Two came onto the market with the first beta tile home screens running Win7(+)... The Nokia 929/930/Icon is a flagship phone that has earned that title and will not cease to impress. I have mixed and matched parts from all three models and make the best of all three worlds, but in oem form, most other phones in the current trending price range cannot match or surpass the tech inside. The screen's saturation is an industry leader (for the year it came out) and the processor is just shy of the 950 (XL)! In your hand you now can feel empowered and you can tell all your iphone-sheep-friends to eat your heart out... Windows FTW :)   Cheers.  ~Wolf"	1

"I'll try to keep this short and to the point.  Prior to this experience, I've never returned anything in my life. But I had my first two returns with this company! I ordered this over a month ago with the intent for it to be a birthday present on November 26th (today is December 28th). It arrived promptly but was damaged upon arrival. (Remember, this item is listed as ""NEW""). Customer service was good at promptly creating a return and shipping me out a replacement. The replacement that was shipped out was also damaged and could not be activated by verizon! I returned that device also, then they tell me there is nothing they can do because that was the last ""NEW"" phone! Then it took them OVER A WEEK to refund my money back!  In short: I lost money. I lost time. I'm in the same position I was in over a month ago before dealing with this shady company. I do not recommend them. Verizon said the phone was used when I tried to activate it. Phone problems: First phone had a loose back button that felt cheap and was driving me crazy. Second phone could not be activated by verizon because the phone would not recognize the Sim Card (Bad Reader)! They promised they would refund me for wasted screen protectors I bought and applied on their broken phones - DID NOT RECEIVE A REFUND."	0

I guess... that you can use for any provider if you have to use NEXTEL services, is limited o LOCKED for NEXTEL uses.  I think in this case, the seller have to be more especific, ok, is limited for NEXTEL, but not unlocked, Unlocked for specific plans, but I think is kind of confused when you write UNLOCKED and is locked.

I'm used to the size and layout of this iPhone se however my iPhone 5 freezes up. Required battery replacement early on and I got 1 iOS update. Since purchasing the SE which looks brand new not even a hint of use and battery health 98%! Literally stays on for days! I just got my 3rd iOS update yesterday! And thankfully since I same size of iPhone 5 I have lots of cases that fit it already. Camera is nice as the 6S and processor too so is fast. I get safelink wireless lifeline for free and they use tracfone so I plan to activate it with them and port my att number over at same time cause I have a Verizon sim. Works already with sim in it but need to have it on my acct so I can hav it unlocked within 12m or if was used that long already I can activate and then unlock same day. I'm so glad I took a chance. Also got a 5S for my dad cause it's still getting updates but unfortunately it's straight talk but should b same to unlock however having Verizon sim it can't b done they don't activate phones anymore that don't have VoLTE (voice and data over LTE. But my dad can leave att n activate with straight talk cheaper once his contract is up sept. It also appeared to be new. 100.00 total for 2 new looking phones that are amazing thank u eBay. 	1

Imagine that new Marshmallow version on moto G 2015 has really little or no bloadware. Run really good. Long battery over 15 hours mixed usage. Fast charge. Solid phone. Strongly recommend.	1
"Immaculate, came without a scratch on it. Only bummer's no OEM charger/packaging, but seller said that."	1
"In a couple of weeks, the phone stopped working properly. I would type something into google and hit search...the screen would go black and phone would then go back to the main screen. Was told that the screen needs to be replaced."	0

"in late november he sent me the phone, which did not work, so he told me to send it back so he could send a new one. i sent it back, and did not get a new one in a few weeks.  he told me i would get it on a certain day, which was a lie because i did not recieve it. he then said he would give me a full refund, but has yet to grant that. i guess i should say buyer beware."	0
In my country this product has some problems because some times work and other no.  For  example I am in central park  San Jose CoSTA RICA AND THE PHONE WORK GREAT BUT I WALK 5 MILES AND THE PHONE ISN&apos;T WORK. IS THE SAME AREA AND THE SAME CODE	0

In perfect condition ! Great value	1
"In recently time, I have bought Motorola krzrk1. I like this phone because it look beautifully and full of function. If someone ask me why I bought it on ebay? Honestly, I didn&apos;t believe in ebay but now I like to buy items from ebay. This is really a good place for all of you can get the things you want with a cheap prize. Ebay is really a prestige store."	1
"In spite of the cell doesn&apos;t work with 4G networks, the phone works great, infrared port, an awesome camera. The phone is quite fast for the functions that are preloaded.  Very glad with my new cell :)"	1
"in the advertisement the phone as new, but the truth that the phone is old and it has been repaired, and a new cover has been fixed.    after 10 days of using the speaker of the phone is not working."	0
In the description he did not include that the phone has touch disease and there's no way that I can use the phone because it doesn't function properly! I'm so pissed I wasted my hard earned money to by a defeated phone !!! 	0
"In the description it says that the phone is in fair condition but I really didn't expect for the screen to be falling off, the battery life to be less than a couple hours, and for the phone to be super slow and barely load anything. "	0
"In the original ebay ad, the seller mentions minor imperfections in the device, such as screen burns. after using for a week or so i also notice that the LEDs and proximity sensor do not work. The device just feels like it has been torn apart and reassembled terribly with the fluctuations in volume and what seems like a cheap aftermarket battery. I absolutely love the device. I just wish the seller was more honest with his ad."	0
"in the publication say it&apos;s a GSM phone and they sent me a frame with a stone inside, while the product should espeificar, q do it for me, if I wanted a real phone"	0
In the thing it said nothing about have a very bad battery it dies way to fast it on last like 45 minutes.	0
IN THE TITLE SAYS G900F BUT I CHECK THE PHONE AND SAYS G900A	0
"In these days there are many buyers who don't live in the USA, so we don't know the name of the telephone company.

"Initially I loved the phone, but it has cons with me now.    Whenever dialing inputs unneccessary numbers, also calls people I never entered, vibrates when talking, camera sometimes glitches, and battery is horrible. I was thinking this was just my phone but getting a different Citrus didn&apos;t help me at all. Same issues!"	0
"Initially, I found that the phone was not a CDMA band type when I tried to use it with Verizon.  Verizon told me that it was incompatible with their network.  So, I switched service providers to a GSM band (T-Mobile) which seemed to work for awhile.  Now, unfortunately, I find that the phone does not work on cellular after I already closed my return option.  It works only with WiFi (my jetpack) and not with cellular, as it should, showing ""no service.""  I am very dissatisfied with the performance, after I paid almost $160.00 for a phone that was supposed to be brand new and compatible with the Verizon network.  My wife has the same Apple 5c phone, and it works find with cellular on the same network I am on, so it is not the service provider.  "	0

"into description says battery charger includes but he don`t send it to me, and i send a letter for let he know the missed item of the package but he said that he send a battery and a sim card but i guees to buy a cellphone with out battery is like to buy a car with out engine and the battery is necesary for the phone so that most was include in the package and i ask for the complement or a resolution but he don`t writedown any more to me and write in the feedback what kind of people buy a phone for 10 bucks and wait to recive al the equipment but if he place it in the description must to send what ever shows there rigth???? if he don`t like the price that i paid for the item he must to place a higher start bid price isn`t? but if he place a lower price he can catch the attention of some buyer like me finding for good deals i guess this is the reason for buy in ebay i hope don`t be in a mistake.  grettings                    Vaquero380"	0

"It appears that even though they say it would work anywhere where there is GSM, it worked for a while in the country that I sent it to for a gift, and then it began to fail. It presently is NOT functioning as a phone, only as a wifi device via Whatsapp.  I am going over there to see what the problem is personally. It is a very large expenditure for this problem that I have to travel from the US to Colombia, but since it was a gift, I have that obligation.  To be continued.  .E.  "	0

It as a beautiful LCD screen and loaded full of software features.  A great mp3 player and gps too.  I found it very easy to transfer my prepaid account to this phone.  The slim design is perfect for small pockets too.	1
It broke five days after I got it.  It was not fully as described.  It had a very low volume.  Seller described a slight drop.  My wife has the same phone and has dropped it several times and nothing&apos;s happened to it.  This seller doesn&apos;t appear to be that truthful.  Thank you.	0

"it' damaged more then he sucribe in ebay, seller is very nesty, he is treating me and harassed us. he not reply us timely manner. even he did not reply us when we mailed him  very nesty seller"	0
"It did not come with a Sealed cover on it, like its new. The second day I had the phone it made lots of background noise to the point where people would say I cannot hear you. I have this phone call recorded! It continues until today. I took it to Verizon to see what the history of the phone was. They said it was on for five days. They told me they didnt see anything wrong with it. Im going back to let them hear the phone calls I have taped so they hear the background noise. This seller refused to return this phone. Her comment was take it to Verizon! Verizon did not sell me the phone so they are responsible. I think I see the nose growing longer!"	0
It did not work out of the box. Took over four minutes to power on and the audio chip was not working. :-(	0

"It do not work on my country, it connects to the gsm network but I can&apos;t make or receive calls, I try to contact the seller but he never respond, I recomend do not buy this phone"	0
"It does all that I need it to do, and it came with one year of Time. It would have cost me more to buy the package for my old phone. I liked it so much, I just bought another one for my wife."	1
"It does not fit the phone!It says it&apos;s for this phone model but I don&apos;t see how?  I believe it should just snap into place, but it&apos;s not even the same size or shape of the phone. I am not sure if they sent the wrong one or not??"	0
"It does not show either available days nor minutes, UNBELIEVABLE. I bought one about eleven weeks ago. I cannot have a private conversation because it is only possible to hear the other person if I turn on the speaker setting. Then it makes a loudish CHIRP about six times a day. No that has nothing to do with a low battery prompt. Conclusion: the newer a tracfone gets the less good it is. I could be happy with the previous generation one, although I liked the even earlier one better. I wish there were a way to return it for a refund. after using trafones 10 years i am ready to switch companies."	0
"It does not tell the truth, it does not answer the messages, it is not responsible and it is deceptive."	0
IT DOES NOT WORK 	0
"It does not work does not hold batte,He says that almost new is not true is a 3/10 "	0
"It does say that the phone is locked when I look back in detail at the description but I didn't know that meant that it could only be used with sprint or boost or a few others. Just don't get this phone if you plan to use it with ATT or T-Mobile or whatever else you are on because it is a hassle!  I wish they would have highlighted that more. I feel kind of tricked even though that might be unfair since it does specify ""locked"" in the description."	0
"It doesn&apos;t work in Australia. I didn&apos;t know that before I bought it. It was useless to me, and sent with an American plug on the recharger instead of a usb recharger, so I had to buy an expensive adaptor to charge it in order to find out it doesn&apos;t work!"	0
"It doesnt cost a $1000.  It does everything that you need a phone for and still has a sound system plug, a home button and isnt oversized.  "	1
"It doesn't have a memory card slot, with only 64g internal storage. You can't hide apps with the default launcher. "	0

"It fell out of my coat in morning,found it in the street in afternoon. It got ran over and sat in ice water. Not one bit of damage or distortion."	1
"It fits nice in a shirt-pocket and is easily retrievable as it doesn&apos;t  fall sideways into the bottom of the pocket like flip phones, and then one must struggle to retrieve them, right them, and then flip open in order to answer.  It just goes straight to work making and taking calls and an occasional voice mail.  I don&apos;t have to carry around the extra weight of an mp3, camera, bluetooth, mini-computer etc; it does not try to be any thing, but an efficient and dependable cell-phone.  Love it--love it!!!  Proof of the beautiful and the just simple-go-to-work philosophy of the Sanyo SCP 6400 is emphasised by the fact there are only 25 pages in the english section of the owners manual needed to teach you everything about using it.  It does tend to take too many calls some days tho!  I am so impressed with it that I gave a 2 month old Moto-Krazr to my daughter and bought a used one off e-bay to replace my first #6400 that had gone to cell-phone heaven.  And I paid $5 more used than for my first one, brand-new. Gladly!! No color screen or menu of extra toys to flash to friends &amp; neightbors; just a dependable work-horse that is slim, light and stays out of my way til I need it,"	1

It has a lot of features.It has a lot apps and love the navigation feature with turn by turn directions. The only thing is the battery life was not the greatest so I bought a extended battery witch helped a lot. other than that great phone.	1
"it has a qwerty keyboard. it good but, it chinese phone neither the TV or internet works. My cellphone Co. cannot set it up"	0
It has all the features I wanted. Thanks.	1
It has been paid .but not send	0
It has camera and video &amp; I got it for a great price.  The quality of the photos and footage is pretty clear with good resolution. The phone also takes a sound chip that makes it possible to play mp3&apos;s and that is a plus too.	1
"It has great sound quality, and I was looking forward to using the mods. I purchased the JBL speaker and power pack through Amazon. It's a great phone, and easy to use too."	1
it has little scratches on the side of the sreen 	0
It has many functions but is difficult to use especially the screen is too small and I always type in wrong letters.  I have gone back to a normal phone.  I returned the item.	0
It has really long battery life comparing to iPhones. The camera is also one of the best and you wont regret it.	1
"It has to be a bad product, the did not want to deliver"	0
"It has ultra short battery life, I transferred sim card out of my previous phone which worked fine through the ATT towers this phone has terrible connection drops voice calls, some times doesnt ring goes straight to voice mail   looks nice and accepts different sim cards and it can be unlocked for better privacy"	0
it have every corner dent  i am done with ebay	0
"It is a a very good smartphone for this price. Good build quality, smooth OS/apps. It has a very good camera as well, and a very good display. Call quality is quite good because of the stereo mics. Summa summarum : It is a very good phone for this price."	1
"It is a big phone. It is a nice phone, large display, and plenty of processing power. Smooth operation. I came from the HTC Aria, whick is tiny. This phone doesn&apos;t lag like the aria. The battery life isn&apos;t the best, but none of the HTC phones seem to have a great battery life. I can make it all day with the sync turned off, and very lite use. Moderate use requires the dreaded cable. They do have extended batteries for this model too. Solid high end phone with lots of features."	1
"It is a compliment seller, get my product on time  It is a compliment seller, get my product on timepurchased cell phone, he was in good conditionI recommend this seller for its timeliness and quality"	1
"It is a excellent phone came out with everything the seller said it would, performance is excellent takes greats pictures, the battery doesn't last to long but the seller send a second battery..so problem solved. "	1
It is a fake cellphone. I t returned it. It is a scam people like those should not sell on ebay it will give ebay a bad reputation. I had to return it and pay over $50 from my pocket for the shipping. the seller offered me the refund in one condition that I should pay the return shipping to get my money back. I had to do it ..I will never ever going to buy again from ebay if those people will sell fake products under ebay name...this is a scam should be flagged. ebay should not allow the selling of fake products. I am very disappointed and I already lost over $50 for the return shipping. Please do not buy from this seller and flag it. IT IS FAKE PHONE	0

It is a great phone and in the value is worth every penny thanks so much	1
It is a great phone for a very reasonable price.  Easy to understand how to use it.  Qwerty keyboard is great.  A little slippery to hold onto until I got a rubberized case.	1

It is a large phone and very outdated.  It worked fine but there have been so many advances since this phone first came out.  I would not recommend it to anyone who carries it in their pocket.  It is pretty big.	0

It is a piece of shit the mic does not work half the time in the speaker is very poor quality	0
It is a real lemon the phone did not respond to the commands the screen never work well ..... the battery was blocked it did not last more than 3 hours .... and without using it .... the port charging in poor condition. ... is the worst cell phone I've bought ..... aesthetically very nice but the worst in operation	0
It is a really great phone. The screen is a bit larger than some Androids; love that. It functions well and I'm just so happy with it.	1
"It is a shame that Blackberry 10 is gone, it really is. This phone is fluid and easy to use with many features that I cannot get on another device. The battery life is very good and the Keyboard is great! "	1
"It is a sleek looking phone with great battery life. The phones interface is supposed to be copied from the google &quot;android&quot; interface. The phone is very slow, and the on-screen keyboard is so small you can&apos;t use it without a stylus pen.   It is a difficult, and at times, confusing phone.  I chose to get it because i looked efficient, and durable. The manual that came with the phone was for the actual Google phone, and was of no help with the Xinrong phone.  It seems more like it would be used for a palm pilot than a cell phone. Overall I was disappointed in it."	0
"IT IS A SMALL PHONE WITH GREAT FEATURES THE TOUCH SCREAM HAS A GREAT RESPONSE, THE CAMERA IS GREAT, THE SOUND IS GREAT AND THE MUSIC PLAYBACK FEATURE IS EXCELLANT"	1
"It is a very good cell phone, works perfect. Justo as espected."	1
it is a very good phone the best a ever had	1
"It is a very nice phone, for the price, very nice ! The screen  did not have a single scratch ! "	1
It is a wonderful Phone. Excelente photo quality .	1
"It is absolutely perfect, the size and shape fit my had well.  I love the color yellow, although I have a cover on it that I designed which is a field of sunflowers. "	1
It is amazing that even lower end model phones can have such great features. I bought 2 of these for my kids and they really like them. It was an upgrade from their Samsung On5 that only had 8 gb internal this one has 32 gb. The finger print scanner is as good and the same one as my 700 dollar v20. Not bad at all for 90 dollars. Nice looks slim and rounded glass. 	1
It is an amazing product!	1
"IT IS AN EXCELLENT DEVICE BUT THE ONE THAT I HAVE BOUGHT IT WAS AS I WAS EXPECTED, THE ORIGINAL DISCRIPTION IT WAS FALSE. IT SUPPOSED TO BE UNLOCKED AND THE ONLY PROBLEM WAS THE CRACKED DIGITIZER BUT WHEN I GET IT I REALLIZED THAT IT WAS LOCKED AND THAT THE UNLOCKED CODE THAT THE SELLER SENT ME WASS FALSE TOO.SO I PAID EXTRA MONEY TO UNLOCKED AND THEN I NOTICED THAT IT HAS MORE ISSUES, WHEN I MAKE A CALL THE DISPLAY IS TURN TO BLACK AND YOU DONT HAVE THE CONTROL OF IT, I ALSO SEE THAT THE PHONE IT WAS ALLREADY DISASSEBLY BY SOMEONE ELSE BEFORE ME AND IT WAS ASSEBLY AGAIN IN A TERRIBLE WAY. SO AFTER ALL THIS I WOULD BUY ANYTHING ELSE FROM THIS SELLER. I M REALLY SORRY...................."	0
"It is an excellent phone, it meets required by the market at a good price.  Provides a decent camera with a good audio system.  The HTC sense makes a good user experience.    The only problem are the characteristics of the hardware environment, limiting the cell compared with the current.    In conclusion, if you&apos;re looking for a cheap phone that meets daily tasks and also possesses the ability to install more applications, besides being aesthetically beautiful, this is a good choice."	1
"It is an excellent product, I recommend it for future purchases  aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"	1
"It is an IP 68 phone, but broke in water"	0
"It is better than any smartphone because you don't have to run with a charger. If Samsung will decide to make it available for different carriers I believe they can make a lot of selling. The worst thing is the memory, but you can live with that. "	1
It is by far the smallest phone I have found on the market. It is a very convient phone. The service and the people I have ordered it from is a blessing that they carry it.	1
"It is difficult to rate a produce that is not received.  I was very skeptical to begin with because this seller had not sold anything in some time.  However, there was nothing bad on the past transactions.  This time, however, the seller decided that he didn&apos;t like ebay rules/PayPal transaction/shipping and so therefore, just not going to sell it or do business on ebay again.  That&apos;s fine and I hope he doesn&apos;t.  Now, my money is tied up for AT LEAST a week and it was a Christmas present for my son.  Very unhappy and it&apos;s a sad thing that people like this exist out there!"	0
It is easy to use and a good value for the money. My product arrived quickly and everything worked as described.	1
"It is exactly what I ordered. Delivered within 3 days of purchase. Has great camera quality, high quality sound and is easy to use. I would suggest this phone to anyone, especially at this price. "	1
"It is excellent phone, with the good chamber and a loud sound.Amazing kind and the unique mechanism of opening"	1
It is fake look at a real iPhone 7 plus box compared to that fucking fake	0
"it is faulty and has no storage space, it keeps shutting off, your product is garbage"	0
It is good and it arrived in time. 	1
It is great phone and works well.	1
"It is hard to work with. It does not come with a hand book explaining any features , you have to learn by trial and error. Texting is complex with many steps. And the phone takes cloudy  pictures."	0
It is in excellent condition	1
"it is in very bad condition not as described  item has spot that are  peeled , does not open properly and in terrible condition."	0
It is junk don't recommend it to no one 	0
It is low level programmed to fail couple month after the warranty expires. LG does it on purpose to keep high revenues. 5 friends with exactly the same problems and same phone on different carriers can't be a coincidence! Garbage!!! or maybe any LG phone brand???	0
"it is my first phone based on Android. I bought it a week ago and have not yet got used to it, but I really like it. it is a very functional, quality made phone. phone needs battery with higher capacity."	1
"It is nice phone been use it for one month, and is really good, little bit different than other Android phones, but unique, and for the price is worth it, I recommend it. "	1
It is not a LG phone is a copy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Do not buy it!	0
it is not factory unlock it is sprint phone you cant use in USA  but is OK now thank you debbie end eric	1
"It is not possible to use this phone, every time, when are downloading news from Samsung, after thatI have to bring it to service, because no sim card does not work in the phone and nothing helps, even not factory setting renovation, there needs totaly programmation, who simple usercan not make. Samsung news comes at least every 3 days, so U can use phone 3 days abd theb have to bring to service, pay for that, wait some days when, you can get it back and be ready, that after next 3days you need to bring your phone again to service. I can not use it."	0
It is not reliable since I paid and still has sent the product I want my refund	0
"It is not the product, the seller is selling phones that owe money on them, therefore they can a) NOT BE UNLOCKED if needed to switch carriers, B) the ESN, when run, is considered a problem, and C) money is owed to the original carrier.  "	0
It is not unlocked in Ukraine. Second one I bought and am very upset!	0
It is not waterproof!!	0
It is not working. It went dead as soon as I activated service. I have contacted the seller but I haven't got a response yet. 	0
It is on the lost/stolen list and not usable.  Cannot not activate it.  Bad product and wonder about the people who sold it.	0
"It is overpriced dont buy, wait till next year phones"	0
It is prepaid phone with low quality. 	0
"It is probably well that this guy is half way around the globe from me right  now.      This phone does not work and it was sold as a used phone in working condition.    Yeah, right  now I am pretty POed about the whole deal."	0
"It is rugged but really lacks a good processor and internal memory. Often locks up and kicks you out of an application, now I can see why my son got frustrated and tested just how touch it really was."	0
"It is simple wonderful phone, I just love it.  It has wonderful technologies that work perfect.  Compare to other phone this phone is more reliable, I have better result with it thatn other brands."	1
"it is so good , I can IM my friend anytime any place , I can talk to the phone and also IM anyone at same time. it is much easier to use sidekick than just regualr cell phone."	1
"It is sold under false pretenses, Verizon does not support this phone.."	0
it is the 30th iof october and no phone. we are very displeased with this i have tried to track it and it comes up saying not found	0
"It is the fact that a purchase was made through EBAY to a company called TRACFONE according to the description of the published product, to bring them to Venezuela. After the purchase they give us the product, since they already have the product with us they are informed that they can not be used anymore, since they have to be activated in the United States and after one year of activation, they can be used here In Venezuela. Seen the clear DECEPTIVE ADVERTISING and disinformation that appears in EBay (I attach the photo of the advertising) by the company tracfone since it gave us for sale the product without the information of use of the product. And they do not want to solve this problem even with the damage that continues to cause us"	0
It is totally a fraud this seller	0
It is unusable on Verizons network because it is a 3G phone and we were not informed about that. We will be returning it for hopefully a refund!	0
"it is very good ,very good battery back up .only thing screen is little small  campare to size of mobile if you compare with other mobile"	1
it is very nice. I love the text emotion cons and it is very large so not easily lost in my purse or pocket.  It works excellent and the battery life so far is great for me even though I don&apos;t use a cell phone as much as the general public.  The keyboard is very nice and large. Great for texting.  the camera however is the only thing that is not good at all. The resolution gets like a 1 or 2 as the lowest quality.  I mainly use phone for calling and texting.	1
It is very short life battery . It seems that the battery needs to be replaced by new one after few minutes the battery is empty .I wish to return it back to the seller .	0
It is very very very slow and hard to watch anything I am so disappointed can't even get data with any service	0
it is working good and this is exaclly phone i want.........thank you for good prchusing..........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................	1
"It isn&apos;t a smart phone, it doesn&apos;t connect to WIFI, forget facebook, twitter, and skype.  Text messaging ?  Yes.  internet surfing?  Yes as long as you want to go to whatever your provider has programmed in.      It&apos;s a phone and it&apos;s the most reliable phone I&apos;ve ever had.   It works great with my bluetooth headset, the display is just big enough for old eyes, the keypad can handle my thick fingers.  It does everything a phone is supposed to do.    This is my second one of these.  The first one worked for 10 years.  Yes it was a little battered looking and would have kept running if I hadn&apos;t forgotten to take it out of my jeans pocket before washing then.   Even then, most functions worked.  The only thing that didn&apos;t work was the 7 key.    Enough said.  If you&apos;re looking for a phone that works like a phone,  This is your choice."	1
it isnt even working. it wont restore or update	0
It its horrible I want money back I been trying to contact them and have gotten no answer 	0
It just works. It&apos;s a phone. Not a status symbol. I like that it is small and discrete. I can carry it and not think about it. I still have the original Cingular version along with an &quot;unlocked&quot; version that I have purchased online. If you want &quot;apps&quot; or &quot;bling&quot; find another phone.	1
"It last only a week and it locked by itself, got to remove for reset plus bunch to update every day or two, if not the phone won't work to call out / in? The WiFi horrible received only one bar or 2 even you seat next to transmitter. Firefox's SUCK."	0
It loads sooo slow. Battery dies fast. At 68% battery wake up in the morning battery at 0%. It can't multitask without loading slow then have to close programs. I just don't like this Phablet phone no more. Apps outdated. It's not worth my $70. I want my money back.	0
It look just like described. A great phone for the price. Nothing was wrong with it. I love my phone. 	1
"It looked good but when I got it and started trying to download apps, many would not download and the ones that did could not update because the Android version (2.2 I think) was so old and out dated.  Sent phone back."	0
"It looks basically new , battery lasts a very long time and charges super fast . It's a great phone for a good price."	1
It looks like it is in good shape 	1
"It may be unlocked but its ability to modify the APN settings kind of negates the whole unlock concept. Yes, the phone dials out but the data doesnt seem to work, so kind of a bummer."	0
It move really slow and keeps shutting down. 	0
It never did work after blowing another 40 on a new battery. All i can say about the pantech i was seny is peee yooo.	0
it nice and cheap  for me  i like it   very much so thank you  for letting me buying it . easy to use and no damage	1
it only has one sim card holder not 2 very dissapointed	0
It overheated and I lost all my pics and everything in the phone. Wasn't charging nor was I using it. I happened to pic it up and immediately yanked the battery out because it was so hot. Totally disgusted with it 	0
It s no unloked I was to wait 5 days 	0
"It said that is was a used product, but it din&apos;t state that some of the key don&apos;t work, therefore the phone is useless to me, because some of the keys don&apos;t work so how can you dial out?"	0
"It said,new, but might have handling marks? Mine was FACTORY SEALED every last piece was Brand New. I couldn't have been more thrilled with what I got. Product functions 100% and looks great. I am just amazed, and yet, it's why their reviews are so high. Maybe I am used to the ""hype"" being just a little larger than life and chalking that up to how people do business nowadays, but This phone is Fantastic!"	1
It says it unlockable but i bought it month ago and i still cant open it. The seller lied about the unlock and didnt help when we asked him to.	0
It says its will come unlocked it didnt I dont think u should sale something that says ( unlocked) and it turns out to be locked . Worst phone every and Im going to send it back and I do want my money back ............	0
It seems its a stolen or lost product.. I see messages from the phone owner's dad messages.. I am not going to use it.. Please don't sell stolen products here:-(	0
"It seems ok, it&apos;s been used a lot and in rough shape. I need something for back up when other phones break down."	0
it sells without a charger very bad condition it charges you for an express shipment and it takes more than what was said in my very bad experience	0
It shipped fast but once I got it it doesn't work and I sent several emails to ask for help but get no response. I will be returning tomm if I don't get a response today.   	0
It simply did not work! The electronic boards were Bad!	0
It stopped working	0
"It sucks. Can not load the phone with the case on, slashing down ...    No recomendable esta carcasa.Decepcionante."	0
It takes a little getting used to coming from an android phone. But it&apos;s a solid phone that can compete with flagship phones. Cortana works way better than I could ever expect. The camera is excellent and having a dedicated camera button is a real plus. The audio for music is not great but you are going to use a headphone anyway.	1
It took 4ever to be delivered. I wasnt happy	0
it took awhile  to search a smart phone. finally found it and the seller has a very good bargain+ item quality! fast shipping and good business	1
It took more than a month to receive I refused the item and waiting for a refund 	0
"It took to send the phone, I got blocked, I send it back, he received it and he has not reimbursed me in 5 days and he does not answer my messages !!! Swindler!! "	0
It turned off and never turned back on 	0
It unfortunately came without a SIM card.  I took it to an AT&T store where the employee inserted a brand new SIM card.  He couldn't even get the phone to work!	0
it was a badly refurbished phone waste of time	0
it was a change in phone companie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	1
It was a counterfeit!	0
"It was a European phone that ""Could Not"" use a USA Sim Card."	0
It was a gift for my 16 year old daughter. She instantly fell in love with this mobile as it is very user friendly and has a great appeal for the younger generation!!  It was an obvious choice for me as I have bought other things from this seller and he is really nice!	1
It was a good phone..They had a good price for it. On top of that it was fast shipping...Great people to buy from..The best I delt with so far.	1
it was a great buy	1
It was a great price on a new looking phone	1
It was a great purchase everything works great and has minor scratches but there not bad so its great i am very satisfied	1
"It was a locked unit, and it had a low price, but an shipping price o $18.00. I didn&apos;t catch the shipping price until too late. I checked the shippers record, and it was not great. I gave it away and counted it a total loss."	0
It was a nice price for an LG flip phone for my husband to use. We received it super fast during the holiday. Very Happy!	1
It was a piece of crap. The seller could not have possibly tested it. It shut down constantly and after 3 days I returned it	0
It was a pleasure doing business with you	1
It was a really bad experience because the touch screen doesn&apos;t work when you touch it lightly you have to  touch it very hard lots of times than it works and it goes off when your in a middle of a conversation.So I give it 1/5 at every thing.	0
It was a steal i took a risk cause there were no pictures but came out on top with a last second bid.	0
"It was a used, broken phone. The seller lied to me and refused to give me a refund. What a waste of money.. Buyers beware!"	0
It was a very good phone but it was not the right phone carrier. It was a Verizon carrier phone but I did not want Verizon because that is not the phone service that I have.	0
It was a very nice phone- looked almost new.  Great buy and when I need another phone I will probably get another one off of e-bay.	1
It was advertised as 32Gs and there was only 3 on the device.	0
"It was advertised as an lgcu500v, but it is an lgcu500, I can&apos;t get my aol e-mail on the lgcu500! Next time please-advertise the item correctly, this is very important! I wish to send it back, but the seller said no refund-not good!"	0
it was amazing to get this nice phone i will recommend it for my friends  nice shape and features and comparing to other i believe it will win	1
"It was an s6, just not the same model number, and didn't work on U.S. cellular as said in description. 2 Stars just for good communication about this and paying my money back. It was a large hassle overall with the setbacks this caused and time gone fixing it. "	0
It was as good as it was described. And the shipping arrived at the same day and the same time it was mentioned. Good service.	1
It was bought for an 8 year old boy .good starter phone water proof and shock proof. Highly recommend as a starter phone.	1
"It was brand new out of the original box and works fine.  It is branded AT&T and we are T-Mobile, but it works.  There are a few things that my granddaughter cannot get to work like her older Note 5, security code, but she is happy with the phone otherwise.  "	1
it was damaged when received but its fine 	0
It was defective	0
It was definitely a good deal 	1

It was in great condition.  I had just received it last week.  Have not tried it yet as it is a Christmas gift.	1
It was junk and took me forever to get my money back. I would say do not buy from this person. I had to go threw EBAY to help get it taken care of.	0
"it was just as i expected,easy to use the price was reasonable,i needed phone but didnt want to pay full price at the store"	1
it was just like you said.............................................................................................................................................	1

"It was my worst decision, because I never received my iphone.  I payed for it, inmediately, but I was swindle for people that I think that were honest.  I decided never buy for Ebay.  I lost my money.  I`m very upset."	0
"It was never delivery to the wrong address, "	0
It was nice condition and works perfectly.	1
It was not a 128gb like it said on the post its a 16gb	0
It was not a unlocked phone. Verizon which is my carrier said it was locked and in with another carrier. 	0
it was not at all what I thought I was buying. Had to buy new battery for it before I could use it. Tried to contact seller they we're unreachable.  I was not satisfied at all with this experience. 	0
"It was not jet black, it was blach"	0
It was not unlocked and the company could not tell me how to fix it. After 2 weeks I finally got a refund. Obviously a foreign company who buys refurbished phones and not new as advertised. 	0
"It was not what was listed. The seller won&apos;t respond to me, so basically I&apos;m stuck with something that I don&apos;t want and can&apos;t even use"	0
"It was ok but it has a crack in the screen right over the battery indicator and not a tiny one. I opted for a good condition one instead of a fair condition one and was very disappointed to receive one with a cracked screen. Especially since I paid over 300 dollars for it, other then that its good."	0
It was on airplane mode and the phone almost died by the end of the day	0
It was perfect condition as described. Working perfect!! 	1
"It was purchased as a gift.You can d many things with this kind of phone. It can be used as phone, camera and also can text,take pictures."	1
"it was really a  fake purchase , the seller never sent the product. ( paypal refunded  me the money )"	0
It was received on a timely matter did run into a little problem seller corrected issue promptlyand I was very please with my sevice and item	1
It was sell as unlocked but it was unblocked so you can use the menus but it was network locked	0
"it was shown on small photo couldnt show properly but when seen the item closer  in real life oh its grubby too old to use it, fit for scrap not worth it!"	0
It was sold as new and was a refab that came in a box marked black Onyx and it was gold. There was also a few missing pixels and a tiny crack on the phone. 	0
It was still registered to a previous owner and not usable	0
"It was suppose to work with AT&amp;T but, it dosesn&apos;t. I have tried every available cell phone provider and I still have not found one that will work with this cell phone in my area."	0
"It was supposed to be a new phone, no owners manual,   On top of that it does NOT work. ITS TRASH!!! I will never purchase a Motorola product again EVER.                                                           Thanks for the JUNK,                                                   Rand McClain"	0
"It was supposed to have 32 GB storage but it allows me to download only a few MB of data and then gives a message: ""out of storage space.""  "	0
It was the Best gift to my friend. She was really happy.	1
"It was the same as the other phone I use to have that the screen went blank on, which I only owned for 1 year 5 months.  When I received the new phone, which was used, it started giving me a hard time shutting off, it would cut out while I was talking and now it wasn&apos;t the server.  Sometimes you can&apos;t dial out it won&apos;t let you, you literally have to take the battery our of the phone and reboot it. I will not buy another Sony Ericsson product again, if this is what they offer."	0
"it was time to upgrade but i wasnt ready, then i found out the band could have different frequencies between uk and Canada so they became baby toys"	0
It was used by a person an is unable to use it until that person all's assurance a n clears it	0
It was very disappointing to find this is such a bad seller. I accepted the buy it now price and payed right away only to have the seller cancel the transaction. Sellers like this give eBay a bad name. 	0
"It was what I asked for. Wish i had read closer about the screen being removed, but the phone works fine."	1
It was what my daughter needed and it was her favorite color She loves the phone  it works great and no problems	1
It was worth buying it now got it for a great price. It works perfectly fine and I am very proud to have gotten this product. The iPhone has no wear or scratches so it was a great by. I would recommend this to another buyer or even a close friend.	1
It was wrapped nicely so nothing could get damaged. The phone was in excellent condition along with the Box. Was the best purchase I bought off of ebay! Would definitely buy from him again. Thank you.	1
it wasnt unlocked i had to pay 20$ for the unlock 	0

"It will not work in UK, waste of money"	0
It work good for a day or so and then the screen went to freezing up and it rolls up and down	0
It worked 1 day with t mobile.  And now it's blocked. 	0
It worked fine at first but now it is froze on the start up screen	0
"It worked fine for two days then after that ,it shut off and I'm not able to turn it back on ,any help would help"	0
It worked for a week then the bottom .5 inch of screen stopped working. I emailed the seller and he told me to factory reset the phone. Now i cant use it at all because it wont go through the setup without the bottom part of the screen working. 	0
"It worked great for few weeks and then died on me. Not sure why? Wouldn't pick up WIFI in my home, would turn on and off on it's own,  Numerous issues. I'm returning it and trying a different one from the same seller. "	0
It works and the phone itself is just as described. However the seller included even the headphones it came with and all the power cords and hook ups! Also the fact that the seller took alot of care and consideration into the packaging to really make sure that the phone arrived just as it was when they posted info about it.

"It&apos;s a Dinosaur but, my wife loves this phone! Very user friendly and very simple to operate. Very satisfied with phone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"	1
It&apos;s a good phone for the money.  I like the touchscreen and the overall feel.  The camera is also fairly decent.  There&apos;s not much more I can say in order to fill up 100 characters.	1
"it&apos;s a great phone , nice look ,i bouht because i had one before and it wirks good ,so i have deciced vto buy another one for my son"	1
"it&apos;s a great phone the sound in it is excelent, the responsivenes is great, you get great hardware for your buck truly a real iphone 5/5s rival the only defect is the android updates are only avalable thru AT&amp;T so if you&apos;re not a costumer you don&apos;t get any updates the camera needs a little teaking to get the best quality pics but it gets the job done"	1
"it&apos;s a great phone, ease to use, tons of features, fear capacity and the battery hold for hours. I love it!"	1
It&apos;s a great phone. Dislike neon lite stays on when chraging phone may bother some people at night. Neon lite make it a great gift for your kids.	1
"It&apos;s a great phone. It&apos;s a lot better than using a flip phone with T9, especially since I send out about 3500-4000 text messages a month. This phone will keep up with me especially since it has a nice keyboard. It&apos;s a very compact phone too, so it sits comfortably in my pocket. It&apos;s a great investment and I can&apos;t wait to activate it!"	1
It&apos;s a nice phone but parts of the phone don&apos;t work the headset and I can&apos;t send it back cause I work from my phone and it would take weeks when I turn it off u can see black spots in the screen and I bout two one for me and my wife it don&apos;t hold good a charge not a good buy.	0

it&apos;s affordable now through ebay  It does&apos;nt have a camera or mp3 player  but for the price and you get a PDA and Phone  that works great!	1
"It&apos;s an old phone, so it doesn&apos;t have internet or any of that. Thats the reason I wanted it, because it&apos;s simple."	1
"It&apos;s beautiful. Phone is full of features. HTC Sense is best desktop for Android mobiles I ever used. Screen is huge. Camera works great. GPS is very fast. Connectivity is as usual, not great nor bad. Phone is fast enough to run any game I&apos;ve loaded."	1
"It&apos;s easy to use, looks great and has many features/apps available for it. I love the camera quality (in my opinion, it takes better pictures than some point and shoot digital cameras I&apos;ve seen). I also like how easy it is for me to check my email, Facebook, etc. It&apos;s like having my laptop with me wherever I go!"	1
It&apos;s ez to handle and it have a camera and it was at a cheap price and I needed a new phone. I like prepaid phone do&apos;thave to deal with contrack	1

It&apos;s old tech phone. Doesn&apos;t have new applications. Lagging behind the current market.  Needs lots of improvement.  Thanks.	0

Item box labeled 1020 yet phone shows model as 909. Also phone didn't come with the  41 Megapixel camera nor any labels showing a Carl Zeiss lens. I wonder if manufacturer and seller are doing whatever means to get your money.

"Item was delivered and I was unable to activate it at AT&T as advertised, so I took it to another carrier to see if I could use it somewhere else.

I sent the seller this information and he said it was ""as advertised"" and it wasn't his fault it wasn't unlocked.  I told him I wanted to send it back because I couldn't do anything with it and he said he wouldn't accept it back and would decline any attempts to refund.

Its a great looking phone but it doesn&apos;t connect with the 3G network its a shame because all the rest of the features are great but without 3G its useless.	0
"its a great phone  thank you,"	1
"Its a great phone easier to text with than the cliq xt. I got this for my wife she had a cliq xt and hated the virtual keyboard but I don&apos;t mind it. Battery life is pretty good for a smart phone. I can go all day and then some on a charge. One of the features i don&apos;t like is the sensitivity of the touch screen as your scrolling you can open apps and or call people accidently, but i guess it will take some getting use to. The Google maps is an excellent feature thats very accurate and better than some stand alone gps units. The interface with facebook is good and i like Motoblur cause you can backup all your contacts and or delete them from the phone if lost or stolen. The Cliq gets better reception than my old Nokia."	1
It's a great phone I love it	1
Its a great phone love it it arrived when expected and i had no problems with it great phone for the money thanks.	1

"its a nice phone but there&apos;s too many things i dont like about this phone first of all it dont send pictures messages nor receives them. it all has to be done by e-mail let me tell them something most people dont have an e-mail and those who do only use it to login to MySpace and FaceBook others wont mind taking their time sending pictures to your e-mail, thats a big negative all phones should be capable of sending and receiving pics. another thing texting the letters are too close to each other you do more misspells than what you text, there&apos;s not enough settings to be able to personalize your phone to your style. i bought it for my gf neither she liked it."	0
its a nice phone if you like the phone freezing up all the time and shutting down. would not recommend this phone to anyone.	0

It's a very good phone for the money 	1
Its a very nice phone for a used phone. I was suprised no scratches. The phone works great. I would purchase another one just like it if I could.	1
"It's absolutely worthless for AT&T usage. The MMS overrides the SMS. You can't even send photos from messaging. If you activate any of the verizon features while on a AT&T plan, you can't dial out from the contact list. When dialing out, you have to go to the red messaging  folder and find your contacts there, otherwise when calling out, it will state, ""you do not have enough money on this account, please call verizon or dial some number it gives you."" So if you're on an AT&T plan, don't bother purchasing this phone. If you do, the only thing you're getting is storage, otherwise it's a generic everything with 0 features. I believe this to be false advertising on the sellers behalf. Stipulations should be added as to what you get when you're a AT&T holder.  "	0

"It's commonplace the vast majority of the time to be pleased with the products we purchase on the Internet. You look, you click, you purchase, you cross your fingers. All very non-memorable, a routine we do hundreds of times without a second thought.   It's not often a purchase is actually 'special' enough to want to actually thank the seller. My recent purchase of a cell phone from 'Extreme Discounts' was just that.  I had a question which I posed to the seller, they replied almost instantly.   My purchase was time-sensitive in that it was a birthday gift. I wanted until the last minute to make the purchase and frankly expected the birthday in question to have come and gone prior to my purchase arriving. Much to my surprise, my purchase arrived earlier than the guaranteed delivery date.   The product was magnificently well packed. Frankly, I've never received an electronic device packaged so well. It was clearly obvious the seller prides themselves in selling both high-quality products as well as taking the time to meticulously pack the product for shipment.

"Its easy, fun and the staff is very helpful.I would also tell all my friends and family how great your services are.."	1
It's everything that I wanted in a new phone and the description on Ebay is great. Great communication with seller and fast.	1
It's exactly what I wanted it's fully unlocked and fully functional I did get a no working phone in the first shipment but that's bc they sent me the wrong one but other than that it's was the pretty much the best phone I ever had.	1
Its fantastic phone with proccesser really fast and tons of features lets not mention &quot;3d Pictures&quot; feature its fantasticccc i love this phone.	1
It's funny when people want to sell you their used old phones for the price of the new one. And if this is the 5t then place better images and title for it cause the direct web is only 499.99 for the most current phone.	0
its great !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	1
Its great condition. And I using it. 	1
"It's great, the UI is really good, camera is OK, no lag in most apps, good build... Feels like a premium phone, the screen is also very good. The best phone in it's price range."	1
"It's hard to review a product when the unit does't work!! The phone would'nt charge up so I never had it activated. Had to send unit back to have it exchanged, hope, the other one is better than the first, I think the second one should be sent to me next day air for the inconvenience!,,"	0
"It's IMPOSSIBLE TO ANSWER A CALL. All other TracFones I've had, the Voicemail was on automatically when I turned on the phone, not this one."	0

Its not a good product and also have instructions Chinese language horrible	0
"Its not a phone i would buy again. knowing what i know now. its horribly designed and made with extremely cheap materials. i bought for the price, but its a waste of time. Now i have two useless phones that nobody really wants. Spend a little more money and get your money&apos;s worth."	0

"Its says unlocked but the phone is not unlocked!!! And it&apos;s reported stolen or lost.  I called the phone number of the previous owner but unfortunately it&apos;s already inactive.   I bought this product because he says unlocked nothing else,  Somehow all i can do with this is for parts only."	0
Its small but the screen is great. I wish I could program the thumb print to read multiple fingers. But overall great value. 	1

Its taking TOO LONG to receive. Ive a month!!!!!!! 	0
"Its the best phablet ever.Its slim, nice looking and faster in responding.The battery is alsome, internet is the faster and its as if not a 6&quot;. It easily fits into the pocket, be it the shirt breast or trousers front pockets.The price is fear and it was shipped so fast."	1
It's the best! I've always had iPhones but this one takes the cake!!!	1
Its the worse person I ever purchase anything from since I have been buying on ebay for the last eight years. No one should buy anything from this guy. How can you get my money and say you forget to post the Item?	0
"it's too bad that so many consumers don't recognize quality.  the popularity of Samsung phones speaks to that reality.  Sony in every way is a better phone.  While Samsung focuses on specifications, Sony focuses on Substance, design, balance, and refinement.  I guess what we don't know, is what we don't know.  A comparison in hand of the two phones tells that story.  This phone is water resistant and gives me a huge peace of mind, knowing it can go anywhere, do anything, not worrying about having to protect the phone while being rained on or taking it to the beach.  That said, the Z3 is fast enough for everything, excellent camera, and uses a minimally modified Android Stock OS, with minimal bloatware.  The minute you hold this phone in your hands, you know you got you moneys worth, and not just some hyped up specifications, that looks pretty on paper/outside, but refined and quality in places you can't see and counts as well.  I'm sad to see companies like Sony and HTC do so poorly when it's evident that Samsung isn't as quality a phone, but focus on specs.  Samsung has poor mic, and weak antennas.  While Nokia had the best phone hardware, they are, too, gone.   Apple has great products, quality devices, but terrible phone functions...  meaning taking calls, phone reception/ ant"	1
It's useless to me. I asked for a refund. I sent the product back as soon as possible consideration all the complications I had with the seller after it was approved. Then they changed their minds and refused my refund. Now I don't know where the product is. Maybe in the seller's possession. They also kept the money I sent through PayPal.  A very dissatisfied PREVIOUS customer.	0
"It's very durable but...I had to buy an extra battery because 1- 15 minute conversation will kill a full battery.  I removed all the games and apps I could and it still has very poor battery life even after I bought a new battery for it. Basically I have to leave it plugged in all the time. I liked the idea of all the navigation stuff--problem is if you're not connected to a network the only thing that works is the compass.  It has a mind of it's own.  Volume, and Bluetooth have a tendency to turn on and off all by themselves even when the phone is locked.  The camera isn't all that but I didn't buy it for the camera.  It is durable as I said before. I have a systemic condition where I shake and drop things all the time and I haven't broken this one yet.  My phones usually only last a couple months before the screen shatters but this one is hanging in there."	0
"It's very good. The only things I don't like so far is that I can't figure out a way to set it that the screen turns off after a set time. The only thing I'm able to do is under the security menu there's an option to lock when pressing the end button.   Another problem is that the keypad locks. And when you unlock it, it pops up with a confirmation message which takes a second to go away. But it's still very annoying."	1
It's very slow and delays frequently so not impressed worse Verizon phone I've ever had	0
its was great but some water got into the charger input.  i didnt even get warranty for it!   waste of money	0
Its way to big for an iPhone 6	0

"Its worthless. I did like the fact it did not have a on screen keyboard for typing messages. For the price one would think it had this feature. the touch screen was very hard to use, had to hit it hard in order to use. many of the features like the camera, sound and the numbers stops working when ever it wants to. Need to trash this phone"	0

"I've always been a fan of Motorola products, so I thought this would be a good investment. While I do love the look and feel of this phone, it's a little smaller than I would have liked. Even that wasn't a big deal to me, but the operating system is OLD--- still running of of off Android 2.3 (Gingerbread). There are a LOT of today's apps that are not supported on this OS, such as Tumblr, Lyft, UBER, Yahoomail, etc. I paid about $99 for this phone, which was way too much in my opinion. This was considered cutting edge back in 2009-2010, but the technology has changed significantly since then. Google and Motorola have both abandoned Android 2.3, so there are no further updates. I even rooted this phone, thinking I might be able to possibly get another operating system. CyanogenMod is no more, so I have to wait for some other 3rd party developer to come up with something. Don't waste your money on this, just buy a phone that can handle today's apps and demands. I wish I had done a little more research before I bought this. "	0
Ive always liked the iPhone 6: Its the perfect size for me and does everything I need. I received it 4 days after ordering it and am very pleased.	1
"I've been a longtime fan of the Nexus series of phones and favor them over others for their reliability and uncluttered features, as well as the sizable screen.  To me, the only negligible drawback is the relatively short battery life.  That is overcome with the portable AC and DC charging units."	1
I've been fooled with this purchase since this phone is blocked by UNIVISION asking me for the key and the Apple ID created by this account. I want my money back on the page where the sale was posted it says it was clean as new I feel ripped off	0
"I've been to try to pay but the item it were sold out, l've been writing to the selesman.it's impossible never he wrote me. I want to retire the item,  what could l doing."	0
"I've been using same phone in Android version for 2.5 years.. this Windows phone is horrible. More difficult to use, seems like the phone is trying to be smarter than it really is. To top off the frustration of the windows platform, it seemed to have a weaker signal for music such as Pandora or iheart radio. I didn't even give it a full week before boxing it up and shipping it back. I urge windows users to try out an Android phone.. you'll be a happier person"	0
"I've been using this model for many years, they are very rugged and must be for me to use them.  This one I bought for a backup and have never signed in on it."	1

"I've had 2 LG G4 so far and the same thing happened, great phone until one day it gets stuck. Aftewards, when you try to turn it on again it will show the LG logo forever. "	0
I've had a samsung phone for last 12 years and that is the only brand I'll buy	1
"I've had both the 2&3, bought them brand new. After a year on both phones the speakers went out. Will never buy a Samsung phone again !!!!!!!!!!!!!!"	0
"I've had my Mega 6.3 for a year and it is a great phone!  I had the Galaxy 3 or 4 (can't remember), but had to switch back to this model because I realized this one was way better.  It is definitely a big phone, so for users that need a phone to fit in your pocket, it may not be the one for you.  That would be the only downside.  This phone is very reliable, and it is fast, and has a beautiful screen.  I have been contemplating a Note, but Metro PCS doesn't service them, so I am sticking with my Mega until I find something that is just as good or better!"	1
"I've had the phone for a couple of weeks now and here's my pros and cons: 1. It came without bloatware. This may be because I bought it here on eBay and not Verizon, but it was a clean phone. 2. Unlimited photo storage on Google Photos. Backups are nice. 3. Room for 150,000 songs on Google Play cloud. That's roughly 250G. You can have all of your music in the cloud and stream to all devices. 4. Great camera. It also creates animated GIFs with photos shot in burst mode. 5. Screen is sharp 6. Love the fingerprint sensor on the back 7. USB C for data and charging, and the battery lasts about 20hrs.  Cons: 1. Battery cannot be replaced. 2. No room for microSD, but the free cloud storage makes up for this."	1
"Ive had this phone a week and as of yesterday 7/5/17. It had a full charge, screen flashed a couple times and screen went blank. I tried charging but doesnt work."	0
ive had this phone for about almost 3 weeks now and i love it. it has many features and many more. i love how the phone doesnt lag even though i have tons of things on my memory card. the sound is good and so is the camera. i absolutely recommend it for everyone whos looking for a sleek pda phone.	1
I've had this phone for not even two months and the brain has already died. I would not purchase this phone if I were you!	0
"I've had Windows, Android and iOS devices. Nothing gives you more bang for your buck than the Lumia 650! Good camera, expandable storage, WM10 out of the box - and a nice screen to boot. If you need a good handset without setting you back over $150: consider this phone!"	1
"I've never purchased a phone on ebay before and was a bit worried.. But this seller seems to have done a good job, packaging was safe.  The phone box was not tampered with and it appears completely brand new, no issues at this point!"	1
I've only had the phone for 15 days and the bottom 3 buttons no longer work what the f***!?	0
"I've owned one since launch day. You can't beat this phone, and at this price you can't afford to *not* get it!"	1
I've purchased 2 phones from this seller. I had no problems switching my phone over. Highly recommend.	1
"I've sent msgs to sell many times, but unfortunately no response. I just want to know whether this iphone is a factory unlocked one?"	0
"I've used the Samsung SGH A737 cell phone for years with great success.  They are very small, I can carry them in my shirt pocket.  People like the new ""Smart"" phones but I haven't found a need for a phone which is bigger than my wallet.   Now, because everyone has given up on this model, I can purchase a previously owned phone in ""like new"" condition for under $20.  Unlike the ""Smart"" phones I can remove the battery by sliding off the back cover.  I use the old phone to keep a battery charged. After a couple of days, I can pop the battery out and switch it with a charged battery in seconds.  No waiting for the phone to charge.  When I want to use a new phone of the same model I remove the battery from both phones, I slide out my chip from the old phone and put it into the new phone. I then replace the battery and cover.  In minutes I'm good to go.  The Samsung SGH A737 cell phone is just a great phone for me. The phones last quite a long time but do wear out which is no problem when I can replace it for under $20."	1

"Junk. First it was supposed seal new from factory. After transfering all datas from my old phone, essential basically lost all my contacts over night! The so called 5.7in screen has the same viewing area as 5.5in! What sort of hoax magic is essential pulling here???? I regretfully spent time and money on this junk. Should have spend a little more on Huawei or OnePlus or even s9!"	0
"Just a good basic phone. Has all the features I want, EXCEPT POSSIBLY a camera, but if I had really wanted a camera, I&apos;d have chosen a different phone.  I&apos;ve used another one and like this one much better."	1
Just a terrific phone and in near new condition.. We love it and are glad we got such a great deal on Ebay.	1
"Just another Motorola razr just amped up a bit. Didn&apos;t really impress me much.. same old tired ringtones. The keypad was a bit more spacy but the display didn&apos;t show anything special. An example of a phone behind in the times especially compared to the new phones today.. Phone did have a nice feel not like the flimsy plastic of some flips. Didn&apos;t get a chance to try out all the apps as the phone I bought was someones cast off, reported to be in good shape but it was junk. Buyer beware especially if you deal with eBayer idexxishome..."	0

Just as the title says this is a good price for phone but quality not so much. Sometimes these phones are gambles if you don't get a fast processer. My last phone lasted 1 and a half. But after 9 refurbished phones I learned it's all about luck.. 	0

Just says it&apos;s for parts still not sure to indicate it cannot be powered on. I bought it out of misleading description. The picture used is misleading too for it indicates a normal and intact photo of the photo of both sides. I know the seller even skip some description once it was relisted. I just don&apos;t appreciate the near deception listing like this.	0

"Le iphone est suppos tre unlocked et il ne l'est pas. Aprs 3 semaines a acheter des dverrouillages sur internet, le serveur de Rogers est toujours DOWN! Le vendeur tait suppos me payer la une partie du dverrouillage et jamais il ne l'a fait mme si je me suis fait avoir sur un site o ils ne remboursaient pas. J'ai contact le vendeur pour retourner la marchandise et le vendeur ne me rpond plus. Il n'y a aucun vendeur Rogers dans ma rgion et le signal ne passe quand je vais en Gaspsie. J'ai donc un forfait avec TELUS et pour faire dverrouiller le iphone, j'ai du prendre un contrat de 3 mois pour que je puisse faire dverrouiller le iphone aprs. Pendant ce temps, tant donn que j'avais dj vendu mon cellulaire que je possdait, j'ai du m'en racheter un autre parce que impossible de vivre sans tlphone.

Lenovo A916 is a perfect phone. I'am still discovering its huge applications and enjoying it	1
Less than 3 months after purchasing the phone quit responding to the touch screen and isnt able to make or receive calls. I have to put out $300 to get it fixed - I could have purchased a new phone under warranty by the time I bought both together. Perhaps its just bad luck but I would buy new next time. 	0
"Let me preface this review by saying I am a device and tech hound. I am coming from a perfectly good Galaxy S5 and choose to pay full price for an upgrade. It was worth every penny and don't regret the decision one bit.  The first thing that grabs you about this phone is the awesome build quality of the phone. This is a first rate device no question. As good as anything the boys from Cupertino can put out. The phone is sleek and has a super high quality feeling in your hand. Not that the S5 was bad but this is like comparing a Toyota to Lexus in terms of materials and fit/finish. As an iPad Air 2 owner I can say this device has a feel just as premium if not more so. The stylus clicks into place with a satisfying sound as well and functions well even though I use an Otterbox. The wireless charging feature also works fine through the Otterbox.  Performance, this thing is a beast. Eight cores, 4 GB of ram as much as my 3 year old HP Elitebook might I add. A screen resolution so crisp and clear the colors literally jump out at you. The ability to multi task and run several apps at once is incredible. It blows the doors off the S5 in every performance measure and packs a nice large screen in a relatively small package. I love the 5.7 inch screen size and is notably bigger than the 5.1"	1
"Let&apos;s face it: The ONLY reason a person buys this product is for it&apos;s durability. There are no bells and whistles, it&apos;s functions are basic, it&apos;s heavier, bulkier and more unnattractive. I knew this when I paid it&apos;s higher pricetag but I counted on the fact that even if it did fail (as some reviewers said it did) that I was guaranteed a new phone fast. Bottom line? My screen broke within a month, the microphone went within 4 or 5months and the speakerphone option was always so poor as to be unfuntional. I turned in the phone and have now been waiting a month to receive a replacement. If I could walkaway with even SOME of my money that I paid - I would. In retrospect I now know that the iPhone has a cover that protects it from a two story fall (but not water) and Verizon has some military rugged phone that I could&apos;ve unlocked. All for a similar price."	0

LG Lotus is a good phone.  It&apos;s a flip phone that has a QWERTY keyboard.  Much thinner than most phones with similar keyboards that have the slide out function.  Large LCD screen for easy reading the good feel with buttons that don&apos;t mesh together while inputing or texting.	1

"LG V20 is the third LG phone I have ever used. I moved my choice from LG V10 when it went into a boot-loop suddenly. In my personal opinion, this phone will go a long way with me. Small form and slim feel, a real working beast. I wish it came with a more powerful battery."	1
"LG&apos;s first phone for Sprint with Nextel Direct Connect push-to-talk service. This clamshell phone also features dual color displays, instant messaging, and photo geo-tagging. Other features include EVDO data, GPS navigation, 1 megapixel camera, Bluetooth, and email."	1

"Lightweight, durable, decent memory.  Great functionality and easy accessibility.  I love this phone! I want my next phone to be this awesome!!!"	1
"Like a brand new phone! Functions perfectly, unblemished in appearance. I couldn't be more pleased. "	1
like and love it    no dislikes    i bought it because i won and it was a nice.... well taken care of and something told me to get it so i did basically	1
like everything about phone .	1
like it... it looks like it never been used... i bought this for a gift to my friend cause he asked me if he can have my iphone 4 but i still used it so i decided to buy another one for him since there no iphone 5 yet.. this is great &amp; still working in a good condition ...	1
Like new great product works good the condition was accurate to the disciption provided many features work better that noted. product works great for the money that I purchase.	1
Like New received the product as described and in time. I would definitely recommend for others. 	1
like new...works great	1
"Like simple cellphones, easy to carry, and always trust the motorola quality, the price was acceptable, so did buy and it works perfectly"	1
Like the phone but it is a little hard to learn. Never had one before so it will take some time but good so far.	1
Like the phone. Very nice quality. Takes great pics for a cell phone!! Fiance dropped other phone in tranny fluid then it got slightly ran over so we needed a cheap replacement b/c of the work hazards of his job!	1
"Like the size, weight, screen is beautiful, camera rocks! Android 2.2 and future upgrade to 2.3 is fantastic!    Don&apos;t like the fact that unless phone is rooted, one must actually keep the standard programs installed and can&apos;t remove them.  I HATE FACEBOOK!"	1
"Like the small size, fits in pocket. Newer phones are too big"	1
like this cell phone my phone broken 	1
"Like: This was my 1st touchscreen phone, so I was very excited!    Dislike:   1. The speakerphone is a huge disappointment. I can barely hear the caller.  2. While typing the message, the keys can &quot;sometimes&quot; have a mind of their own. 3. The phone&apos;s charging port cover is very very fragile. It cracked within 2 weeks of using the phone and broke by the 3rd week.    Would not recommend purchasing this phone/model :("	0
LIKED IT VERY MUCH GOOD PRICE IM NOT SURE ABOUT HOW LONG THE BATTERY WILL LAST IT WAS VERY HELPFULL THAT IT HAD A BOOK WITH IT	1
"Liked the honesty of the seller, did not care for the ringtones in it, but have already changed that.  I bought it because it was what I was looking for at a decent price. I could buy this phone for what it was going to cost to fix my old phone.  Very happy with purchase."	1
"Likes: This seller was amazing. Very prompt in responding, answered all of my questions in extremely timely manor. Seller was very polite, the product I ordered is brand new. I would buy from this seller a thousand times more. Based on this experience alone, just seeing this sellers name without even having a top rated seal, I would buy immediately. The tracking number showed up immediately so I can watch each step!    Dislikes: The only dislike I have is that I didn&apos;t find this seller sooner! Perfect transaction!"	1

"listed a icloud locked phone but not descripte this condition, i told him must turn off the icloud, he just open a unpaid case, i believe this phone was stolen and he is a cheater, do not trust this seller"	0
"listen, i bought this phone so that i can use with my sim card. now this phone was shiped to me and i realized the phone has no sim card slot. its such a bad deal i have ever had."	0
"Listing stated device is seller refurbished, but phone came with tons of scratches, dirt caked in the back cover by the camera and by the volume buttons, a crack in the plastic by the call end button, and plastic missing by the volume button. Device didnt seem very refurbished unless your idea of refurbishing is shipping a heavily used phone and putting plastic over the screen that is heavily scuffed/scratched."	0
"Literally the best smart phone I've ever used (in 8 years) destroys the iPhone, moto G gen 4 and the bench marks would kill almost any other phone from the same year 2015  but for being a year old and having this clear a camera and bone stock android it's AMAZING! My friend is buying one tomorrow and my girlfriend just ordered hers. 11/10 stars would recommend."	1
Literally would prefer the original Nokia flip phone (circa 1997) to this piece of $&%t!	0
Little to no scratches. Works great. Very pleased	1

locked device and seller unable to provide unlock information	0
"Locked to Sprint - impossible to unlock.  Apple sends to Sprint.  Sprint tells that one should have an account to unlock.  When unlocked (after finding someone with the active account), it is unlocked for use outside US.  In the USA one can use it only with Sprint."	0
Locks up and must be reset much like the iphone when used as a hot spot. Not bad for what it is. Can&apos;t think of much else to take its place...	0
LONG BATTERY LIFE!!!!	1
"long story short, he is a crook, he sold me a lost or stolen phone that was icloud locked"	0
Longer battery life.	0
Look out he will Rip you off. 	1
"Looked great but then I noticed the power button was stuck and didn't click like the volume did. So I did my research and found that the button was supposed to click.... Then, I thought it was not that bad... But a day after, the phone asked for an Android update, so I hit accept and that was the end of it...  Phone started restarting indefinitely and never came back after charging overnight. "	0
"Looked like the phone was fine at first then. It would just die with still a good amount of charge... Next sometimes it would randomly just restart, then restart again or again..or not. Battery life  now sucked goes down fast or didn't even charge all the way or took a while to charge (fast charging??!!!) seller didn't accept returns also"	0
Looking for a great smartphone in a thin lightweight package? This is the phone for you. The Galaxy S2 Epic 4G Touch from Sprint is your best bang for your buck. Plenty of features to keep you going and the ease of use is second to none.	1
Looking for note 9 came across two different sellers with the identical review from two separate locations by the same reviewer. 	1
"Looking to upgrade but not necessarily to the latest model. Had a 5C with a dying battery and decided to upgrade to this, instead of replacing the battery. So far so good.   Received phone in condition as described, refurbished. If there were any imperfections, a screen protector and case would cover it up. Out of sight out of mind as long as it works. Can't beat the price, a fraction of a new/latest model. "	1
Looks and works like new.	1
"Looks brand new, no issues at all with it! Switched from an iPhone 6 and it sure feels like an upgrade! Camera is obviously not as good as iPhone but everything else is, and I got it for a quarter of the price!"	1
looks good  thats all performance is bad its a load of crap bought for wife she wanted one she got one now put in draw to rot has got a nokia now thank god	0
looks great and works great. ill rate it a 7 out of 10. nice and skinny in your pocket. i would like to see a bigger screen.but thats about it. its realy easy to use	1
Looks great.  Thanks 	1
"Looks like a brand new phone, already has a screen protector on it! My daughter is going to be very excited on Christmas "	1
"Looks like a Note 4, Runs like a really outdated android. This is not a legitimate Samsung Galaxy Note 4(as advertised) and I would know, because I was trying to replace the one I owned and regularly used for 4 years. ONLY GAVE 1 STAR BECAUSE I CAN'T GIVE 0 STARS"	0
"Looks lux, and worth the price tag. Came with all accessories as noted and in the condition described."	1

lOTUS PHONE ESPECIALLY THE RED ARE PRETTY AND THEY ARE SO USEABLE FOR MANY THINGS I LOVE THE KEYBOARD	1
"Love all the features, speaker volume has it hands down vs my old Iphone 4. However, the most important item, signal strength is soooo poor it's super frustrating. Constantly goes into roaming and dropping calls. I am close to a tower. I still have my Iphone activated on the same network, both on Sprint, and my Iphone's signal strength is always 20 dBm better. No problems with it anywhere. Will probably go back to old Iphone if I cannot find a solution. Brought it to the Sprint store. No help other than wanting to sell me another phone. Ugh!!!!"	0
Love every thing about my phone.........................................................................................................................	1
Love everything about it! It was a little bigger than I had expected but thats not a bad thing! I decided to buy it because I never owned a smart phone before and will never go back to anything else. So many free apps and 7 home screens!!!	1
Love everything about this phone! Worth every penny!	1

"Love it! Does everything I want and more! Great battery life. Bought it refurbished, so I was a little skeptical but works just fine. Love the how functional it is, and it looks great. Always wanted a Bold, and finally got one. Highly recommend, especially if you check e mails regularly."	1
"Love it! Perfect for young child. You control who they can call and who can call them. Also has 911 feature that cannot be accidentally engaged. Works with at&amp;t pay-as-you-go prepaid service (so approx $100/year). Highly recommend getting this for a child you drop off at soccer, etc."	1

Love need more items like this	1
"Love the capabilities of the phone, but be aware that Verizon charges an extra $30 per month to upgrade to a Smartphone. Devour has all apps of Smartphones and is more sturdy than Droid. Bought it because we researched the phone and liked its abilities. Devour is sleek and easy to use."	1
"LOVE THE E815&apos;S LARGE KEY PAD,CAMERA AND BLUETOOTH CAPABILITY.IT&apos;S A PERFECT PHONE FOR MY NEEDS AND I BELIEVE FOR ANYONE WANTING A GOOD CELL PHONE"	1
Love the finger touch security feature. Great phone. Great battery life. Very easy to use	1
Love the IO system  I had both android and Apple. Apple by far better in security and overall operation Take Apple by far.  Have had android first.  Apple overall best.	1
Love the keypad and ease of use.	1
"Love the look, the blue lighted keypad, the flashlight feature is a life saver for finding things in the bottom of your purse or lighting your walkway when you get home late. Tons of options and features, every one of them great. I have nothing bad to say about this phone at all. My husband loves it to death (it&apos;s his phone, I just love to play with it LOL). My mother bought this for him at Wal-Mart as a $30 pre-paid cell phone and it&apos;s been worth every penny!!! It&apos;s the exact same phone my sister-in-law has through Verizon and she loves hers too! My advice, if you&apos;re thinking about getting this phone...DO IT!!!"	1
Love the notes ... bigger screen for those size queens... love love love .. yes I love my note  	1

love the phone when I first got it worked great for a while after 2 months the phone stopped working it turns on but a blank screen ended up losing a month of service which I just payed for a week ago. so now I have to buy a new phone still have it and when I received it there was a crack in the screen maybe it happened during shipment. and when it was working when I made calls my screen went blank called t mobile and they did a systems check and it said everything was up to date and to restore my phone to factory settings and that did not help.	0
Love the phone! Came just as described! Seller was great in keeping in contact and answering any questions I had!! Would recommend this seller and buy from them again!	1
Love the phone! No issues with the phone as of now. Great durable phone. I needed a phone that would last me for a while &amp; this seems like the perfect phone for my business. I constantly drop my phone so I think this one will last me for a long time &amp; the fact that it is also water resistant makes it even better!	1
"love the phone, also use it as my mp3 player while running. dropped and broke the last one while working-out but liked it so much that I bought another."	1
"Love The Phone, have it for a month so far and is great, text messaging laggy sometimes but still great."	1
Love the phone.  Learning more about it everyday.  Thanks	1
"Love the phone. Great feel and size, takes quality pix, easy to use, voice controls anything you ask of her.  At this price for this much memory you cannot go wrong!"	1
"Love the phone. If you like flip phones, this is the one. Rugged and sleek. "	1
Love the price and item was as advertised.  Was able to put my SIM card in and charge it and go!  Easy transaction through it all!	1
Love the product because it is unlock and it works perfectly.The seller was true to his word and i hope to do business with him in the future. Thanks a lot.	1
Love the product! Works great and make my Job a whole lot easier. Lots of tools to work with. And the seller sent me a Top Rate! A Grade Unit! I couldn&apos;t be Happier!	1
"Love the screen size. It's perfect! Much better than any Android phone, including the S8. Get an iPhone! You won't regret it. "	1
Love the sleek design.  Easy layout of keys and easy to navigate through menus.  Camera is better than most other flip cell phones.    Would buy again.	1
"Love the thin design, huge internal space, as well as dual SIM. Camera takes beautiful pics. My favorite phone thus so far. Would definitely recommend to friends and family."	1
Love the unlimited photo storage with Google. Smooth navigation with nice now playing for music. 	1
love these little phones..even though ATT no longer sells them or the proper holster....battery last good...very durable....camera leaves a little to be desired.....glad these are readily available on e-bay...i have 2 for spares and would buy another when needed....ty	1
Love this iPhone better than any other one I've ever had and have been an apple customer for years. 	1
LOVE THIS ITEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	1
Love this phone - I may be old school but I appreciate the dependability and longevity - don't need a new improved version every time something comes out.  If it aint broke don't fix (or change) it.  I have had this phone since 2004 (when Cingular was still around) - It is still working but like myself is beginning to show it's age  I get teased a lot but I LOVE this phone and as long as I can find one out there still working I will continue to have this model phone -  thank you eBay :)	1
"Love this phone , my daughter is gonna flip out over this phone it was brand new nothing wrong with it!!! Great seller!!!"	1
Love this phone and I can't believe how quickly I got use to the 6 inch screen.	1
love this phone battery last all day dont freeze up and takes 30 min to fully charge awesome phone fast downloads and awesome pics just a awesome phone	1
Love this phone got it because of the ruggedness and love flip phones. Good camera good sound. only thing i don&apos;t like is there is no way to silence call when phone is closed. But a great phone for the price. especially good for someone in the construction business where phones take a beating.	1
Love this phone iv'e had lots of phones but None like this one.	1
love this phone the screen is amazing the windows phone 8.1 Is smooth the apps are getting better which just adds to the value	1
"Love this phone!  Bought it because my old phone was worse than obsolete at greater than 2 1/2 years old.  I love the size, shape and contour of this phone.  It actually feels good to hold in your hand.  Most new top of line smartphones are way too large to fit comfortably in your pocket. Would definitely buy again.  Only thing I don&apos;t like is like most new phone models now there is no micro-SD slot to add memory. Also not happy that Google recently sold Motorola to Lenovo a chinese company.  Glad that my phone was manufactured in USA."	1
Love this phone!  Takes a nice picture and has great color.  The pink is just a great shade.  Every girl or guy could carry with just about anything.	1
"Love this phone!  Works great, love the size and the look."	1
"Love this phone! great reception and battery life-love the slide out keyboard. Using the internet is a little clunky, but hey! This isn&apos;t a smartphone..."	1
"Love this phone! Just purchased another one for my husband for Christmas.  If you love your razor you&apos;ll love this slimmer version of the same.  Easy to use.  Takes great pictures and is easy to thumb through.  Sleek look with a glass front.  Fits nicely in pocket.  Also  when turned up is easy to hear even if in your purse. Unlike my last two phones its loud and clear.  You can also buy the cable and download tunes for ring tones.  I can&apos;t think of any downfalls yet except for the glass front is easily cracked. Buy a cover for this baby, treat it well and it will reward you with great service! Hope this helps you decide.  Desi"	1
Love this phone! The battery stays charged all day and I'm on it a lot!	1
"Love this phone! Works great with Boost, downloadable applications, switch between applications easily, sync contacts with yahoo.  Has everything I could ask for in a phone."	1
"Love this phone!!!  Missed the querty keyboard, this one has it!  Takes good pictures!  Havened had any problems downloading apps, alot of memory!  The battery life on this phone is great!  last 2days!!  Great android phone!!  Will use until something really SUPER BETTER comes along!!  Can do everything with this phone!"	1
"Love this phone!!! It took much debate with boost to get a new sim, but i finally got it up and running with little to no problems..... Seller is great and the phone is like new with no scratches or blemishes whatsoever!!! Recommend this seller to anyone needing a new phone... Cause it is new... Thx!!"	1
Love this phone!I needed a cell phone - not a smart phone and this is so much easier to use than my previous samsung phone.  It is easy to text with  and the call quality is good. I would recommend this phone to anyone who needs a easy to use phone for texting and calling.	1
"Love this phone,It&apos;s easy to use and has everything I need.It scrolls easy and things are easy to find and to set up.It works with straight talk wich I have now and it hast great service."	1
love this phone.  it did take some getting used to.  it is like a mini computer afterall.... but it&apos;s a great phone.    no one can even tell I bought it used.  there were no scratches or signs of wear anywhere on it    if your looking for a do anything phone this IS IT!!!	1
LOVE THIS PHONE. Disable some of the battery guzzling functions and it really makes me not regret switching from the iPhone (primary reason is the physical keyboard). 	1
"Love this phone. Easy to use, great features.  HTC has outdone themselves with this phone.  It is the best android phone ever."	1
Love this phone. Great feel in the hand and a great camera! I can see why they call it the pixel. 	1
Love this phone. It was delivered quickly exactly as advertised. I would definitely recommend. Brand new still in original packaging with stickers and wrapped on the items in the box. This phone was unlocked. I am really happy with it so far and super pleased with this purchase.	1
"Love this phone. Unfortunately one of ours fell into the dreaded boot loop and had to be replaced. I am not ready to upgrade though, because this is such a good device otherwise. "	1
"Love this phone... Great for texting,  super thin and light weight and the internet is REALLY FAST!  I was using an HTC TILT and before that the MOTO Q.  Liked the internet speed of the TILT,  but the phone was extremely complicated and SOOO HEAVY and BULKY.  The Q was way more user friendly but had the slowest internet I&apos;d ever used.  THE PANTECH SLATE is the best of both worlds!  Thinnest, Lightest QWERTY keyboard phone EVER,  with a very USER FRIENDLY MENU and LIGHTNING FAST INTERNET CONNECTION. I AM VERY VERY PLEASED WITH THIS PHONE!"	1
Love this product!  It was exactly as promised! Thank you!	1
Love this purchase. Got this for my mom who needed bigger and clearer letters. She is so thankful for being able to see better.	1

"Love, love, love this phone.  Actually haven&apos;t used it for a phone but more like a mini computer MP3 player and to play games.  It connects online so you don&apos;t need the Phone contract if you have WiFi and just want to play the games on it.  We don&apos;t have a phone contract with it so we can&apos;t receive or place calls, but we have enjoyed using it for Music, Games and web browsing.  The only thing I could say that I don&apos;t like is that the speaker could be louder when listening, but it&apos;s actually quite good for it&apos;s size. :)"	1
"Love, love, love this phone. I do not use/want a smart as for my intents and purpose a basic flip phone is for me. I love the fact that it is wind, shock, and water proof and if I feel the need to get on the internet, I have that capability with a pay as you use deal. The one drawback, if you consider that a drawback is the camera doesnt take ""immediate"" shots. Once you clic to take the photo the camera/phone takes an additional 2 seconds to actually take the photo. I am not a photographer so no biggie. I had a Casio Gzone a while back and loved it and this phone is almost a clone of that one with better styling. Verizon wanted 49.99 for this phone plus 40.00 extra for hookup, and I would have to have agreed to a 2yr contract. I have been a loyal verizon customer for over 20 yrs and have never missed a bill and have not been on a contract for quite some time. I bought this phone that I wanted off ebay and it was less than what verizon was going to charge and no contract! No brainer. Thank you"	1
"Love: Size, style, functionality    Dislike: Camera is pretty marginal with low quality images. Battery seems to run down quickly and I have to charge it about every other day.     Actually, my first 5310 failed after about a year and wouldn&apos;t charge. The batt was OK, but the tiny charging connector became intermittent and finally failed completely so I had to buy a replacement unit."	1
Loved it at first worked fine for the first month then after that it started having problems my brother in law works for Samsung and he couldn't figure out what was going on with it 	0
"Loved it, great product, great price. Replaced broken one that AT&amp;T was going to charge $50 more. Thank you, .."	1
Loved the full qwerty keyboard but couldn&apos;t download the latest Androd version. Sent the phone back for a refund.	0
Loved the phone exactly as described no issues getting setup. 	1
Loved the phone! It was on time and in perfect brand new condition! I would love to do business with you again! You always replied so fast to all my questions.      Thanks	1
Loved the size and color. Had a scratch across the back bottom. Wouldnt hold a charge. Was sent a battery. Replaced it and found out the battery in the phone was a replacement put in with the wrong screws. Phone still wont hold a charge. Not apple products used. Gets very hot when charging. Have to leave it plugged in so I can accomplish what I need to. Very disappointed. Paid $30.00 to have the battery put in.  I should get that back because it still wont hold a charge. Its going back as soon as I get something as I do not have a land line. 	0
"Lovely big screen and thin. As sold, this comes with Windows Mobile 6.5, which is so so. But thanks to people much clever than I, it&apos;s pretty simple to load Android onto it and turn this phone into more or less the Desire HD. Android can be dual booted with Windows Mobile or loaded directly onto the phone (in NAND is the techy term). Even better, once you&apos;re loading Andorid onto it, there are loads of version to choose from and you can get the very latest versions of Android. No waiting for the phone company to release an upgrade, which is a lot of cases they never do because they&apos;d rather you bought a whole new phone. So it&apos;s eco and wallet friendly ;)"	1

"lThis was by far my worst experience ever,,first it took the phone there weeks to make it being that it got lost In Miami first, finally receive the phone and I switched it to my straighttalk account, the phone works for 30  minutes,, no calls or texts could be made,,I find out through at&amp;t that the phone has been stolen and cannot be us the camera was aweful,, it completely sucked, notto mention I had to payb27 dollars to dens it back to China,, the phone finally made it now I still have to wait three says foe my refund,, worst example experience ever!!"	0
Luv this phone! All the features of the S3 in the S2 size! Comes with less internal memory and is only 3G  capable. Those are the biggest draw backs. But it has the smart stay feature that I loved about the s3 and the size is perfect for smaller hands.  Also this phone supports up to a 64gb sd card so memory isn&apos;t really an issue. Love the navy blue color too. And you can&apos;t beat the price!  Great phone overall.	1
Ma cosa si sono fumati questi? Il raccolto annuale di marijuana nel mondo?!?!?!? $ 85 l'oggetto...... $100.00 LA SPEDIZIONE?!?!?!? MA PER PIACERE!!!!! Mi meraviglio di eBay che accetti/ammetta questa cosa!!!!!	0
"made in uk . factory unlocked. great quality. battery life is mediocre cuz they release these phone back in 2006. i hope the seller put the battery door in . not on the outside cuz if it slightly bent, the door is hard to put in not a good fit. signal strenght is about 87% optimal ."	1
"Made purchase to replace one of the same that no longer took pictures, liked the model. New to me phone was a good price, but screen seems be defective, can still see its display and not worth the effort in sending back..sellers were great."	0
Mailed item timely and quickly.  I received the item in less than 4 days after I wom and paid for it.  The phone was as decribed and it worked without any issues.  Would purchase from this seller again.	1

"Meine Haupt Anforderungen waren:  - Bedienerfreundlich  - Farbdisplay  - Preis unter 40   - Kein Klapp- oder Schiebehandy  - Prepaid    Nach Beratung bin ich auf das Nokia 2310 gestoen. Dieses Handy habe ich fr 20  erworben.  Bedienerfreundlichkeit  -----------------------------  Da ich bisher nur Siemens, Sony oder T-Mobile Handys hatte, war ich tatschlich berrascht wie schnell ich das Nokia Handy bedienen konnte.  Das Handy hat viele &quot;Standart&quot;-Funktionen, die berlegt und ausgefeilt sind (im Vergleich siehe mein Erfahrungsbereich ber den MDA 3) z.B. ist eine Kostenfunktion dabei, oder sinnvolle &quot;Anrufe in Abwesenheitsnotiz&quot; dabei. Das Men ist klar strukturiert.  Weiterhin lsst es sich auf die Bedrfnisse des Nutzers einstellen bzgl. Farben und Tne. Farben und Tne sind sehr umfangreich und auch sehr schn!  Das Handy ist auch sehr leicht.    Mit der Ton- und Empfangsqualitt bin ich sehr zufrieden. Der Gesprchspartner ist gut zu verstehen und auch der Gesprchspartner kann mich gut hren.  SMS  -------  Mit der SMS-Funktion bin ich auch sehr zufrieden. Muss mich allerdings noch umgewhnen, dass das Leerzeichen auf der 0 und nicht auf der 1 ist und die Sonderzeichen links unten und nicht auf der 0 ;)    Signalmitteilungen  -----------------------  Was mir auch sehr positiv aufgefallen ist, das man soviel Tne einstellen kann. Man kann auch Vibration in verschiedenen Varianten einstellen und auch nur Lichtsignale (kannte ich bisher noch nicht).  Radio  ------  Wo ich noch ein paar Worte verlieren mchte ist das Radio. Das Handy hat ein integriertes Radio. Gespannt auf deren Zuverlssigkeit und groe Zweifel habe ich die Probe gemacht: Und tatschlich das Radio hat eine erstaunlich gute Qualitt was Empfang und Ton angeht!    Das Handy ist fr Handy-Einsteiger hervorragend geeignet in unserer modernen Zeit. Es ist gut bedienerfreundlich und alle Funktionen des Handys sind ausgereift. Die Funktionen sind auf ein Minimum reduziert was man wirklich bentigt, deshalb ist auch kein Foto, E-Mail usw. dabei. (ausgenommen Radio)  Ich kann dieses Handy jeden Empfehlen."	1

"Microsoft invented the SmartPhone with PocketPC Phone Edition, and up until Windows Mobile 6.5, it was the most powerful, easy to use, and functional system.  It fully integrated with Outlook and Exchange.  Then, as usual, Apple dumbed everything down to a useless level popularized the Smartphone, stealing the market share and developer base from a product that remains today the best of its kind.    So Microsoft decided it needed to imitate the idiocy.  Windows Phone is an iPhone without apps, because they require a $99 developer fee just to be able to browse its contents.  It has to integrate with Windows Live SkyDrive or sync with Zune, just as iPhone integrates with iCloud or syncs with iTunes.  One would imagine Microsoft would keep their phone systems compatible with Outlook &amp; Exchange.  Not so much.  Exchange support for Windows Phone is identical to that of iPhone and Android.      Sadly, although I find Android lacking, it&apos;s the only option now for a fully featured Smartphone that isn&apos;t enslaved to a corporate notion or how you should be allowed use your phone."	0
"Might have been good in 2016, but now they're slower than molasses in February. Yes it has a nice clear 5.5"" screen but the 1.1ghz quad core is not sufficient at all. Battery life is dismal and in the end it's a good beginner phone but not much else. Spend your hard earned money elsewhere."	0

"My Dad is the type who, when he gets used to something and likes it, that is what he wants to use for now own. Dad got his first Nokia N95 around 5 years ago and told me, &quot;I have tried to get used to some of these newer phones, but they just don&apos;t feel right in my hands like my Nokia did when it was working&quot;, so I got on ebay trying to find one. Fortunately, I was lucky enough to find a Seller who had almost no experience, but ended up performing like a pro and got the phone my Dad has gotten so used to in brand new condition, just like it was advertised.    I do not personally have an opinion on this phone other than when somebody, like my Dad, gets used to a product, and they like the product, nothing else will work as good as they one they had to begin with. The phone is a nice little phone, but it would take some &quot;getting used to&quot; for me, personally, to be able to operate, but other than that, it&apos;s a great little product and Nokia should be proud of it.    On a more personal note, my Dad lives in Uzbekistan, so when he gets to the States, he puts in his &quot;United States Sim Card&quot; and when he gets back to his workplace, he puts in his &quot;Uzbekistan Sim Card&quot; and the phone performed flawlessly, through hundreds of flights in and out of Uzbekistan, with no problem whatsoever, so Nokia did make a winning product considering the phone lasted so long, through so many altitude and environmental changes, for a long 5 years before finally giving in to old age. 2 thumbs up on the Nokia N95 for anyone looking for a good, solid phone to last them for years without problems!"	1

"My experience with this phone is awful. I got this phone last Thursday May 16, 2013. The only thing I did on that day was to open the phone turn it on to see if it was working. It came on fine so I turned it off, took out the battery and went to do some research about the phone. I contacted the seller asking some questions which he could not answer and I did not want to use the phone unless it had an android OS 2.1 or higher. Anyway the seller instructed me to turn on the phone which I did, the phone kept on freezing and on Sunday May 19, 2013, less than a week, the phone froze and that was it. Up to this day I cannot get to use the phone and the seller is of no help. Less than a week and my money is blown. This is not good."	0
my experience with this phone was horrible it cuts on and off often for no reason i regret buying this phone from the seller serously!!!! Never Again	0

"My first ever smartphone was the LG G2, and I owned it for 3 years. I would have loved to continue using it, but it began to misbehave in ways that were difficult to live with. My husband purchased his LG G3 a year and a half ago. So, my debate was, do I purchase the newest LG G5, or do I purchased a new older version, mainly the LG G3. I read so many amazing reviews about this phone, so I decided to search for the best available price. I was able to purchase this phone for a wonderful price, and I also purchased the 2 year Square Trade insurance plan for just a little extra, which still made the phone hundreds of dollars less than the newest model. I have been using the phone now for a month, and I love it! Simple as that. The only problem I experienced after activating it at home with my previous sim card was that ALL of my old text messages from day 1 began to automatically download from the AT&T cloud. I was unable to disable that feature on my phone, so I went to my home computer, logged in to AT&T and disabled it from the main site. My text messages no longer sync to the cloud, but I don't care about that. Don't hesitate. Definitely purchase this phone if it fits all of your criteria. "	1
"My first iPhone.  Works great, looks great, long battery life, love it.  Installed my sin card and off I went. "	1
"My first Smartphone. I have nothing to compare it to, but it was easy to learn to use and operates as I expected.  Have had another Tracfone and they seem to be a very good value."	1

My husband and I have been using this type of LG for the last several years.It is easy to use and is durable.We have had a few quirky things happen with it as it gets older.When those moments happen we just pop out the battery and then put it back in.The problem is solved.We have lost count on the number of times we have dropped it and it still keeps going.When it gets to be over a year and a half or two the flip part starts to get loose and has eventually come apart after it was dropped to hard.Hope we can keep finding this phone on ebay when we need it.	1
My husband bought the phone to take with him over seas. Phone didn&apos;t work when we got it. and there has just been too much bs with the seller. Some how a mix up with the address. They are expecting stuff they bought to come to our address. Just getting tired of dealing with this kind of stuff. When I don&apos;t even get on ebay its my  husband and he isn&apos;t here to deal with everything.	0
My husband didnt want a big phone this is great for him	1
"My husband had a Nokia 6010 and when it bit the dust, I went in search of one just like it. Meanwhile he was given a free replacement, so I got to keep the one I had purchased for him. It doesn&apos;t wash dishes or anything like that, =) but it well serves my purpose and I would buy it again. Enjoyed the whole experience!"	1
"My husband has had this model phone for a couple of years and loves it for its size, ease of use, etc.  So he was upset when he dropped his in the water and fried it. He called Verizon to find they no longer offered the phone and then I found it on this website.  He is so happy to have his Juke again!.  It arrived quickly, in new condition and is as expected."	1
"My husband is not a &quot;smart phone&quot; guy. He needed something old style/flip phone, sharp perception, dependable. The Jitterbug Plus was just what he needed. We were a little mislead or just didn&apos;t understand the extra cost for minutes that we thought were included with the plan. Still, overall, it was much less than what a plan that neither of us need would have cost. We do not live on the phone and just needed something to keep in contact with kids and grandkids. Thank you, Jitterbug and seller. Well worth the purchase. /:-D  We do not use the 5* plan, just the phone service."	1
"My husband lost his XV6800 while on vacation.  Our cellular phone company wanted to charge us $30/month for a data plan if we replaced his phone with a newer smartphone model.  However, since he had a XV6800 previously without the charge and replaced it with the same model, he was able to get the charge waived. Unfortunately, the eBay phone needed to be rebooted 2-3 times per day, which was very frustrating.  In the end, he got a new smartphone."	0
"My husband love the LG K8 phone so when I found this one he was really happy because his LG K8 was ready for retirement ,  when he finds a phone he like he stays with that phone brand .  He gets really great service were we live here in the country."	1
My husband LOVED this phone.  It is the perfect size and everything worked great on it.  It just doesn't work in our beautiful Upper Peninsula of Michigan!  Not the towers needed for it.	1
My husband loves this phone it is like vandalproof It has great features and not delicate loike the rest of the phones out there!!	1
My husband ordered this when I lost my Straight Talk phone and it turned out to be a HUGE NIGHTMARE!!  NO WHERE on the website does it say or indicate the Zip Code it works in (which is a major biggie for S.T.). You have to submit your code to see if that phone will work with your service area.  Now part of this is on S.T. since it took them almost 3 weeks and four people later to figure out this phone will not work in the Midwest.	0
"My husband&apos;s old phone had become obsolete, so he bought a phone from the High St. He was told that it was simple to use - not only was it NOT simple to use but he couldn&apos;t hear it when it rang. I&apos;d recently bought a Motorola V620 and was very happy with it, so we decided to bid for one on EBay for my husband. He is delighted with it! It does everything that he needs - the camera isn&apos;t brilliant but he doesn&apos;t need that!"	1

My last Nokia 3595 died after about three years of abuse so I decided to try ebay for a replacement. The new arrival works great and switching over the memory card was a breeze. I was up and running again in minutes and haven&apos;t had a single problem.	1
"My latest swapout makes this the fourth Sanyo phone that I&apos;ve had, in nearly 10 years with Sprint - and all of them have been excellent.  (Note: The longer you stay with Sprint, the better offers they extend to you on service plans and phone replacements.  Good customer loyalty program.)    My previous Sanyo&apos;s have all been straight-handset models, which I preferred - but the world is going to Flip-Phones, so I decided to put some trust in Brand Experience when making the move.  I haven&apos;t been disappointed.    The 2400 has the Largest Screen that I have ever had on a phone - and the large number display is a relief for aging eyes.  The Separate Keys are far superior to the membrane keyboards I have suffered with on other brands.    Unlike many Flip-Phones, the 2400 has an Extendable Antenna.  You don&apos;t need to extend it in strong signal areas, but out in the fringes it is often the difference between connecting and not connecting.  The 2400&apos;s performance is right up there with the best straight handsets I ever had - definitely superior to those with internal antennas.    I am a traditionalist, who believes a Phone should just be a Phone, as that is what I use it for.  And the 2400 does a fine job as just a Phone.    For those who just HAVE to do Internet, Walkie-Talkie, etc. - the 2400 does support Sprint&apos;s Vision and Ready Link services, with nicely placed controls and easy menus.  Unlike many other modern phones, though, it also has menu options to completely disable those extras - for guys like me, who don&apos;t want to be bothered every time they brush the wrong button.    For those of you who must have a Camera Phone, check out the Sanyo 3100.  Same Case design and size as the 2400, with a 1.3mp digicam in the lid.  Many accessories - such as Belt Holsters, Cases, and Chargers - are interchangeable between the two models.  Both are available in at least five different color schemes (a different five for each model).    The 2400 (and its camera-cousin, the 3100, which my wife has) are both solid performers.  If you&apos;re outfitting the whole family, a blending of these two models should cover everyone&apos;s tastes in both features and colors - with full compatibility of accessories."	1
"My LG G3 dropped working. I went through several steps to rectify the problem, all to no avail. My bright idea was to see if I could get an upgrade cheaper than at the store. I won the auction but was sceptical about how the product would look when and if it arrived. To my surprise it was in excellent condition and arrived before I anticipated. I recommend buying from this seller. My apologies for doubting you. Thanks!"	1
My little girl loves this phone. Gave it to her for communicating with me for getting out of school at different times and she loves the apps and internet settings. Thanks again.	1

"My old phone got wet, so this new one is perfect."	1
"My older model works better than this phone brand new. You can't do anything with apps on it. It's completely obsolete. Even with an additional storage card and with having rooted the phone, it cannot sync and also has a terrible screen/camera with no flash or light available. It acts as though it was released in 2012?! I'm shocked at the quality HTC is willing to release. Very unfortunate"	0
My only problem is the shipping its been in transit for 2 days and it was suppose to be here yesterday. 	0
my order was unlock black phone but you send my metro pcs white phone.	0
"My other S5 broke only a month after I bought it. Lesson learned. I got a case for this one BEFORE I got the phone. It is my favorite Galaxy yet. It does exactly what I need it to, it's a good size, and except for NEEDING to be in a case, it's perfect."	1
My package was not delivered and sent back to the seller. Totally ridiculous.  I have not ever had a problem with my address or shipping with ebay so I dont understand why this happened. 	0
"My phone arrived dead & took a significant amount of time to charge just enough to turn it on. There was damage by the front camera & the rear camera wouldnt focus. There were several apps already open, including a voice memo of someone checking the mic quality. Also, Im not totally sure what model it was, but it wasn't even a 6S. Didnt check much else as Id already decided to send it back."	0
"My phone came as described and worked great at first. However, after 2 months of using the phone, the camera stopped working, the home button stopped working, the screen stopped being receptive to my touch, and the phone stopped sending correct notifications for apps. I have no idea what exactly happened with it, but it was a complete waste of money."	0
My phone do not work	0
"My phone got water damaged so I went on eBay and I bought this phone as a substitute since I use my phone for work everyday. I paid within seconds from winning the auction on this phone, 24 hours passed and I got no notification that it was shipped, I contacted the seller and they said their listing said it would ship in two days (I went through the whole listing and didn't find anything saying that) then they said they were shipping it that night and that didn't happen either, on the third day I messaged the seller again wondering what's going on? They never responded and canceled my order shortly after. Now I still didn't get my money back and my time was nothing but a waste, I'm disappointed I had to give one start since I couldn't give zero stars . I hope everyone reads this before buying from this seller! "	0

My phone is prefect for me.	1
"My phone never arrived and it took me 3 months to get a refund! I had to run around calling the post office setting up investigations and get them to type up statements. The seller was not helpful at all, stalled and I had to finally get eBay to step in and order the refund! Would not buy from them ever!"	0
"My phone order arrived before the expected date and is in great working/looking condition! The sim card holder was missing but once I contacted the seller a new one quickly arrived. The customer service is GREAT,  I am a very satisfied first time customer. "	1
"My phone was dead on arrival. Lately eBay sellers have been minimizing the quality to save money at the expense of their customers' time. Having gone through a similar process on my last eBay phone purchase, I am fed up. Avoid this - this phone was someone else's problem and that's why it's on eBay now."	0
My phone was shipped quickly and the phone is great! Thank you!	1

"My phone works great, so much better than I ever expected!"	1
"My previous phone of the same model died. I didn&apos;t want to learn a new phone. This phone is the perfect replacement. Seller stated condition exactly as it is. Good price for a used phone. This is a basic phone for basic pay-as-I-go calls. It also has the option for upgrades, if I choose to go with a plan that has more bells and whistles."	1
My promble is with the seller not mark the item I brought say shipped and it don't tale more than 24 hours to do so that pour lazy on the seller end if I had a item up for sell I would mark shipped not make people wait on it tha t show not a good seller 	0
"My purchase of a used T62u cell phone, was for my son (who loses, and/or destroys his cell phones a couple times a year).    I didn&apos;t want to spend a lot of money on the phone, that&apos;s why I chose ebay for my purchase.    I selected this phone instead of one of the other phones with all of the bells and whistles (camera, color screen, etc.) for two reasons:    1. The cost    2. Because it was one of the two GAIT phones Cingular ever had. GAIT phones are nolonger available, only digital phones now. GAIT phones have better reception (or more network options for coverage) than the new phones, they pick up Analog, TDMA, and new Digital signals from available towers. This allow reception in areas the digital phones typically don&apos;t have available.    I am happy with my purchase, it was just as described in the listing on ebay, as were the rest of my ebay purchases to date."	1

"My sister uses a $300 Apple Phone and my other sister has a $150 Samsung Phone. Both of them have been through over four phones since 2017. The screens on all of their phones, including the ones at present, are cracked to hell. I bought this phone for $19.99 at the beginning of 2016, dropped from three stories, out of my pocket multiple times, it fell in a fountain, a toilet, and in a puddle, and it has thrived past 5 adolescent and toddler nieces and nephews. This is the phone I use now. It has never died despite being waterlogged, and it still has over 11 hours of battery life on a bad day with full use. About 22 on a good day.  'Nough Said."	1
My son accidently broke his phone and we   needed a replacement . Also it was a good   price  as well as it was new and in good   condition .	1
My son did not want the plus model because he says it is too big for his 12 year old hands. He loves it! 	1
My son is very happy with his new phone.  He&apos;d had several others by a different manufacturer and all had the same issues within a very short period of time after receiving them.  I&apos;ve carried Motorola equipment for years and swear by their product.  We looked for hours and finally settled on this one.  The price was great and he is very please with the quality of service this product is giving him.  Yeah Ebay!	1
My son loves his new phone. He did receive the wrong color but he ended liking that color also . Recd it sooner than expected A++++	1
My son loves the phone. Has had no problems and loves all the features. He says it&apos;s like having a computer in your pocket!	1
My son ordered this phone on may 19th &amp; it is now the 28th. It was supposed to be priority 2 day shipping through usps. A tracking number was provided but there still no shipping info. I&apos;ve tried contacting the seller a few days ago but I nor my son has yet to hear anything from the seller. Not a very happy customer.	0
"My son took the battery out and put it back in to turn on and then it went to the white screen ""Blu bold like Us"" and wont go no where else!"	0

"My wife and I have owned the Breeze II, III, and now IV.  Perfect phone for one who doesn't want/need a smartphone.  Call quality and battery life very good.  Normal useful features.  The IV is a little larger, with a larger screen (which is welcome).  Still fits very comfortably in my pocket.  AT&T stopped doing business with Pantech, so I needed to go to eBay to find two IVs to purchase for me and my wife.  I hope a product like the Breeze IV will always be available to folks like us."	1
My wife has a 6 year old Samsung still working like new so after having several other brands with issues I decided to try one.  This Convoy does everything well and even better than I imagined.  The speaker phone is so clear it is not necessary to have hands free device in the car and every function works perfectly.  The battery life is extreeeeeeeeemely long.	1
My wife is happy with this phone. Being older she didn't want to learn anything new. EXCELLENT condition 	1
"My wife lost my LG 6000 which I had for several years.I&apos;d bought my son a 6100, a year ago,and figured it was time to upgrade mine.Mainly, this model has the Mobile Office Kit,which allows you,like I had for my 6000, to connect phone to laptop to get the internet off of your AIR TIME MINUTES with NO extra charge.  Verizon and the other phone companies typically charge by the Kbyte,on what they usually refer to as &quot;data packages&quot; which adds up very fast.Since I feel cheated that I&apos;m already paying an exhorbitant fee for my phone just to use it, why ALSO get nailed on a data charge?The MOK is fantastic,and basically does what putting a modem on a phone line at your house does.So the MOK is the way to go.      Its not blazing fast,but hey,it is fast enough that there is essentially no lag time on surfing,and it gets me what I need online. I&apos;m a catastrophic adjuster, and spend many hours on the road in areas where there is NO internet connectivity in hotels,restaurants,etc,and this allows me to handle my claims for my clients when there is no other connection, as well as stay in touch with my family when I&apos;m away, by email.I can use it ANYWHERE I have a cell phone signal(my car)and again,its FREE because its off my airtime minutes.Guess what?After 9pm,its completely free,just like my minutes.I&apos;m sure this is why Vrzn and all the other companies started charging &quot;data&quot; rates.  They see another sector they can stream money off the public.  That&apos;s show biz...      I realize that if you need broadband speed, there&apos;s the options of using the pcmcia cards with the little antennas, but again, this is essentially a free modem line off your phone using your laptop.  And unless you are living in the handful of major cities, they don&apos;t tell you about that you dont GET the high speed broadband off those cards they are capable of.  So again, the MOK is for all intent and purposes a great alternative.       Ok, thats MY reason for getting the 6100.  There are sexier, sleeker phones out there, but guess what?  Who cares!!  This is a terrific phone, it WORKS well in areas that normally have crappy service, and my dropouts are minimal. This is of course due to whoever you use for a carrier, and every state has better or worse coverage. In WA, I get 1-3 bars, outside WA, all over U.S. I get 6 bars! I&apos;d love to find the perfect cell phone/carrier, but from everyone I&apos;ve talked to, no one is happy with their service ever, it seems.  So its hit or miss.  Back to the phone.  Its got a lot of good features, all more in quantity than my 6000 had; more picture storage, has a flash, 6000 doesn&apos;t, speaker phone (absolutely essential for driving), voice activatated dialing and recognition (very cool), and simpler to use than the 6000, all in all, a very nice upgrade.I&apos;ve checked to see if the MOK is available for the upper end models, but I haven&apos;t found it, at least the FREE air time kit, I believe verizon makes it for other phones, but you PAY for the service on top of airtime.  It does NOT have bluetooth, so if thats a necessity for you, this is not the phone. (I don&apos;t know if there&apos;s any addons to this phone that give you bluetooth, probably not.)I think the next model up is the 8100 or 8300 and has bluetooth,but check the phone site to be sure.  My next upgrade when my contract runs out will probably be to a Treo or something like that, that will give me all this stuff in one place instead of having to use a laptop.  Hope this helps!-Jim    Update to this review next..."	1
My wife loves it	1
"My wife loves it. I really makes an impact when  people see the white version of the Iphone 4. There is not much else to say, but buy one and enjoy."	1
My wife love's this Blackberry PRIV due to the physical keyboard.  Her original had a loose charging port and Verizon/Asurion doesn't carry them anymore.  We were pleased to find this brand new one on eBay that was packaged well and promptly shipped by airmail.  It works great thanks!!	1
My wife only had this phone for two days then she lost it and we had to buy another one	1
"My wife wanted a phone like mine, but not in the dull grey. I found it in girly pink and she just had to have it. She loves it. The seller provided free shipping and easy to follow instructions on how to activate the phone--took ~10 minutes start to finish.  Phone was in great shape with brand new accessories.  This phone is probably the last of it&apos;s kind--a phone with great features that was built durable with the intent to last for more than a year like most phones."	1
"My wife's G3 burned up, and she didn't want to learn a new phone.  The G4 is perfect.  Improvements that work seamlessly.  Very affordable price, hundreds less than buying from Verizon.  "	1

This fitted the bill perfectly - ok, it&apos;s not a top of the range 3g phone, but if you&apos;re just looking for a phone you can use easily this is the one - just one instance being that the sound is excellent.  As it happens the camera is pretty good too!  I haven&apos;t got round to using all of the features it offers yet, but I expect they&apos;ll be up to the mark and user friendly just as the other functions are.    PS - might be standard to you, and on clamshell phones generally, but I love the fact that it locks and unlocks the keypad on closing and opening the clamshell, saved me a lot of &apos;accidents&apos; and credit on pay as you go."	1

"Negative review, Negative evaluation. The seller deceived me.  Before buying the item I asked the seller if the new item was - the answer was positive. The seller sent not a new damaged phone. The phone has traces of damage and traces of a fall.  The phone has traces of bumps and falls from different sides. In the lower side, where there is damage, the touch panel does not work well. The aluminum frame has traces of bumps and falls. The charger and the USB cable are not new. On the phone there are signs of an autopsy. There is dirt under the lid. The seller  demanded a refund of money bypassing the ebay auction.  The seller wrote me on November 10, 2017:  Take your feedback back. Made it positive. And you can keep the money and the phone. Tell me what you thinking about.... Since you remove the negative feedback and put me +, I will stop the prosecution and I will   close the case. How this look to you?  The seller acknowledged his guilt with his actions.  The seller wrote me that the eBay Customer Service remove negative feedback from him, which I   left. I do not agree with this.  Negative feedback is correct. In his last letter the seller showed disrespect to me. I am very unhappy with this deal! Mike."	0

"New in box, nice little basic phone. Just as they stated it would be!!!  Super fast shipping. I truly like dealing with this seller. Thank you so much!!    It what I stated here. But Im adding to my review. This phone, people have a hard time hearing me  and I hear loud feedback to whom ever Im talking to.   Talked to Verizon and they said it could be because its an older style  phone. Which wont be useful in about a year. Due to them taking out 3G.  This phone was looked up and states 4G but its not.  That was confirmed through Verizon.   Its a 3G phone.  "	0

"Nice smartphone, I like this. OS very fast. about the seller good comunication :), fast shipping. thanks"	1
"Nice strong frame. Limited Edition All black looks dope paired with a Stilgult vertical leather ultraslim. The keyboard works flawlessly. Touch sensitivity is on point. Once you get the hang of it you'll be swiping sentences somewhere between a nanosecond and a second. The camera takes good pictures. Blackberry Hub is great, not quite BB10 but works efficiently. I had to finally give up my Passport Silver. Admittedly, I've owned probably 10 BB devices since 2007. I'll just say this phone is not my Passport, but it's good enough to be my prime 2 line device for the foreseeable future. KeyThree maybe ."	1

"No USB support other than it charges using the typical MICRO-usb port.  Samsung shows there are two models of this phone for Verizon: SCH-U360MAAVZW &amp; SCH-U360MASVZW.  There is a difference of about 2MB in filesize for the two versions of the user manual via Samsung, but good luck finding which model you have from the MEID HEX label inside the phone.  I had to assume I have the SCH-U360MAAVZW because the other is 404 on Verizon.  The back cover is extremely difficult to get off (tracking down which model I had so i could discover that USB drivers are nowhere to be found for this phone).  Push and hold the number 1 key for voicemail is a great feature.  The flimsy case I got with the phone is aweful; both volume controls on the left side, as well as the camera and mute buttons on the right side are blocked, but the USB port is accessible.  Bluetooth transfers are attainable if you wish to send files off the SCH-U360, but I could not get any transfers going from a smartphone (all APP-ed up) or through a D-Link bluetooth adapter."	0

Nokia 6103 was probably one of the worst phones that I have ever had number one and for most was I ordered it off and eBay from China market said the phone was brand-new when I got the phone it had no characteristics of being new at all it took 20 days to get the phone phone with statically would not die all numbers and now even with eBay trying to help get the money back two months later no money.	0

Nokia N900 has to be one of the best cell phones ever.  I bought one of these over ebay a few years ago the bad part was i ended up buying it and the keypad on the phone was a french model.    My advice to anyone buying these over ebay is contact the seller before buying it! Make sure it has a US or a keypad in your language mostly i&apos;ve only seen US versions on ebay but some sellers are selling models that are french so becareful!    Phone is very unique compared to some phones.  I use my phone for pentesting out in the field their is a public firmware called &quot;Pwnie Express&quot; which will gives you some stuff that Backtrack Linux has metasploit wireless carding software ect lots of goodies!    I believe you can get a SIM card for this phone from Metro PCS or you can it the SIM card from AT&amp;T or Sprint.  Can&apos;t think of anything else to say.	1

none of the usual adafruit drivers/libraries seem to work.  Zero documentation in the description on what libraries identifier will work for it.  I bought one from amazon came with a cd absolutely no problems	0

"Not a bad iPhone.  Beats buying a new one, plus I like the iPhone 5 form factor.  Powered up and transferred devices seamlessly, thank you Apple and Sprint.    I have learned to live with an intermittent, where it loses power and reboots.  Acts like a bad pc board connection.  Will probably have it looked at or the battery replaced down the road if the intermittent gets any worse.  Especially if they keep swapping out phones taken in for a simple battery replacement."	0

Not a high option phone but works well. I bought this for my g/f who doesn&apos;t have much technical know how but she seems to use it with no problems.	1
"Not a pleasant transaction. We cancelled the order eventually.   Here is what happened. We placed the order with premium for expedited shipping. We sent an separate email to the seller saying we are in a hurry to get the phone and pls help to ship the phone asap.   We got notified the next day 'the item is shipped'. Great, i was so impressed by their turn-around time. But guess what? All they did is just creating a shipping label!!  4 days went by, the seller still hasn't given the carrier the item. When we called and emailed the seller a number of times asking what's going on. No response.   We ended up going to local apple store to buy the phone for my inlaws as we are running out of time.   I am very disappointed with their lack of response and failure to live up to their shipping delivery promise as advertised. "	0
Not a smartphone (but not too dumb either). I needed this because I wanted something nice that didn&apos;t require a data plan to use. This fits the bill perfectly.	1
"not a very good product, not very happy at all with it!!!

Not as described or in shape like described. Paid extra money for faster delivery but it was a rip off. Be careful! 	0

Not as new like seller say . Too much scratch and ding look like b- refurnish phone	0
"Not bad for a backup phone. quite handy.battery is fine, screen resolution is good. but it needs BB data plan to function or you need to have third party apps to use wifi"	1
"Not bad phone (phone, instead of the smart phone). It is simple in circulation. Truth is defects. The quite good display. The weak processor-brakes at reproduction of video of files. The bad complete set instead of necessary  maintenance for the computer in a complete set lies from Windows Mobile (this phone has operating system Brew created on platform Linux, therefore for it there are no programs as a way out - Jawa appendices), operating instructions from other phone. The native browser incorrectly works, it is possible to establish Opera mini, but will work more slowly. There are also other lacks, there are also advantages, but at my phone in a week of use was gone sound."	0
not buy items from this seller is a scammer	0
NOT COMPATIBLE WITH AT&T. I went to AT&T to see if I could get the phone activated and they said that new SIM cards that they make do not fit in the slot of this phone and other older phones.	0
Not even 3 months and the phone is toast.  Been in a case since we received it and the screen is black.  Tried soft and hard reset and nothing is working. 	0
"Not even a month and I am going to return it. Speaker phone is not very loud, when you switch to using the phone it hangs up. Going to return it. Not worth the money. Best Buy refused my return, and ebay wound not help because the seller refused the return. I couldn't even go to Best Buy and exchange it. Won't shop at Best Buy ever again"	0
Not for everyone. I got mine from ebay. Overall I would say this is a decent smartphone/gps unit.     Would I recommend it? Yeah sure but personally I wouldn&amp;amp;apos;t buy this now at it&amp;amp;apos;s current going rate. 50 bucks tops.    [Update] Battery life is atrocious! The only saving grace is I own a garmin gps and this phone uses the same car charger.    [Update] Screen no longer works.	0

"Not having owned any other &quot;smart&quot; (or at least not developmentally disabled) phones, I have to make the disclaimer that I&apos;m not the most well-informed bloke on this matter. I&apos;ve been told this phone is the gateway drug to the iPhone, and I have to say I do look forward to having one of those, since I&apos;m yoked to AT&amp;T for approximately forever and the Droid thus escapes my reach.    As for the LG I do like the full touch-screen keyboard and the multiplicity of punctuation marks &amp; other symbols. As an actual telephone, it seems to work okay.  Who can tell if the dropped calls are more the phone&apos;s or the network&apos;s fault?  I didn&apos;t opt for a data plan (saving as I am my virginity for the above-mentioned iPhone), but that doesn&apos;t keep the phone from being all bored just sitting in the dark in my pants pocket and spontaneously taking me online and running up extra charges. I could just lock out the &quot;data&quot; option, but then you see I wouldn&apos;t be able to send or receive photos with my texts.  Who can live like that?   A tech support guy took me through the 3-step process to lock the phone to avoid spontaneous online forays and sudden trips to the TV shows that I could if I wanted to shell out more for.  But three steps?  Really?  Don&apos;t they know who they&apos;re dealing with?    But there&apos;s something else you should know.  I bought me a Pioneer car stereo from my LOCAL INDEPENDENT dealer--NOT a corporate big box place, thank you very much.  I opted for hands-free Bluetooth so I could comply with Cal. state law when I talk on my LG phone.  It worked okay for a short spell, then intermittently, and finally not at all.  So I went back to see the car stereo guy Al--HIM I would recommend, no sweat.  And he spent an HOUR-AND-A-HALF trying to sync up the LG to the Bluetooth--no dice.  He talked to the secret tech support guy for dealers from Bluetooth--you know, kind of like when a doctor talks to the radiologist. And you know what he found out?  That the LG can&apos;t really support Bluetooth on the Pioneer car stereo!  Which means I paid a bunch extra for Bluetooth capacity on the stereo and I can&apos;t use it!  Thanks a lot, LG"	0
"Not impressed at all with this smart phone.  The touch screen does not function well, it is cumbersome to get to texting mode, the e-mail set up is not very user friendly.  I thought this would be much nicer, oh well.  It works and I will make do for now."	0
"Not JD but a review anyway, had the 3s then the 4s & now got the iPhone 5s, I cannot fault these phones other than to say only three things I would change that I think would make them better and they would be: 1. Add a memory card slot 2. Built in wi wifi battery charging and 3. Solar power charging  (Possibly using the back of the phone as a solar panel)"	1

"Not Motorola best effort at all. The phone has alot of problems, display is not going to hold up, flip part will break if you look at it, good luck on getting it to charge, and the cut down battery Motorola came up with for this model is junk!!!!!sound is better if you just lay the phone down and yell at whoever your trying to call, get use to seeing the NO SERVICE screen. this is not based on one phone, we refurbish phones for years now, this is based on the 1000&apos;s we got of this model T720-T730 CDMA and GSM models. Save your money, buy something better. You want a cheap phone buy a Motorola V60 or a Nokia, buy something that works, this model has more problems than I can count."	0

"Not the phone I was looking for for my husband, does not have the features his last phone had"	0
"Not the sellers fault at all. Phone was brand new & unlocked just like advertised.  But I hate this phone.  Too convoluted for picture storage. Very difficult to put pictures in folders, and then to find them when they are. No flash. Indoor pictures are dark.  Contact list will not open without going thru at&t address book. In other words, contact list will not immediately open up.  WILL NOT SEND NOR RECEIVE pictures thru text messaging, (MMS).  Battery life is not that good.  No comment on data plans. I got phone just for talk, text, & picture taking.  I reckon that is why it is only a $40 phone.  "	0

"ok it don&apos;t work well with my network and it doesn&apos;t work with my computer, I tried to register it online but could not find the webpage. I also could not put music on there. So this phone is not for me. It works on phone calls and text messaging but it is hard to handle it because I have to jump through hoops to get it to work. But I am keeping it for my back up phone in case my other one I got gives out or gets lost."	0
Ok phone but didn't work out the box.. Had to purchase new one from Best Buy.. Kind of tricky to play music..	0
"Ok the title was click bait but you need to hear this. BUY THIS PHONE NOW  Cons: the charger I got was broken when I got it (the cord was fine but plug part was wonky, like I would plug it to the wall and it would turn my phone screen on and off, luckily I just used my HTC plug and it worked perfectly fine)  It didn't come with the thing you need to open the Sims card so I just used a needle and it popped out perfectly.  Pros is EVERYTHING, the shipping was perfect and fast, I ordered it on a Friday and it came that Tuesday, the Package was packed securely, so secure that it took me forever to open it, the phone is basically in mint condition. "	1
"ok, be honest, this phone is a dissapointing. its a refurnished phone, however, the phone its self still has the previous owner&apos;s contact numbers. and, there is networking problem with this phone. after i get a replacement from the buyer(takes 2 weeks to get thing done:(  ), the new one seems fine. however its not! the paint of the phone start to fade,,and theres problem with the mic...others hardly can hear my voice. i spend like 70 dollars for this one but what do i get? btw, the battery comes with it is not OEM and it sux...i need to recharge it EVERYDAY. and the phone manual is rediculus. the cover is t39m while the inside content is a t10! what can i say?"	0
"Ok, here we go, here&apos;s the quote from the description: &quot;A key distinctive design element in the Nokia 8910 is its attractive titanium casing.&quot;  It&apos;s not metal, it&apos;s plastic!   I&apos;m so disappointed! If I could change my feedback, I would leave a negative one!  Anyway, the key feature of this phone for me was it&apos;s housing msde of metal!. I can buy 1202 not the 8910 to get a cheap s**tty phone!    European charger plug is only an extender, charger is not original, cheap chinese s**t!      I&apos;m VERY disappointed! But got what I paid for, I think."	0
"Ok. I had this phone on Verizon for the first phone (V325i) and it was excellent. Every feature worked great. So when I got a silver version of this phone from a family member I believe it was the v323xi? But it had horrible battery for the second phone, couldn;t send or recieve pictures and almost all of the time I got a message back saying that My message had been delivered. I was so happy to switch back to my Jest phone. At first this runs great/but getting it again is a big no no. But it is a very durable phone. For that I think it deserves SOME credit"	0
"Ok. This was my first time ordering anything off of EBay. In the description of this phone the  seller stated the camera didn't work and the phone had scratches(in the pictures that were posted) so AFTER I made the purchase the seller told me ""Also, you do know that the phone is financed and it can't work under Sprint""  Well how am I supposed to know that if it was NOT in the description?!?!!! This seller has not been responding back to any of my messages and I'm extremely upset about it!!! I thought this was a good seller because the reviews were good BUT my experience was TERRIBLE!!! Did a claim with my bank and still awaiting on a response from the seller. VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!"	0

"Older phone, However I do not like contracts so this was a great buy since it is a quad core 2gb of ram with 32gb of storage, The camera doesn&apos;t blow you away but I paid only $180 new so who can complain!I would recommend this device over models such as the Moto X xt1060 simply because the Moto X is only a dual core device and having owned it I can tell you the speaker quality isn&apos;t that great and even thought the camera is 10MB I found it to be the same quality as the HTC One M7. Also of note is that this device is light, like I forget it is there. Probably a good idea to buy a UAG case to go with it as they are prone to display damage."	1
Omg I got a iPhone 7 plus today it's so good and very much fast plus has very fast service	1

"on 1/6/2015 I spoke with Sony at CES Show. Bottom Line: They are aware that numerous seller are offering counterfeit Sony Z2 and other model smartphones. These may have once been new Sony phones but have been repaired and modified by people who don't know what they're doing. End result is a phone that falls apart (back fell of, magnetic charger didn't work, entire phone died within 2 days. The counterfeit boxes are larger than a real Sony Box. That's clue #1. Then you compare the serial # inside in the phone settings to one on the box. If they are not identical, you have a counterfeit. "	0
On delivery of this mobile phone I could not get into it as it was &quot;PAssword Protected&quot; I emailed the seller &amp; he sent me 3 codes to try. None of these opened my phone &amp; now have purchased a completly useless mobile !!!!!!! Still to this day he has not got back to me &amp; got this mess sorted. Keep well away from him in future. :(	1
"On July 14, 2010 I purchased 2 razr Motorolla&quot;unlocked&quot; AT&amp;T phones from Sell-Cellphone of China. It took about 2 weeks to receive the phones and by then we were really excited about our new purchase. Unfortunately even after spending about 3 or 4 hours on the phone with AT&amp;T tech folks and a couple of store visits we never could get the phones to update the time, send or receive email or pictures, download ring tones, etc. One of the phone failed right away and the only way to hear with it was to use the speakerphone. The phone were returned and it has now been a little over 2 weeks since we mailed them back and we still have not received the full refund we were promised."	0
"On receiving the phone, I charged it, but it would not power up. I took it to a Blackberry repairer who advised me that the phone was a refurbished phone and that it had a lot of issues. I had to pay an additional $56 to get the phone repaired. I bought the phone as a NEW phone not a refurbished phone, therefore, I am very disappointed in the purchase. I would be very reluctant to make any further purchases from ebay."	0
"On the description it says unlock, it was locked to at&amp;t. No memory card and the battery damage. Bad item"	0
On this phone the microphone and Camera doesn't work. I checked on the internet and a lot of people have the same problem. It isn't good to sell an Item like this. I can't return it because it got shipped to Mexico where I'm at the time.	0

"On you questions above, I don't know if it has a long battery life, as I haven't move my service over yet, and I don't know what a small form factor is, but I ordered this phone, used, and it looks brand new!  Not only that, it said it was to arrive the 27th, and it arrived on the 24th.  :)  I can't wait to move my service over and see if it works as good as the service has been.  Thanks again!"	1
"Once I had some issue here and the seller solved it in 24hrs. Good communication and kind enough to solve issue. Nice guy, and good job. "	1
Once you get it programed it works great. Very happy I purchased this phone.	1

"One of the best no nonsense cell phones period. Not tons of gizmos that you DO NOT NEED REALLY and that drain your battery faster than you can imagine.

One of the bests android phones ever!	1
"One of the only Virgin Mobile Phones that can still be used for both Paylo and Beyond Talk Plans maximizing your plan flexibility. Just a cool, vintage Virgin Mobile phone that gets me all misty eyed thinking about the good &apos;ole days when phones were merely for talk and text. You can install Opera Mini and Google Maps thus increasing the usability of the phone like if you need directions or need to access your email or to look up something on the internet. I love the fact that it can get on the internet and is so tiny and cute w/ the slider feature that it hides easily in one&apos;s pocket. I love it. The only issues are the calculator only goes to the hundredths decimal place (Mantra goes to the ten thousandths), there is no zoom on the camera (Mantra has a post picture zoom feature) and sometimes the texting can be a little cumbersome when using the space key b/c you have to press it twice to get it to space once (Mantra space key only needs to be pressed once per space), but the phone looks so cool, and the slider feature is so slick and awesome that that in itself makes up for the aforementioned lagging features. I just kinda wish it had the exact features that the Manta has. The Mantra I feel is a better made phone because it&apos;s made in Korea whereas the Slash is made in China (both by Samsung), but I love them both. The Mantra I feel also has a brighter screen and it is a little larger. I actually have both phones and just swap them whenever I feel like changing it up a little bit. Sometimes I want to use the flip, other times the slider. I love the Slash though. Still a very relevant and cool phone for Virgin Mobile. I wish they still sold them. This and the Mantra are the coolest phones on the market even today, but I&apos;m a minimalist with whom these phones fall in line wih my paradigm that phones are primarily for talk/text with some light internet access and other features like camera and bluetooth. It has everything I need. I just wish I was able to download more ringtones and wallpaper since I refuse to purchase them. Both Slash and Mantra have only a very few stock ringtones, wallpapers etc so I just take pictures and set them as my wallpaper, but as far as the ringtones go, they are cool, but so few of them so you&apos;re pretty much stuck w/ stock as I haven&apos;t figured out a way to download free ringtones as it blocks those sites that I&apos;ve tried. It seems like you&apos;d have to pay for the ringtones and wallpapers directly from Virgin Mobile, and that I don&apos;t like. But, like I said, I won&apos;t pay for them anyway, and I can live w/ the stock stuff so it&apos;s all good.  Great, cool-looking, easy to carry, hide and use phone. Great job Samsung. They just don&apos;t make &apos;em like this anymore like many great things, but cell phones are just way too involved these days. This phone has everything I could ever want in a CELL PHONE."	1
"One of the stereo speakers isn't  functioning, for it showed signs of being dropped. I'm sure it isn't the fault of the seller though. Other than that, it's a great device and it works.  (Edit: Turns out the ""speaker"" is actually a mic, research helps! Please disregard the complaint above.) "	1
"One of the worst decisions I've ever made.  $176 terribly spent. Att has proprietary phone numbers you can't remove from your phone list.  Forget about texting unless you're in a rest home and have all the time in the world.  Volume doesn't turn up high enough.  etc., etc., etc."	0
"One problem I had... the case for it interferes with the ear phone plug. I had to cut part out of the case in order to plug in the head phone plug. This port allows me to connect to my car stereo as well as a boombox that I use at my market booth. So that is not a knock on the iPhone, but a knock on the case makers. Sometimes I feel the apps and th e new new new iOS sucks... its not a Jobs iOS. not intuitive. Some things did not need fixing... and now I am lost in trying to get them to work. The volume of my iTunes are much lower... not use why. The volume limit is not on. I have to crank up the volume in the car and boombox. I can't find how to play the videos that used to easy to find and do. Installing Apps are mow a painful experience.... you did not need to fix it.. .Oh.. and two step verification is too quick... I need to have that window open longer. or why not have it open when I am typing it in... Hey I am 70 and still use my Amiga 2000..."	1
one was the phone was a very good price .two is the plan on the phone is cheap.  i really recommend this phone to people is very handie and fix right in ur pocket.Also the feature on the phone are good.	1
"One week after I got the phone, I rated it 3 out of 5 stars. The next week, I lowered it to 2 stars. Here's the old review: ""Overall it's okay. Was sluggish and would freeze up starting from day 2. I've had it for a little over a week now, and apps like Instagram or Snapchat often crash or get incredibly slow. Camera is very laggy. Overall though, it gets the job done just fine for a decent price.  Reviewed last night and gave the product 3/5 stars. Then the charger stopped working just now, so I'm reducing the rating. I've had the phone about a week and a half.""  -----------------UPDATED  REVIEW----------------- I've now had this phone for about 2 months and it's just died on me. It won't turn on. It's also been very sluggish before it died. Please do not buy from this seller, even if you're looking to save money on a cheap and simple phone. I wasn't looking for anything fancy, just something that would work at a low cost. Clearly was a mistake."	0
"One works just fine a bit sluggish, the other one turns off randomly or even worse the screen freezes and I have to let the phone die out. ""New"" phones shouldn't act like this, very disapointed, should consider testing the phones before throwing any phone into the customer package and this happen to me on a different phone I bought on eBay I guess it very common. TEST YOUR PHONES BEFORE SHIPPING TO CUSTOMER!!!! Avoid ""phonestoreusa"" until they describe their phones as 100% tested."	0
"One would think that the seller would have placed Delivery Confirmation on an item that cost over $100. I have wasted my time and MONEY! The USPS is one of the worst ways to have a package delivered. Not only did this seller use USPS, they didn&apos;t get Delivery Conformation. Thanks A Lot!!!"	0
"Only a half phone, without back ,wire and plug user manual.Dont need that. Money back at once.Need a phone. Dont send me more.You hawe to take cost of transport back.I need to by phone from other place.Gear Best is a good place to shop. How can you do this.Nothing to escuse.They new this."	0

only lasted one week the charging port is broken the operating system is crap the screen scratches easily  honestly nokia should stop making phones they have no idea in what they are doing  I will never use another nokia ever  I wouldn't have one even if I was given one for free	0
only one thing I don&apos;t like...the apps (for my IP Camera&apos;s) at the windows store just don&apos;t compare to the Android market....that&apos;s disappointing because I really love the phone.  there is a slight learning curve but the phone has a lovely running system. Love the display screen and the different colors you can set it to.  It doesn&apos;t let me copy and paste from one email client to another (just couldn&apos;t figure it out). It&apos;s a very nice phone though.	1

"only use the phone for the direct connect feature.  but overall the phone is a good phone, battery lasts, and it does the job :)"	1

Ordered refurbished iPhone 7 and got an iPhone 6 in an iPhone 7 box. Seller did not respond to return request. Had to open a case for product return.	0
"Ordered the iphone February 1st 2016 and on February 2nd 2016 I found out that I got a bogus tracking number. Messaged him and never got a response. I had to open up a claim to get my money back. He also gave a phony phone number to eBay. I called him he hangs up, I call back number has been changed or disconnected. This guy is a fraud and tried to keep my money without giving me my iPhone. That's fine though because after my refund processes I'll be going elsewhere. BUYER'S BEWARE!"	0

"Ordered this phone, arrived quickly and works perfectly. Success! "	1
ordered what was supposed to be a new gleam. You could not hear me talking when I received a call. battery only lasted about 6 to 8 hours before dying without being used. They sent me another phone of the same kind. This one had no service 90% of the time. Even very close to a tower when other phones had full service. Sent both back and received a refund. Would not buy another one.	0
"Orginal phone was sent  in good conditon, but did not have a ESN so it could not be activated by verizon. Sent phoen back and it was repalced with a phone that would not chage up and was in bad condition not as advertised. Did not send back a third time due to price of shipping. Phone was far rom what was advertised. very disapoonted"	0
"Other phones I&apos;ve owned have simpler menus and get you to important features easily. Overall, I&apos;d recommend the phone if you&apos;re on a budget."	1

"Our family had two x426 phones for about a year, and we loved them.      The first things we admired about them was their compact, clean style and solid feel.  Their beautiful color display and clear reception were a welcome bonus.      All that&apos;s very nice, but what we really wanted to know was -- do they work?    We found the x426 phones to be very reliable with excellent battery life.  The buttons are easy to use, and the menus are simple to navigate.  The phones are well designed, small enough to fit in your pocket, and look great.  The displays are bright and colorful, and the sound quality is excellent -- we never had any reception problems whatsoever.      We loved that the x426 phones are completely customizable.  We uploaded our own wallpapers, set secure passwords, and assigned ring tones to specific numbers and/or groups.  The programmable directional pad came in handy for instantly accessing the calendar, alarm, call records, and calculator (just about any function can be programmed here).  I used the alarm to alert me for eBay auctions quite a bit, and the To Do List became invaluable to me.  **There are many other features, too many to describe here, but the 500 name phone book, call waiting, caller ID, and alerts (sound and vibrate) worked flawlessly and are all worth mentioning.    The manual is clearly written, nicely cross-referenced, and it&apos;s a nice, small size that will tuck away in the smallest drawer.  The AC adapters are also small enough to store easily, and they completely charge fully depleted batteries in about an hour.  Battery life for these phones is exceptional.  The batteries still held the same strong charge as when new, and, in our case, the batteries lasted 2-3 days without a charge.    Our single, very minor complaint was the ridiculously small rubber protectors for the phones&apos; AC adapter connections, sort of tiny plugs at the foot of the phones.  These silly things are about 1/8&quot; W x 1/2&quot; L, and, unless you have ESP, you&apos;ll lose them straight away.  Wrestling the protectors in and out every time we needed to charge the phones was annoying, so we stored the plugs and used the phones without them.    Of note, the x426 is preloaded with some questionable ring tones, but downloading ring tones of your choice quickly resolves this.  The wallpapers are animated, and most are acceptable.  However, personalized wallpapers are easily uploaded to the x426 with a Samsung Serial Data Cable.  Software for creating wallpapers is a free download from Samsung (as of this writing).    The x426 phone is an excellent choice for teens or first time cell phone users because it&apos;s so simple to use.  If there&apos;s ever a question, the User Guide is very understandable and quick to reference.  Further, the phone&apos;s many features are easily accessed and can be personalized to the user.  And, many organizations, like secure workplaces, do not allow cell phones with cameras, and these phones meet that requirement.    Overall, we were very pleased with the performance of the x426 phones and the accessories.  We had no problems at all.      In fact, the x426 phones impressed us so much that when we signed a new service contract, we opted for the x427m phones -- the x426 twins.  You just can&apos;t go wrong with a full-featured phone that&apos;s stylish, dependable, and simple to use.      **We didn&apos;t use the WAP 2.0 Web Browser (mMode), but this internet option is available (text messaging, etc.).  Java games are preloaded, but we only explored these once or twice."	1

"Outstanding condition, fast delivery, even though it did not come with an OEM charger the 3rd party charger was very good with capability to charge 2 devices at the same time."	1
Outstanding product.  Even though it was pre-owned it looks brand new and has a larger screen then the original Droid Maxx. 	1
"Outstandingly good! Very user friendly.  Works great! Siri is wonderful, size is great, sound quality is good and has an awesome camera."	1
Over all this is a good phone and it have plenty of space.	1

Overall excellent experience!  A great value.  Product was received quickly and in perfect condition.	1
Overall Good Phone Like The Camera and texting. but the touch is too sensitive. but its OK.. really liking this phone	1
Overall I know its a good phone its just that when I received the phone it didn't work. It kept freezing up on the start up screen..	0
overall it was good.	1
"Overall the functions of the phone are as stated, good.  The crack in the armor is that the battery life is poor.  It appears that the battery is in the early stages of needing replacement. I feel that the battery should have been replaced prior to  sale.  The two (2) star rating is being a bit generous in this case.A.D"	0
Overall the physical look of the phone is really good but it has the WORST burn in. I can tell that whoever had this phone last left it open on Snapchat a lot from how bad the burn in is.	0
"Overall, a good model! Batareja ensure sufficient capacity in the standby mode, the video and audio mode, lacking some of its strength! Games and radio active labi.Mnuss, quite often take a screen calibration. Problem is the back cover seems to be a little bit loose.  I bought, because this model provides a good relationship between price and capabilities.    Sincerely,  Juris Tarvds"	1
Overheating and poor battery life maybe im not lucky but i got this phone with defects.	0
"Owned this phone for several months (before I knew any better). Only good thing about it is the battery life and service coverage.  However, even for the price of just the phone, it&apos;s not a good bargain...but for the price of service, it&apos;s just a blatant rip-off. (I tried moving to Straight Talk&apos;s BYOP plan with this phone, but data wouldn&apos;t work due to a lock by Verizon).     There&apos;s no querty keyboard, no music player, horrible internet, micro screen and even simple 2D games would barely work (btw, verizon charges $10 per game on non-android phones), etc.    Some decent Android phones are selling for $20 these days.  Even at that price, the specs are light years better...and the games are free."	0
"Package arrived fast with no problems and delays. I experienced some problems setting up the phone, but the seller helped me with all the process. I'll definitely make business with him again."	1
Package is as expected.	1
"Pagamos por un iPhone 7 plus de 32gb y nos enviaron un iPhone 6 de 32 gb daado, no funcionaba. Al reclamar me pidieron que enviara el celular de regreso, pero el celular ya est el centro Amrica porque era un regalo y regresarlo era imposible. Lo ms lgico era que me cobrarn por un iPhone 6 y me regresarn la diferencia y aunque se los solicite muchas veces no les di la gana. Por empresas como estas es que la gente no confa en comprar por internet."	0

"Paid more to get a t-mobile phone only to receive the verizon anyway. I thought ""open box"" meant it was new with everything except the tape holding the box closed. I hope this isn't a bait and switch scam So far I am unsatisfied with my attempted purchase 1 star only because it won't let me do no stars"	0
Palm Treo 700wx of Telus is a smartphone which fontionne under Windows Mobile 5. It is expensive qand same but can be very interesting for somebody who absolutely want Palm with the Mobile advantage of Microsoft Windows 5.  Are screen is very interesting and Palm Treo 700wx is a very solid apparatus. The keyboard is also very well concu. Bleutooth connection is also present what makes it possible to use an ear-phone without wire. The Operating system is also an advantage since Wndows Mobile 5 offer several options very interesting.  Are price is nevertheless to raise considering the absance WiFi connection. Are poid is enough to raise what can quickly become awkward.	1
"Pantech clearly needs a little more development time before they are ready to market a phone with the purported capabilities of the Pantech C150.      The first problem is the little joystick button centered under the screen.  You have to scroll it up, down, right, or left to scroll through the menus.  If you push it straight down in the process, you&apos;ve connected to the internet.  (ka-ching!)  You can&apos;t reprogram the buttons.  It&apos;s also a fragile little button, meant only for delicate fingers.    Problem two surfaces when you receive a call.  You can&apos;t hear most of the ring-tones if you have the phone in a pouch, pocket, or purse.  You can set the phone to ring and vibrate at the same time, which helps, but, for the most part,  you&apos;d better have the phone pasted to your body and make everyone around you is quiet just in case you get a call.    The third problem that we found irritating is the battery life.  On the most minimal settings, we got about 8 hours of standby time before the phone needed to be charged.  If you used the phone to talk, that time decreased.  If you used bluetooth, it lagged in transfer and sucked the life out of the Pantech C150.    The keypad lock did not manage to protect from that joystick button connecting to the internet while in a pouch.  (ka-ching!) The security lock even managed to work itself into entering a PUK code while in a pouch, as well. (ka-ching!)    The quality of the photographs are minimal, although you can set the pixel to two different settings.  The movie mode (look out battery) is not superb, either.    I might have thought, seeing all of the other ratings, that I had a bad phone.  It couldn&apos;t be, however, because we have two of them.  I doubt they were both equally sub-par.    In short, it&apos;s cute.  That was the first thing that attracted me to the Pantech C150.  That&apos;s pretty much all we got."	0

"People can't hear me when I'm in call unless the phone is on speaker phone mode. Considering this phone is pretty much too old to be good for anything other than calls, text messages, and email, this is pretty disappointing. I'm sure this is something that this seller knew about, it's very obvious, but only after it happens a few times after you've already bought it and put cell service on it.   Pretty much a waste of money."	0
People I talk too say they can not hear me 	1
"PEOPLE!!!! Absolute worst phone I have ever owned!! Had it for less than a year and have taken good care of it. The L,M,U,K,(.)and (?) buttons no longer work. So pretty much can no longer text (the main reason I bought the phone). Oh, and when the &apos;k&apos; or &apos;space bar&apos; button is pressed the phone shuts off and I have to put the password back in and go back to the text. Very annoying. This phone is JUNK!! Loved it at first. Then everything slowly started to shut down on it. I would never recommend this phone to anyone!!"	0

"Perfect phone for on the go without wifi. Seller I purchased this from sent me a new in box, international ship was fast to.  Be careful when buying back covers or extended battery cover Not all fit, check the notches on the back of new cover before buying, this phone only has one notch. Also be careful with hard plastic covers, the cheap ones don&apos;t fit,ask seller first.  I use this V3 as a replacement for my White LG chocolate battery life on that&apos;s is bad.    I also us a Moto Defy that I just love when I need wifi."	1

"phone is a phone and a smart computer))). I love this phone. I still like his size. If it do even more for a samsung galaxe note, in general it would be super (5.3)"	1
"Phone is all you can ask for regarding speed, functionality, and latest hardware. Squeeze edge sense is great for picture taking. Camera does exceptionally well in most situations, low light condition pics could be better. Screen is bright, even in sunny conditions. "	1
Phone is as it was advertised. Works great and was at a great value. Even came with a charger. Thank you for a great sale.	1
Phone is bad. Cant do anything on it its so slow alot of things dont work. Bad bad phone i hate it..	0
"Phone is cheap, but could be even cheaper as it is made from bad quality of plastic all af it.  When i received it i had big problems with it&apos;s batteries. The phone turned on but when somebody called me it turned off so i couldn&apos;t use it. I contacted the seller and he told me i should send phone back in order to be fixed. I found out that it was just a battery problem and both batteries they sent me where faulty.  So they shipped me two better batteries and now phone works ok.  Greek menu is very badly translated.  I wouldn&apos;t buy it again, but seller behaved ok and solved my problem even though i had to wait about a month to be able to use it properly."	0
"Phone is damage   -broken glass  (as described by seller )  -there&apos;s a cracked line from broken glass to the top of screen )  -there are a lot of clear hard glue at broken glass and around the handset   -The instructions to unlock the phone which is the proof of the phone isn&apos;t unlocked yet and as a user I never ever and don&apos;t know how to do.   -Two batteries has no power, so I never power on and I put the back in the box to return.   Thanks"	0

"Phone is great! This is my second one. Can&apos;t by this at the ATT store. Too bad LG discontinued. Have not found a new phone with anywhere near the quality of the ear speaker. Crystal clear, does have slight muffled sound like newer models."	1
"Phone is great, it has allot of internal space 1.8GB + 8GB SD card. Battery life is not that great, 1 day with medium use, 8 hours heavy use. 2 days standby or maybe more.    All in all is a great Android phone and probably the best with hardware keyboard.     Only problem I dint research before buying the phone is the 3G support. This phone supports 3G, but only the T-Mobile bands not the AT&amp;T bands even unlocked. There is 2 versions of this phone, one for T-Mobile called G2 and the other called HTC Desire Z. The Desire Z will support ATT 3G bands.      Good luck and happy shopping!"	1
"Phone is great, screen is very vivid. The size of the display could have been a tad bit larger. Phone is very snappy and camera has improved. The battery life of the phone isn&apos;t as great as I was expecting. It lasted me on average about 5-6 hours each day which means I have to carry around the charger."	1
Phone is hard to use.....I have large hands and am constantly pushing at least two buttons at the same time.  It is very slick and I drop it about half the time when I take it out of the holder.  I would not buy another like it.	0
phone is in almost perfect working condition.i did not receive charger.i am still happy because phone is in good working condition.for this price you cant beat it-fortunately my old phone charger works with this fine.only con is its battery drains a little bit faster-then again for this price no complains-i can buy  battery from amazon for $15.delivery was fast too.	1

Phone is perfect!	1
Phone is quick and snappy.  Battery life is better than my S7.  I love it.  What else can I say?	1
"Phone is refurbished with the worst plastic material worth 1 dollar. Worst quality, please stay away. You will regret. The plastic material, the gold plating are of quality that is seen in a 1-10 dollar store. I don't mind losing money here but never expected something to be of the cheapest quality. Will never buy again from the seller and I am selling the phone today at 10 times lesser the value I paid. Shipment is delayed for no reason. I paid for expedited shipping and handling time took 7 days. I will post an ad in the local classified site for a week for least price or will gift away to a needy. Phone doesn't charge."	0
Phone is slow and freezes up constantly. We replaced it with a different phone.	0
"phone is slow, battery life is bad, it turns off even when it's charged and in middle of call."	0
Phone is still on a lease with Sprint. An annoying message pops up every minute stating so. Sprint allowed me to activate it and use it still. I messaged gizmo about it and they gave me $25 for the inconvenience. $340 for a unpaid for leased phone is terrible. People are basically leasing them from sprint then selling them to gizmo. 	0
Phone is super slow and it's like 4 generations behind. Can't use it for anything.	0
Phone is the 2nd HTC m8 I've owned...both started slow to not charging....beautiful phone but not worth the trouble	0
"Phone is too old to be connected to a network.  Should never be offered for sale now.  In its day, it was probably good."	0
"Phone is too small for efficient use. Lots of echoing- feedback-very poor sound. Its possible my phone was defective because so many other people like the model. I however was very disappointed and returned it after one week of frustration. I replaced it with &quot;prism&quot; which is in a similar price range, but in my opinion a significantly superior android for the money."	0
Phone is totally bad and when u charged very hot 	0
Phone is very basic and did not allow me to download any apps (specifically whatsapp) but music. It is only good for a back up phone to talk on. 	0
Phone is very easy to used ans have a good battery.	1
"Phone is very good. Very solidly built, and the camera is incredible. Battery life is huge. With moderate use to heavy use, I can take off charge in the morning and easily go 16 hours and STILL have around 30% battery left. Best of all, the bloatware on his phone is very limited leaving more rooms for apps that I want and use instead of apps I don't want and will never use. Downside is wireless charging is not part of the phone and there's no headphone jack. Have to use Bluetooth or a adapter. Overall, phone is great. Very fast, responsive, and well built. I'd say 4.5 stars. 5 if it had the headphone jack and supported wireless charging. "	1
"Phone is what I expected, being it was from OLD Nokia. Before MS bought it. Screen clear and big, battery good life, and light. "	1

Phone listed Gsm unlocked. But phone only works with TMobile! And seller doesnt reply. Horrible. 	0
Phone looked good physically but AT&T could not get it to work. Even took it to a repair shop and they said there was something wrong and would cost too much to fix if the could fix it. I returned it and did get my money refunded promptly. I would not buy from them again	0
"Phone looked in mint condition, after 3 weeks the screen died. Took it to Apple store to replace the screen which would cost 129. Apple replaced the screen, but the phone would not power up properly & so they offer to replace the phone with a new SE. But I had to trade in my current SE & pay 129. So I traded it and cut my losses, instead of going through the trouble of getting a refund. "	0

"Phone seemed to be overheating, so I returned it. No problem from seller."	0
"Phone seems okay except for the fact that the WiFi doesn't work, even after doing all available system updates and multiple resets. The WiFi connects, but is unusable. It's as if it's in a ""connected, no internet access"" state, except it doesn't say that. It just says connected. Would not recommend this phone."	0
"Phone seems to work just fine....have not activated yet. Good description...thank you!! I bought it as a x-mas gift, great experience!!!!"	1

"Phone turns off by itself, while I'm on the phone or using apps."	0
Phone was a Christmas gift. I tried to charge but display would show Starting but never Charging. I left like that for several hours hoping it would work. I turned phone on and updated software and was able to make a call. I went back to use it again after an hour but it was turned off? I turned it back on but it did the same thing. I emailed company about my issue and Justin told me it could be battery and they would send me one to test. It never came. I emailed them two more times but no response. Phone got misplaced here in the house so now we cannot find it. Tried to call it but I am sure it turned itself off. $90 dollars down the drain.	0
Phone was a locked deviced not specified in the item description.	0
"Phone was advertised as new other. Listed as in Overstock item. This was not at all true. Pulled up the menu and the phone had over 800 charge cycles on it. It was obviously a used phone. Seller offered to do a partial refund for which I requested $40 as a partial refund. A very reasonable request considering the phone had so many charge cycles on it. Seller then backed out of their offer. Then accused me a feedback blackmail, after they did not respond to me for days. I simply told them that I was not going to be able to leave positive feedback since they had sold me a used phone, then back out of what they had offered to do because of this."	0

"Phone was bought because of cost,  when received it was not functional as listed on EBAY Sine it only cost me a few dollars I did not respond to any feed back and hust threw it in the garbage.

Blew me off. Phone now needs a reset every time I need to use it and sometimes it won't reset first try."	0
"Phone was great at first, but then the touch screen died after 3 months so it is now a paperweight.  Hard to get it fixed since we bought it 2nd hand on eBay.  I&apos;d avoid this phone, especially since this seems like a common issue with this model."	0

The phone had been refurbished badly and apple wont touch it.  Was told the phone is missing parts inside, unable to use phone at all.

The track for the sliding part of the phone was filled with earwax/dirt as well. TERRIBLE job of cleaning the phone. The keyboard was also coated in a thick layer of dust.	0
"Phone was worthless.  Alltel told me the screen was going and within three days it was gone.  Due to a snow storm I didn&apos;t get it activated and learn it was no good within the 7 day return policy, so I can&apos;t comment on that.  Service getting it to me was good, but product was no good."	0

"Phone works well and appears to be new condition- this phone comes with a brushed silver material backplate instead of the black rubbery material backplate on my previous K7- I prefer the non-slip black so I swapped the silver one out. Other than that this phone is a good deal and easily synced up with my old G7 to transfer phone #s, apps, etc. I simply transferred T-Mobile Sim card from old phone to new, restarted new phone and everything worked fine.I have always had great luck with LG phones."	1

"Phone+lightning cable+charger comes in 2 zip lock bags. Not box, but zip lock bags. Missing earpods, missing pin to open SIM card slot. Glass has lots of scratches (not ""light"" imperfections). My 4-year old phone has NOWHERE near the amount of scratches. I bought other refurbished products in the past, and all of them are reconditioned to be like new, not like something that ""fell of the back of a truck"", if you know what I mean. "	0
"Phones description clearly said clean imei, yet Verizon says its listed stolen, cost me a whole day sorting it all out after listing my phone as stolen cause I put my sim card in it, asked for seller to refund,  and agrees ,but I got to pay for return shipping?. Why would I spend more money to a dishonest seller. I mean be truthful  and someone would bought and got it cleaned, or used for parts. Even asked if seller would pay for a imei clean , Nope, blacklisted imei, either stolen, bill wasnt paid on phone, still in payments,reported lost or it was an insurance deal that went bad. Either way I end up with a paperweight.  "	0

"PIECE OF JUNK ! ! ! This phone is a piece of junk, it would not let me put in contacts, use the data plan or much of anything else.  All I could do was to make/receive phone calls, send/receive text and use the alarm feature.  Last night this phone completely died and I want a full refund, you can have your junk back with a PAID RETURN LABEL, this thing has cost me enough money already.  I will be reporting this to BBB and other places if my request is not met immediately.  I'm a senior living on a fixed income and I cannot afford to pay for a phone that does not work, plus paying for a full months service plan that I only got to use between July 7th - July 18th. "	0

"please be aware,-- these cell phones are often offered in a very nice near mint condition. And most of them are just as advertised. But- the cell phone has a mechanical significant  defect,- it is in all cell phones of  this model Rugby cell phone.  The voice of incoming calls is very very badly muffled,- to the point of just being non usable . We just purchased 2 such cell phones,- and have become so frustrated with this defect, that they were just cast  them into the trash. The vendor sent us a very nice phone, it is a Samsun design defect. Do not buy this cell phone."	0

"please DO NOT buy this phone. i had bought in march 2017 and within a months time, i started complaining for the phone getting HOT faster. vendor not helpful as he says its out of vendor's warranty. and yes, the phone which this vendor sells is brand new sealed pack BUT NOT WITH THE MFG""s warrant. when i check with the mfg they confirmed that the phone which i bought is of 2014 or 2015 mfged and out of warranty. So bottom line, its not with the mfg's standard warranty. vendor was also not helpful and was not helping me for this issue and now i am stuck with the phone. anyways, DO NOT BUY, phone battery becoming extremely hot in very less usage time.

POS phone...DO NOT buy this. After about 8months it will fall apart. The internal memory is so low that every time you update your apps you have to delete them because they get too big and won&apos;t save to the SD card. The camera sucks..pix are too dark. It freezes and randomly shuts down and has a hard time running apps that are too animated or &apos;flashy&apos;	0
"Positive  Phone is very durable has stood up to my 2 &amp; 3 year old fighting over it, dropping it numerous times and even a dunking in the toilet.  Long battery life.    Negative.    Phone shutts it self off.  This has occured from the very first day it was active and I bought it from Alltel direct.  Drops calls and shutts off while you are talking.  Is very slow to text message.  I can be on the third or fouth letter and the first letter is just showing up on the screen.  The battery also takes a long time to charge but you don&apos;t have to charge very often :)     Buttons on phone are very small my father, 70 years old, has an extremely hard time using the phone"	0

Pretty good as of now.	1
Pretty much all I was looking for. So far I am pleased and I don't expect that to change. It's a little larger than I would hope for but then I have big fingers and thumbs smaller phone would likely be more frustrating.	1
"Previous owner of the m7 and was hesitant about the m8, but definitely love it! Big thanks to the seller chubbiestech, great price and the phone came in better condition than I was expecting! Bought two of them and they were both perfect, been using for about two months and no problem with them yet!"	1
price right and the phone was what i was looking for.  Have been looking for phone and finally  found this one	1
Price was excellent. Shipped very quickly. Product was new in the box. Could not be more satisfied. This was my first tech type buy. I was a little cautious so I purchased the squaretrade warrenty. I was also very satisfied with that transaction. The phone has lived up to my expectations. Thanks	1
price was great lots of features love the big numbers and the little covers for all the places to plug charger and headphones in also accessories are easy to find  motorola razor accessories fit.	1
Priced reasonable. Excellent customer contact. Fast delivery. I would recommend this company. Love my phone	1
"Primero el vendedor me envio un producto diferente al descrito en link.  Ejemplo: Este celular vino con el color diferente al descrito en el mismo, ademas que no trajo su cargador y ademas no espesifico cual era el defecto que este mismo traia.   En resumen compre un producto que era completamente inservible.  PPT: Perdi mi dinero. Y opte por retirarme de la pagina de Ebay. Lamento tener que esperar estos 60 dias para completar el proceso de retiro."	0
"PRO:  Does very well for what this modern phone was designed to do; talking, texting, Bluetooth-ing, Web browsing, and GREAT while using this phone as phone-as-modem via Bluetooth tethering with a Bluetooth-enabled laptop PC.  Nice usable slide-out keyboard. Typically nice large capacity LG phone Contacts listings with large characters capacity-per-Contacts listing.    CON:  Would be slightly nicer for us Right-handed folks if the Left-side buttons were instead relocated to the Right-side when used horizontally with the slide-out QWERTY keyboard.  Regard that as more of a comment than as a complaint."	1

"Product was not new, as indicated in the post and on top of that nothing works properly. Camera swithes off when I switched to video mode. The memory card was fried after 3 days.  The customer service was good and the replied in a timely manner, but they  were aware of the poor qaulity of their products because they even made the  mistake of telling me that people always complain about the charger not working too."	0
"Product was recived quick and as described, exceeded my expectations in cosmetic look & I'm a happy buyer!."	1
"Product was shipped fast but as I took the cell phone out the box and was inspecting it because the description said "" seller refurbished and minor scuffs on body but works 100%"" yet on it were actually no scuffs on the body but the charging port was damaged... How am I supposed to charge this phone comfortably without worrying that it will someday catch fire? This phone is overly priced, it should cost $30... Will be returning it immediately and requesting a refund!"	0

PROPERLY DESCRIBED FASS SHIPPING ALL SELLERS SHOULD BE BROUGHT TO A STANDARD THAT THEY LIVE UP TP THERE DISCRIPTION.OR ELSE. VAIGUE DISCRIPTION SHOULD BE TREATED LIKELY .	1
"Pros, none. Cons, stopped working after 32 days. Just outside the return time. How convenient. $450.00 paper weight."	0
"Pros: - loooooooooooooooooong lasting battery (went for 2 days skiing trip with below freezing temps, took some pics, exchanged some messages, surfed the net in the evening and got back with 50% battery, no charger needed) - global bands - full hd display (I don't need more in the 6"" cell phone and it saves battery) - freshly updated Android 8 - Leica camera - costs less than arm and leg (but still expensive if you ask me)  Cons: - Huawei does not sell genuine spare parts (and that's why I had to get this one in the first place as I cannot find genuine Mate 8 display) - it is probably my last Huawei phone as they decided to follow Samsung and Apple with the craziness of screen resolution and price - it is made in a communist country that does not respect human rights"	1
"Pros: Fits in my pocket, long battery life, spectacular resolution, useful amount of memory,   Cons: beveled edge took some getting used to; I kept accidentally selecting things I didn't intend; I resolved the issue when I purchased a cover that wrapped around the sides enough to preclude my accidentally touching the screen, I miss being able to replace my own battery--but I guess those days are long gone, Bixby button and interface--just plain annoying"	1
"Pros: Great Screen Resolution, Lock Screen Music Controls, Walkman Player, NFC, Camera, HDMI out, nice weight    Cons: Capactive Buttons, Screen Scratches easily    I&apos;ve had this phone for little over a month, running with Straight Talk through AT&amp;T and I really enjoy the phone. Coming from Windows Phone Android was a different experience. This phone tickled my fancy because I really enjoy Sony products and the price was right for a new Unlocked Phone.    The Good:  The screen is beautiful, I&apos;ll say that. With the crisp resolution and beautiful colors, it really does a great job at showing everything. The speaker on the back with the xLoud technology does get very loud, however I worry about blowing it out occasionally.  The front and rear facing camera both work really well for taking pictures, and Google+ hangouts work perfectly with the front facing camera (Just don&apos;t expect the battery to last too terribly long while video chatting).  Everything works really well, and the PSM store, while still new, works great! Haven&apos;t downloaded any games yet, but I will once some look appetizing.    Cons:  The screen scratches a little too easily. You can&apos;t see the scratches unless you look really closely, but just putting the phone in and out of my jeans pocket has left two scratches, or it could have been from a cleaning cloth.  The capacitive buttons on the strip work when you exactly(!) tap them on the dot, otherwise they sorta kinda don&apos;t work. It would have been great had a larger area been used for recognizing your finger, but you&apos;ll get used to it eventually.  The auto-correct is pretty underwhelming, coming from Windows Phone it saddens me. (This may just be a fluke of Android, and not the phone itself though).  I still haven&apos;t found a way to set a ringtone or music clip for a text message sound, and notice that since these phones are not from a carrier, the selection of ringtones or text blips are only about 6 or so total.    Overall:  This is a great phone, yes it&apos;s not the fastest or best newest phone model, but it really does well with what it has to offer. Incredibly stable, with only a few weird audio problems (Will occasionally cause music to pause while loading pages), but other than that no problems at all"	1
"Pros: Loaded With Features; Easy to Use; Great Sound and Reception  Cons: No Support for Different Ringer Profiles (i.e., Soft, Loud, Off)    This phone is by far the best Sprint phone I have ever had.  It&apos;s loaded with lots of great features.  It is GPS capable with turn by turn voice directions.  It&apos;s got a great media player built in and has excellent video quality.  There&apos;s plenty of screen space on this phone.  The ringers are loud and clear for their volume.  It&apos;s a bit large compared to other phones, but it&apos;s capabilities definitely outweigh that.  It&apos;s also highly durable.    There is no capability to have different ringer profiles, but you can adjust the volume and vibration.    All said, I give this phone a 5/5.  If you find a good price on this phone, I definitely say get it."	1
"Pros: Nice keyboard good click response, using trackball to navigate is easy, nice screen, small and can fit in any pocket, camera w/ Flash, SureType (great for fast texters!)802.11b works great and other generous little features.    Cons: Speaker and microphone could be a tad louder, battery case is fragile a case for the phone is recommended, somewhat short battery life.    Other than that, this is a great solid phone for those looking to buy an inexpensive starter business phone. With built in wi-fi, dual-band GSM, and a bunch of other neat little features this phone delivers exceptional performance for the price."	1
PROS: Small and compact.      CONS: Maybe a little too small for someone with large hands.  Cheap material.      SUMMARY: One of the cheapest (in price and quality) phones you can get from AT&amp;T.  Spend a little more money and get one that you will enjoy more.  I do not recommend buying this unless you have handled it first.	0
"Pros: This phone is a very user friendly phone. I love the ability to assign ring tones to certain people in my contact list. Gets great signals, and is very compact.    Cons: Like most nextel phones, it&apos;s hard to add your own ringtones and wallpaper to the phone without the proper software and drivers."	1

Purchased a unscanned tracfone. Thought i was getting a good deal. Wrong//. I am a senior & thought it would be a good phone. Didn't know i was being duped. Cannot add minutes to phone because it was stollen. I contacted seller 4 times & got no response. I got scammed & hope others do not purchase from this seller. Bad bad bad.  How can ebay let these people sell unscanned items when they know they cannot be used?	0

"Purchased for my wife, who was anti-Apple and preferred her Blackberry.  Her greatest challenge was adapting to touchscreen keys vs Blackberry QWERTY keyboard.  But after playing games, sending text and emails with my iPhone 4, she wanted one too.  Now, she wants to use it to train for her marathons!  The white color is a long awaited feature, which she loves..."	1
Purchased galaxy 7s edge and all is fantastic.  Great seller.  Excellent price and fast shipping.   I purchased from this seller before and Is very consistent . highly recommended.  	1
Purchased item and marked as shipped till this day I have not received  the item	0
"purchased item was suppose to be new, and in a sealed box. upon receipt of item , said item was unsealed, in a box belonging to a different cellphone model (a Galaxy S 2 ), with no instructions, and upon placing sim card in cellphone, ( used by the way ), said phone was defective. Very disappointed in the false advertisement by the merchant and E bay. As of this review, June 12, 2013, have been unable to contact the merchant or E bay for a return label and a full refund."	0
"Purchased Nokia 2705 for my spouse.  Phone is very small but nice looking.  Reception is modest and able to connect with bluetooth device with ease.  Phone worked well for about 1.5 weeks.  Problems with spouse not being to hear me and constant &quot;hellos&quot; with no response.  Phone would not pick up, dropped calls in otherwise close to Verizon tower areas my previous razor phone had no problems with.  Calls went directly to voicemail sometimes.  Many problems and my spouse wants to replace it.  Seller will not respond to my attempts to contact!  I am stuck with a stupid phone that only works sometimes.  I would not recommend this phone!"	0
"Purchased on the 4th and supposed to receive item by the 7th -11th.  Messaged  three days before delivery to make sure it was coming, then two days, then 1 day no response.  Now I have to wait till the 18th for eBay to step in to get my money back. "	0
"Purchased phone because I wanted a low cost simple phone. Phone works, but has poor reception at times. I have other phones that have better reception."	0
"purchased Phone to replace my moms old one, she can&apos;t work the new ones. This one the buttons locked up the same day we got it. would not recommend this phone."	0
purchased the cellphone to replace my dead phone. The send and end buttons are reversed so sometimes you forget and make another call unintentionally. battery life is not long when talking on the phone charing time is too long. buttons are too small and hard to push. works ok if just buying a phone to hold you over til your next plan renew. It&apos;s also hard to set alarms.	0
Purchased the J7 when updating a Galaxy S3 on Virgin Mobile.  We couldn't believe the value for this relatively inexpensive phone.  Nice size with a big screen and nice keyboard with numbers on the qwerty face.  We just changed carriers to T Mobile for a lower priced unlimited deal and bought two new J7s (but GSM vs. CDMA).  Highly recommended.	1
Purchased the phone for my great grandparent the phone is complicated to use have to press 3-4 buttons just to make a call	0
"Purchased the Sanyo Katana on e-bay to replace the phone which fell into the swimming pool.  The phone is very durable, keypad has withstood thousands of text messages and the battery will last 2 to 3 days.  Great little phone for the price."	1
"Purchased this device for the good price; however, don't be fooled. The speaker did not work sounds very muffled so I contacted seller and all he/she said take it to the apple store! Ugh no I just purchased this there should be no reason for an issue like this! PLEASE DO NOT BUY PRODUCTS FROM THIS SELLER!!! Go elsewhere as you will get no help here."	0

"Purchased this iPhone 8 to replace a 5.  This refurbished unit had no detectable blemishes or scratches, it accepted and worked flawlessly with my Total Wireless account on the Verizon network, and I saved about 40% off the price of a new unit from apple."	1
"Purchased this Iphone unlocked and jail broken, I live in Mexico so when it arrived tel cell Carlos Slims co. could not activate it and I have not been able to use it at all. Sellers son unlocked the phone or said he did, promised to email instructions to unlock it&quot;nothing yet&quot; still waiting..... Not very happy with this purchase or the seller.... Its been over 45 days so can not complain to E Bay either. If anyone can help me please let me know!!!  Thanks Christian Robertson 209-810-5510"	0
Purchased this phone advertised as Virgin Mobile.  Virgin Mobile says it isn't. Have phone number to call and it says no waiting.  Yet four calls later all I get is an answering machine.  Left message.  The sim card in it says Sprint.  When try to active online it says activation is BoostMobile.  As of this writing I have received no call back from them	0
Purchased this phone for my daughter. She had been asking for it since it came out. Needless to say but she loved it! 	1
Purchased this phone for my son to replace his broken Razor. The SLVR L7 is a quality phone with good features.  We live in a rural area and the coverage is great! MP3 and Push to Talk features are very easy to use. He hasn&apos;t had any problems at all and is very pleased with the phone.	1
"Purchased this phone under the idea it was a new phone, since it was listed as such. Wanted a temporary upgrade from my Note 3 till the Note 8 drops. What I received was a literal joke. Immediately noticed excessive wear around the charging port upon opening the already opened box. Not that big a deal, proceeded to swap my sim card in and transfer service.   First white screen I was on I noticed the keyboard and multiple other things burned very clearly into the screen. And a small portion of the picture on the top of the screen is distorted on top of the fact it seems the antenna may be worn out a bit, as not once during the entire day I ran it did it get more then three bars in an area with excellent service. While trying to launch the ebay app to message the sellers the phone randomly reset on me. Did this about 3 or 4 more times before I managed to get the app opened. Took them a little over a day to even respond and when they did gave me a very vague response with little to no instructions on what they were going to do.  They ended up claiming it was a mistake but didnt go any further into detail. Eventually ended up sending me a return label and Im still waiting to hear back as to whether Im actually getting a refund or a properly ""new"" phone sent to me. Anyone looking to b"	0

"READ SUMMARY        Cons: READ SUMMARY        Summary: I purchased the device for my use as a phone that I&apos;d use for trips. I barely had the phone for 2 weeks, and the phone crapped out on me. I REALLY love Samsung electronics (why I have a Samsung device at the moment) but phone&apos;s SHOULD be engineered to last a 2 year commitment (not 2 weeks)        My issues:      Ok, so since I have a smartphone, I WAS going to use this phone for trips as I mentioned, so that nothing happened to my current phone. well, if your going to go on scenic trips, you&apos;d probably want to use a camera, wouldn&apos;t you. You see, I have a digital camera, yes, but I use it for video, I don&apos;t use it to lug around and take pictures of stuff, I want a convenient little pocket sized camera that can be used as a phone, and maybe a few more little features, but the camera on this thing would NEVER START. It would either say something about DEVICE CAMERA ERROR, or Camera error. One time it did open, but the resolution was crappy. I convinced Verizon that this phone was basically BROKEN and they offered to send me another Gusto, and I thought, OK, fine, maybe it will function better, well, I had it fixed my camera issue, but now came down to a newer issue. 2,3,6 and 9 keys switched positions nearly every time I had to dial a number, so you were left pressing keys repeatedly until you knew what key was assigned to which button, AND thank goodness for Backup Assistant, as that helped for the numbers I didn&apos;t have saved. I took it back to the store I had gotten it from (Verizon) and since I was in my 15 day return period, they let me choose an LG COSMOS 2 which so far I&apos;m loving. I tried to go simple, but this phone really could only compare to a car phone, that bad of a phone. If you want a simple phone, go with the LG Revere, the Accolade (I ONCE HAD) and the Gusto, are not worth your time!"	0

"really love this phone, its so awesome -- the turquoise color is really girly (the other version of this phone is black/orange=guyish)  the keys are a lot better than my other phone (Samsung T401G)  if you want an alternate to the rumor/rumor 2, this is your phone!!    &quot;MY Pros&quot;:  color=turquoise!  social networking/menu styles  lots of ringtones  customizable backgrounds (banner/clock)    &quot;MY Cons&quot;:  cheaper feeling than the Rumor--you can shift the thinner/top portion from side to side (opposite of opening keyboard)  keys are hard to press on QWERTY - firmer on Rumor    if you are &quot;dutch&quot; or want a cool looking popular phone, snag this one! it is expensive brand new (prepaid) but not bad pricing for 2yr contract...  note: at first you feel the keyboard is hard to press, but after awhile i think you would get used to it :)"	1
Really nice phone.    1) It looks nicer   2) has a normal ear phone jack  3) Slightly larger screen (by a hair)  4) Wider keyboard keys  5) Half the price of the original at launch ($300)    big qwerty keyboard and very easy to use.....as compared to texting o the iphone and I love the ultimate inbox	1

"Really sexy phone. Number keys are a little small, but it makes the phone look way cooler. The phone also has a couple of built in lights to use in the dark which is pretty cool. I wish the battery life was a little better though. If you get a usb charger data cable you can transfer mp3s from your computer. Pretty neat phone for its size, wish they still made them."	1
"Really this phone is not working properly, but my experience with Chinese buying is that it is virtually impossible to return the items, because the cost is very high, as happened with cell HTC One X bought 2011bigbigworl, who insisted to me that there was a service USPS return that does not really exist, and forward the phone was more expensive than the phone itself, so I had to stay with a defective item which was sold as &quot;good condition.&quot;"	0

"Received the phone and NEVER WORKED. It said brand new, although it never came in an original branded box. It came in an envelop and the phone was wrapped in bubble wrap. Unless I am completely offbase, the phone is nothing like the ones you have here in the US. The weight is different, the keypad is useless was completely different. The phone looks, feels and smells like a cheap knock-off. The only think that looked real was the charger. I DO NOT believe that Motorola would dare to put such a crappy product on the market.   I then saw that the phone came directly from China and by the looks of the packaging this looks like the phone was either refurbished or a total fake. I know that the phones are made there, but don&apos;t take me for an idiot.   I paid $50, thought of returning but it would have to go back to China, go through a whole process to then get it back. Whole thing could take weeks as it took 2 weeks for me to get the phone. From my calculations, my aggravation is worth more than $50 and all the paperwork, emails, etc... that would have taken place.  i will just repurpose the battery on my old phone. I guess I paid $50 for a new battery.     I lost all trust with this vendor.I would not buy from them. FAKE, FAKE, FAKE."	0

"Received the Samsung S7 Edge on June 6, on Sept 28 (less than 4 months) the screen started blinking and you could not read the screen (ie text, email, phone dialing) all text sets behind a green screen resulting in unreadable screen. Not a nick on the phone, never dropped just an inferior product, not deserving of the classification new-other. Ebay suppliers are a crap shoot, my last phone from them was a beast, 3.5 good years."	0
"Received this phone for only a couple of days, haven't yet thoroughly evaluated every function of the phone. But its battery life is a joke! Fully charged it last night around 11pm. This morning when I woke up at 7am, the battery had only 12% left! All settings are original (i.e., factory setting). So even on standby it won't be able to last 10 hours, let alone the 20 days the manufacturer claims, unless the battery is not new or not an OEM. May have to return it."	0
Received two FedEx tracking numbers from seller. They were both INVALID numbers. This must be the 8th time I purchased thru EBAY and  never receive the item. The only thing I get is the refund after waiting days and even weeks. Ebay should do a better job and even penalize the these unscrupulous sellers. 	0

The fact that it is an unlocked phone so that I can use it with any service, helps tremendously. Delivery was fast. Would definitely order again. Thank you."	1
"Reception is good, way better than my old RAZR.  I&apos;m a H.S. Teacher and all my students really like the stylish looks of my new phone.   I don&apos;t text, but a few of them liked that the phone has a small keypad area so texting is faster.    The keypad has a great feel, I like the responsiveness of the buttons.  My phone came from Hong Kong apparently, the games are in some flavor of Chinese.  There are even Chinese characters on the keypad.  That&apos;s cool stuff to me.  Bluetooth works well, I sync it to my MacBook Pro using Apple&apos;s iSync software.  Contacts and Calendars sync perfectly.  Even the Contact photos sync too.  I really like this phone."	1

"Recieved item with small crack in screen. At first I thought it wad just a scratch because it was listed as having small scratches,  until I took it to the cell phone store to have a screen protector put on and they confirmed it was a crack.  Unfortunately I planned on keeping the phone,  so I threw athwart the packaging it came in so I can't even return it (not original packaging either). Also the finger print scanner doesn't work.  Basically I bought a broken ass phone with the worst screen burnout ever.  Yay me. The battery life sucks worse then my 5 year old nexus phone. "	0

"Remeber the Sanyo 4920? That phone was tough as heck. This phone is the same and even better! It has rubber sides all over it making it almost indestructible. It has one of the best reception phones Sprint offers.     However, it does lack EVDO and a camera. But depending on your needs, you might think this phone is prefect for you.     Pros: High battery life, good protected screen, and fast charging.    Cons: A little bulky, and speaker phone isn&apos;t the best"	1

Right now the best Cell Phone in the market is Samsung Galaxy S4 16GB there is several color to choose from but the most picked up is the White Color for that reason you will see on eBay the used White S 4 is too much on demand and you will notice the price is higher than the other ones.	1

The fast tap makes texting so easy for me, but the phone will actually restart WHILE in in the middle of a text. It&apos;s horribly inconvenient. You can also not use customized ringtones for Text alert tones. For text alerts, you can only use the 5 hardcoded sounds. I feel like I wasted the $250 on this phone."	0

Save your money. The battery life is terrible. It is not a user friendly phone. I have downloaded some games but trying to play them is another story by itself. I wish I had my old flip phone back. I will definitely look for something else. Worst phone I have ever owned. Battery life is horrible. I purchased a new linger life battery and can't get more then 1/2 a day before I have to charge again. My old flip phone I charged about once a week. So much junk on here I don't need or want. Forget all the bells and whistles and just make a good phone instead.	0
"Saves a lot of money getting a new one. Phone looks new, works absolutely well, and timely delivery. A good deal"	1
"say goodluck with your money with this clone,.. i bought a clone note 9 when i went in the philippines and its more cheaper only cost me $200 something and yup you will get almost the same looks, but the performance?? lol everything is not in here camera specially and get ready for a very slow internet connection"	0

"scratched screen, highly doubt it&apos;s manufacturer refurbed...  the sticker on the screen looked like it had been taken off something else covered in lint"	0
"Screen cracks easily; very expensive to repair. We purchased 4 of these phones about a year ago - BREED was the seller via Ebay. So far, 3 of 4 phones have suffered cracked screens - 2 while having protective cases on them. Screen on first phone cracked when we were trying to open the back in order to insert the SIM card. The instruction book sent with the phone was for a Lumia 920 instead of the 820, giving us incorrect instructions for opening the back. (We figured this out later when we attempted to contact Nokia (hopeless) and happened on the instruction manuals online.) BREED would not take responsibility and exchange the phone even though the crack resulted because the manual shipped by them with the phone was wrong. Repair for 1st phone cost $75. Second phone - rather typical drop from table to floor, resulting in cracked screen and another $75 repair. 3rd phone dropped - also rather typical drop, resulted in fatal crack - i.e. this time LCD was also damaged so that repair would have cost $150!!!!    Another issue we encountered was that the ability to sent/receive group messages and pictures suddenly ceased. Still have not figured out how to fix that issue.    These phone definitely are not worth the price unless you purchase insurance and even then you are likely to be spending time fixing the phone. BEWARE"	0

Screen looked like it had been replaced and you could see glue on one side. Touchscreen seemed like it was missing my touches. Phone Info app said the phone was originally white, but I bought it as black. The phone itself is nice big phone, stylus is a great feature, size a bit too much for me. Haven't had chance to test how everything works because I felt cheated and returned the phone.  Specs-wise the phone promises to me a workhorse with tons of features, a little outdated but still awesome product. "	0

"Seller writes not to &quot;pester&quot; with queries right away but to wait a few days, so I didn&apos;t. I received my item on time. Don&apos;t get turned off, I didn&apos;t see the &quot;shipped&quot; icon after 5 days so I got concerned. I figured if it didn&apos;t arrive yet thats ok but not to even ship it?! I wrote a message to the seller requesting an explanation. At the last second I decided not to send the message, but to wait another day. When I got home my wife mentioned that &quot;yesterday&quot; a package came in the mail. I looked at the website and it still didn&apos;t have the &quot;shipped&quot; icon. They forgot to post the icon as &quot;sent&quot;, but I got it fast. Also, I looked at the postage and it cost them about $6.00. which means they didn&apos;t make anything extra on the handling.

Shipping was fast and accurate but the phone came with visible sign of scratches on screen where I would consider poor condition in which my perspective its poor condition.

Shipping was quick.  Phone was purchased for an older person so it easier for the person to use.  Thank you	1
Shipping was super fast. Great phones for the money. Would buy from again.	1

"Should you be considering purchasing Boost Mobile Phone there are some things you should know.You must pay the dollar to walkie even if you don&apos;t answer.If your friends bleep you and you are trying to be thrifty with your money spent on this product...well,Boost is raking it in.They charge you for taking your messages even if it&apos;s from your own phone.20 cents a minute during day time hours is outrageous.10 cents at night doesn&apos;t help when you consider most people won&apos;t call after that hour.They have no 24/7 customer care for prepaid services.If you don&apos;t need the service during certain times and decide to let the minutes run out,please note they have restrictions on the amount of time your phone can be left empty and will eventually charge you the new package price over again.And here&apos;s the biggest problem I had with them.I got my phone, hooked it up via my home phone.When I got my number from customer service,I repeated it back to her to make sure it was correct,(always do this).She stated that everything was correct and ready to go.The number was given out to friends and a few business acqaintances.I put an extra 20 dollar card in to get the bonus they told me about.It turns out I credited someone else&apos;s account because the wrong number was given to me.When I checked on my minutes and figured out what the problem was,I tried to get through to them imediately.You would think with the amount of money they are pulling in for this lousy service, they could offer customer care any time of day.I had to wait till the following morning when they put me through to 4 different people and I spent almost an hour talking,asked to speak to the manager and was told he was not on sight.The 4th person I spoke with told me he would help me by filling out a form and I should call back the following day at noon to find out if my account had been credited.I was told that they could do nothing for me and if I wanted to take the phone back that was my business but my 20$ pin card would not be given back.The same night I took the phone back to Walmart where I had to wait for two hours because they needed a particular employee to call to deactivate the phone because Boost should have done this but they didn&apos;t.They never even mentioned it.The staff at Boost Mobile obviously do not like to work.They are good at misrepresenting a company which lacks good business ethics to say the least.The manager with the skills,when he showed up at the counter,was vey pleasant,and,considering there was another person a few feet from me with same problem,decided to try to handle both of us at the same time.Although he was able to get the other person a refund,(I doubt it happens often),he could not get me one.The reason they stated was that the description was vague.I guess they felt that almost an hour on the phone with 4 inadequate employees was not enough.What,I wonder,was the reason they gave for refunding this other person,seeing as he didn&apos;t even fill out a report?Here&apos;s the clincher.I tried,without luck, to contact the person who actually owned the number to tell him about the money he would be spending answering my calls.I could not get through.He is going to be putting more money into HIS Boost account now.I&apos;ve never seen such a rip off as this!If you are looking for an inexpensive way to keep in touch with family and friends,look into Cingular or Sprint.Considering the lousy service,rude employees and high price,I&apos;m surprised Boost ranks at all in the search engines."	0

"Siemens (Siemens &amp; BenQ combination) SL75 looks fantastic!  It&apos;s small, light, functional and user friendly.  However, the Siemens/BenQ work-together is no more.  This means no support since JAN07 when the company disbanded.  The support (be it customer service or technical) have been disconnected, so don&apos;t expect to get any help from the company.    The phone is fantastic until it really needs a firmware update. (Usually this is a couple of months of use.) You are required to use the computer cable to update the firmware...and you will (cannot use Bluetooth for this part), so be sure to get the computer cable if you make the purchase.    The sound quality is great, phone options are fantastic, plays music, BT accessible, internet, good memory, MS Outlook connectivity, stays looking at the top of the game.  If the companies had stayed together, then I&apos;d give this an excellent; however, that didn&apos;t happen."	0

"Simply the best, the phone was smaller than Asus Zenfone 5 with 5 inch display, that's awesome! I was sad about small capacity of battery,  but after use nice tasking 7 hours i just use a half of battery, that's great!  Camera is so awesome."	1

Slow and charged $20 return..not advertised correctly 	0
slow processor. i read the reviews saying it was slow but really slow. great interface but very familiar similar in for form and function to the E71 and E72 except for more advancements to UI but no upgrade in processor to make those tweaks quick and rapidly achievable.	0
Slow to ship (3 days from payment) and even slower to refund (5 days AFTER the return was received in the EXACT specifications requested by the seller) when the promise of the phone being unlocked and available for USCellular was not the case. 	0

so apparently my aunt loved the phone so much I had to buy a second pair for her.  Honestly for a used phone it looks amazing n the interface is good as well. For a blu it's not bad at all  	1
So bought 2 lg g6 phones 1 worked the other 1 did.dont understand why send something is not is not working i mean the least ppl can do is make sure you can make a good phone call. I received the phone with 0 audio the earpiece was bad cant hear anything at all..	0
So far - so good.  I like all the features.  The only complaint I have is that the unlock key on the touchpad is a little flaky.  Everything else about the phone is fantastic.	1
"So far I am impressed. The package came on time, the phone came with everything that was specified (charger and wall plug). Had to look very hard to find the one and only one scratch on the phone. Other than that it looked brand new. I am pretty happy with this purchase. Only thing I have yet to test out is the battery life of the phone since I have only had it for an hour or so. I will refer back to my review when I know how the battery holds up. Other than that, phone powered on, it came unlocked and once I put the sim card from my current phone into it, it worked right away. Fully functional and the cosmetics just about flawless. Big thanks."	1
So far I'm really impressed with its power and speed. I am still learning all the features. I am so glad I got the 8 gig of RAM	1
So far it is doing the job.	1
So far its done every thing Ive tried.  Just wish it would have come with the case and memory card. Which I will buy .	1
So far not what was in the add  I got a att note 4 it was Samsung account locked and the other phone wouldn't turn on  had to return them did not work like add said 	0
So far so good the only complaint is it charges slow but holds the charge very well.	1
"So far so good, got much better with Android 9 than the way it was out of the box."	1
So far so good.  This device was activated minus incident.	1
So far so good. Exactly  as expected! Great value. I'm  glad i got it.	1
So far so good. I wish the battery would stay charged longer but overall happy. Still getting used to the keypad.	1
"So far so good... as described.  Interested to see how battery life etc. works out.  Thanks for a nice clean, quality product"	1
"So far the phone works fine. Has burns in the LCD but seems to be working okay right now it is NOT a galaxy note 4 edge it is just a edge so that is not a good thing to realize when you receive a product, noticing it is not the product you paid money for is completely upsetting. "	0
So far this Samsung Note 4 performs great as expected. It is in like-new condition. Only one small problem...the battery is a cheap Chinese imitation and would not hold a charge. I have replaced the battery and all charging problems disappeared. This is an AT&T phone that I am using with T-Mobile and so far no problems with the small exception  of having to deal with all the AT&T bloatware loaded on the phone that I disabled. I have owned one other Note 4 that I was very happy with. So far this one is working as good as my first one.	1
"So far very satisfied.   Great camera.  Nice OLED screen.  Very good battery life.  Nice stock Android.  Many other very nice features.  Here are some minor complaints:  1) The phone has no LED for notifications, which I became accustomed to on prior Android phones I've owned.  2) It seems that rapid charging does not activate with my Qualcomm 3.0 compatible quick chargers, yet these work as expected on my prior quickcharge-compatible phone.  Only the charger that came with the Pixel phone will rapid charge. 3) Cannot turn off or relocate a top-of-homescreen widget-like app that shows date and current weather.  4) Cannot remove Google search bar from bottom of home screen (it seems).  5)  I'm not that crazy about the ""Overview"" task switcher in Pie.   But overall I am very pleased with the phone."	1
"So far, I absolutely love the iPhone 3GS with iOS5! The only downside to this device is that the phone shuts off randomly at around 30%. I think this is just a software glitch that easily be fixed. Other than that, the device is great. I love the ease of access; setting up my email was a breeze, and i loaded all my photos and music easily. This phone is a great buy!"	1
"So far, so good. Replaced my year old Samsung S8+ with this one, as the GPS stopped functioning on the old phone. Not too impressed with that, but can't complain about the S9+ to-date."	1
so glad it was here and worked as a charger and an extra battery	1
So happy phone is like brand new. Will order again	1
"So happy with my new cellphone, excellent buy"	1
So happy with this seller 100% looks new I am very happy with my buy!!! 	1
"So I bought this and kept it hidden, it was a gift for my mom to give to her today mothers day, I gave it to her she was really happy but when we took it to get a line on Metro it did not work they said the part where the chip goes was missing something, that made it impossible for the phone to read the sim card."	0
"So i bought this phone for my little baby boy and i didnt want to get him a smart phone yet. So i have purchased a basic phone for my kid just for couple years use. But when i receive this device i was shocked and angry. The phone was used, and it had naked pictures of women. they didn't master reset the device nor they erase any call logs etc. i contacted the seller they said i will give you the money back. But do i care about the money at this point? im seriously mad how they are irresponsible for their products before they send the customers"	0
"So I got this phone. I tried to have it activated, but the problem was that they said the ESN was already in use. I contacted the seller many times about this + she said that she purchased the phone with NO PLAN. I believed her as she is an honest person. Anyways, Helio customer service is pretty much non existent. When i called them, they told me that I was SOL. I called again + one lady told me to check back in a few days as they were going to check out if the phone was actually being used. When I called back, I got the same run around + was again told to call back later. I did this about 3 or so times, then I was fed up. I asked to speak to the highest person that I could. The person on the other end of the phone refused to do that + asked what the problem was. I once again explained it to him. He then gave me the same story that i was SOL. I ended up hanging up on him because of his rudeness + lack of any help what so ever. Helio is a horrible company + they have no customer service what so ever. I&apos;m so mad that I can&apos;t get my phone activated because the ESN is &apos;already being used.&apos; That&apos;s a crock. It&apos;s not being used either. I refuse to ever use this phone company in the future. I refuse to give them any service + STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU NEVER GET A PHONE FROM THIS COMPANY!!!! If anything ever goes wrong with it, you will have to go through the same crap that I did. This is ridiculous. You would think a new company would help out its customers to build a good reputation, but this one didn&apos;t. Stay away from them!!! Who cares if they have myspace on their phones anyways? All other phones that have internet on them can get to it anyways. Once again, STAY AWAY FROM THIS PHONE COMPANY!!!!!!"	0

"So I have had almost all the diferent kinds of major brand smartphones (apple iphone, LG, Motorolla Droid, and a few more...) I have to say... This is THE BEST phone I've had. Totally easy to customize, to root, and to program. It has every feature I could ask for. I actually switched back from my New LG G5 to the G3 because the G5 had problems with GPS location... not the G3. The ONLY thing that sucks, is the battery life. But, in exchange it has amazing display. "	1
"So I made the switch from using Android to the iPhone back in October, and I&apos;ve been using the iPhone 4s for the past few months now and can give a detailed review on what it&apos;s like to switch over. Before this switch, I&apos;ve used the Samsung Galaxy S2 (first smartphone ever!) and also the Nexus 4. Since I&apos;m a tech enthusiast, I&apos;m well versed and have played around with many other Android devices, including all the big names, Galaxy S5, HTC One M8 and M7, One Plus One, and so on. Here are my thoughts:"	1
"So I read and read about this phone before I finally purchased it and decided, despite the one issue I could find with battery life, everyone seemed to give this phone high marks.  They were right.  This phone is great.  It is fast, well designed, light, and just looks great.  I worried that going from the Iphone to an android phone would be hard, but that was not the case.  The transition was very easy, and not being tied to ITunes is wonderful.    The one thing bad I can say was the battery.  The battery lasted maximum of about 7 hours of standby, which was just unacceptable.  I took everyones advice and turned off Widgets, and made sure to routinely kill processes running in the background.  None of this worked.  After talking to a friend, they mentioned going into the Android Market application and turning Download notifications off.  They said they read somewhere that this was a bug in 2.1.  I did this and my battery life went from 7 hours to about 12 hours.  I was amazed that this issue would cause that much unneeded battery consumption.  After doing a little more research, I read that people who moved their phone to Android 2.2 were getting amazing speed and battery life out of our Aria.  The one problem is the Android 2.2 install is not official.  I am holding off on 2.2 in hopes that AT&amp;T and HTC see that 2.1 is a big issue for this phone and really push for 2.2 soon.      I find it funny that after all the battery bashing that&apos;s going on about this phone on the internet, it turns out not to be the battery, but the Android 2.1 OS and HTC Sense.  I think HTC should step up to the plate and deliver 2.2 ASAP for this phone or offer a solution to the battery issue (besides the whole full discharge thing which doesn&apos;t work).      I give the phone an Excellent rating because I know it has huge potential.  I give HTC a Below average rating because they failed to test this phone and advertise longer battery life than it actually delivers with their base install."	1
So I was expecting a used refurbished phone with some minor flaws... The phone I received is in new condition! You would never know it was refurbished. Of course needless to say the phone works great! I would highly recommend this seller to anyone.	1
"So satisfied by this purchase.i was excited to get this phone and wasn&apos;t disappointed using it.Fast response,without any bugs,huge performance.Good decision for alls goals.One thing:i&apos;d like to compare it with htc inspire and ought to say that htc&apos;s browser and interface more pleasant or maybe better to say easier in using,but htc has bugs,and its bored."	1
"So sorry to have a bad review; but the phone does not work at all when it arrived. It could not charge/ turned on...it wasted my waiting time, but I do have my refund back. "	0
"So this is my first smartphone and I put a little research into it before I bought one.  Although pushing 2 years old (july 2008) this phone still packs a punch compared to most phones out there.  Front camera works great with Fring for video chats. I run GPS without the assist from data, as I don&apos;t use data, and it takes pretty long, like 5-15 minutes.. I don&apos;t mind, because I know when I&apos;m going to need it and turn it on before I leave, but just a heads up.  The Symbian OS I wouldn&apos;t say is the greatest OS out there, but I wouldn&apos;t bash it as most people do.  It&apos;s pretty responsive for most things that I want to do and works great for me.  The features on the phone are just such an upgrade from last.  Music player works great.  Browsing is great on wifi, but I&apos;ve never used 3G.  Heard only 3G on AT&amp;T, not T-mobile.  Keys are spaced a good distance apart.  May take a little getting used to, but I think they&apos;re great.  The quick touch shortcuts work great for me and you can customize them as you want.  I get about 3 days on battery life using a decent amount of text and web... little talk time.    Well I&apos;m not really sure what to say, but I thoroughly enjoy this phone.  I would say avoid the e72 as it doesn&apos;t seem like much of an upgrade.  The middle button is like a pad and it runs a better processor, but you&apos;re not gonna get much more out of the extra 100-200 dollars you pay for it.  Phone is also very sleek and thin, something you don&apos;t get out of many phones anymore."	1
"So, I ordered this Jitterbug phone from seller newynewynewy1 as a Christmas gift. Upon trying to activate, I learned that this model phone is so old it cannot be activated. I want a full refund but cannot contact the seller because the return by date has passed. But, selling an obsolete item should be considered a special circumstance. "	0

Also when I send images/picture messages it doesn&apos;t always send and it takes more than 10 times to get the message to send. Also I cant take as many pictures on this one than I can with my other Rumor Touch phone which can hold over 300 photes while this could only hold 100. Last thing, when I charge it the battery life symbol flashes low battery when its clearly not even pass one bar yet. However this quickly goes away in about a minute."	0

"Soy fan de Nokia, y esperaba ms de este telfono, su cmara no es buena, las fotos salen opacas y sin vida, el volumen multimedia es muy bajo, no se escucha muy bien las canciones, debieron mantener el reproductor de msica y de vdeo del Nokia N95 o del N73 o del N8 , como tambin la cmara del N8, en general debieron conservar muchas aplicaciones originales de Nokia, no se puede sincronizar con un dispositivo anterior para pasar informacin tales como contactos, realmente espero que en las actualizaciones de las apps hagan mejoras sobre las apps mencionadas arriba, otra cosa es que se calienta demasiado, no quiero pensar cmo ser cuando estemos en verano, espero no se malogre "	0

"Speed and reliability!    My wife has broken three phones for half a year - therefore I searched for something strong and thus modern - both on design, and under characteristics.    Motorola Defy - possesses all parameters of modern phone - gps, MULTITACH, the fast Internet and thus satisfies to the most strict standards of security (glass gorilla, underwater etc.)    My small daughter already has tried to play with new phone - only for this evening was somewhere from three falling.    I recommend this phone to those who conducts an active way of life and thus doesn&apos;t want to lag behind on equipment!"	1

"Sprint is going through a lot of changes since they have merged with Nextel, so I don&apos;t highly recommend the service right now.  However, I have had every service (Verizon, Cingular, T-Mobile) and now Sprint.  Verizon and Cingular have the worst customer service.  This phone is a great concept and is feature rich.  It is a good price considering all the features.  But, it is a bit awkward to hold; the flip phones are more comfortable.  I have actually dropped this phone several times because of its awkwardness.  I haven&apos;t been able to get the blue tooth headset to work (sold separately) and that was one of the main reasons I purchased this phone.  There is a different phone on my account that has an antenna and it gets better reception.  This phone needs some improvements and I do not recommend it."	0
sprint is removing nextel iden service. you should not plan on buying any nextel phones.when the nextel service is over i will move to pay as you go.	1

"STARTING TO THINK THIS IS A SCAM. i ordered this phone on the 18th and when it said delivered on the 22 all i got from the mail that day was gel foot inserts.. i contact usps, paypal, and ebay and they said they cant return any of my money because it says it was delivered on the 22...wtf? complete waste of money and time...never using usps again wasted almost 300$ for absolutely nothing. not even buyer resended or returned item."	0

"Still a bit of a 'green-horn' w/smartphones but, upon sage advice from a very smart younger friend, passed on buying a similar 'age' refurbished Apple I-4, instead going with this phone's 16 gig operating system, and more voluminous 'near-up to date' options.  Also, it's NOT a phone that is about to no longer be supported by the Manuf. like the I-4.  Does everything you'd want a near-state of art smartphone to do, from the camera functions, to expandable memory capabilities (put in a 32gig chip right away).  Has a Larger screen, larger keypad, etc. with LOTS to learn to utilize, apps not withstanding!!  It's not small, thin nor light but, who wants to deal with a smaller screen and tiny letters/numbers, especially as you get older. While not dirt cheap, a Refurbished (like nu) Samsung Galaxy Note2 is a GREAT phone for the cost!!!  Highly recommended!"	1
"Still can&apos;t write a review as of yet, still trying to solve an issue. We are working on a code to unlock the phone. However, when I receive my code, then take my cell phone back to Verizon for connection, I am sure I will be happy, but I cannot give a review until I receive a code from the seller."	0

"Super Fast internet/WIFI connection and so many more features to learn.  he Retina display on iPhone 4 is the sharpest, most vibrant, highest-resolution phone screen ever, with four times the pixel count of previous iPhone models. In fact, the pixel density is so high that the human eye is unable to distinguish individual pixels. Which makes text amazingly crisp and images stunningly sharp.  The periphery of this Apple smartphone is customized alloy, 5 times stronger than steel. Your accidental dropping will not hurt the worlds thinnest smartphone yet. The Retina Display packs in 4 times the amount of pixels (326 per inch) of iPhone 3, and makes the text and images slicing sharp. Add a 960 x 640 pixel screen and watching HD movies on this Apple smartphone becomes a gasp. When you become a shutterbug behind the iPhone 4 camera, you shoot 5 megapixel images and high-definition videos at 720p resolution, with the LED flash and autofocus making things easier. With Wi-Fi, the FaceTime feature of this 5-megapixel phone gets you into true worldwide video chat and staying in touch becomes real personal. And all it takes to choose between the front and rear camera on the iPhone 4 is a tap. The 3-axis gyro, when coupled with accelerometer, results in 6-axis motion sensing, and that is as good as it can ever get for gaming on a cell phone. With 7 hours of talk time (3G)/10 hours of video/40 hours of audio, this 5-megapixel phone packs in enough power to let you do fast multitasking and then some more  there are over a 100 new features thrown in."	1

"Super slow shipping. Took 9 days to arrive. The phone description read &quot;A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is applicable). Packaging should be the same as what is found in a retail store, unless the item is handmade or was packaged by the manufacturer in non-retail packaging, such as an unprinted box or plastic bag&quot;    This phone has clearly been used. The box it came it had clearly been opened. There was no protective plastic covering over the screen of the phone. And the kicker...there was still a photo saved on the phone. The phone has clearly been &quot;rooted&quot; or something like that. I am unable to download any applications. I feel incredibly ripped off. Hopefully Verizon can help me resolve any of these issues, although I&apos;m fairly certain the phone will have no warranty since it&apos;s been obviously tampered with."	0

"Terrible phone, worse than the one I had ten years ago.    Constantly unlocks itself in your pocket when walking or crossing your legs and pushes random buttons.    The side buttons are situated such that they get accidentally pushed all the time.  It often randomly starts the camera or activates the voice command tool and says &quot;Please wait...  Please say a command&quot; while holding the phone in your hand or in your pocket.    Annoying little ~2 second animation of a check-mark is displayed when you do stuff like after texting, setting the alarm, etc.    You can set the time to be displayed in 24-hour format but the alarm can only be set using the 12-hour format.    When the battery is low, it pops up a window warning you about it every time the phone unlocks.  You can&apos;t see the time or answer calls without spending 2-3 seconds to close the popup and watch the animation.    If you try to set the alarm to off in the form used to set the alarm, it warns that the alarm is off and ask if want to turn it on.    When sending a new text message, you can select the destination by typing the name of a contact.  If you enter a mistyped name or enter random letters, it still lets you create/send the message with no indication something was wrong."	0

"Terrible reception!  I transferred my number to this phone and it was activated but I could not make or receive calls or texts.  Whenever a call was made from the phone the call would end after numerous rings but never connect, apparently dropped.  I then attempted to place a call to the phone while still holding it in my hand from a cordless phone and again the call would not go through to the phone.   Talked to Tracfone and they told me that everything looked fine on their end and that it should be working.  I had three signal bars and no LTE signal.  I inadvertently discovered that inside my house that if it was not being held, in my hand, that it would work.  I then placed some calls with the phone on my desktop and when the person answered I asked them how I sounded to them and it was fine.  Then I picked the phone up during the call and the connection would break up and be dropped.  The same result every time.  Same result when receiving calls.   I then purchased a second one and had EXACTLY the same results.  Outside of my house it would work fine.  I have had many cellphones and used them inside my house with no issues but this model of Samsung was TERRIBLE.  Apparently holding the phone in my hand weakened the signal although the signal indicator showed no change.  I spo"	0

"Thank you very very much.  Great phone.   I&amp;apos;ll remember you Steve.  Thoughts: 3G vs. 3G S     1. The battery life for both is rather similar. SLIGHT improvement in the 3G S.   2. The LCD digitizer (touchscreen) is practically the same with both editions--3G seems brighter.   3. Dimensions and case sizes are nearly identical--3G S is a bit thinner. The engravings on the back are different, but you&amp;apos;re getting the same pretty case from the 3G.   4. Unaided GPS (without AT&amp;amp;T tower assistance) is just about as weak in both models... but the 3G S sports an internal compass, allowing for amazing accuracy and directional navigation while hiking and &amp;quot;street-walking&amp;quot;. Hands down, the best new addition to the 3G S.   5. The new CPU and graphics chip combine for SIGNIFICANTLY decreased loading times when partaking in both graphically intensive gaming, and everyday activities (web browser loading). In games, this contributes to increased frame rates which are highly noticeable.   6. The internal camera has been boosted from a paltry 2mp to an adequate 3mp. It&amp;apos;s not spectacular, but it&amp;apos;s in line with current offerings. It features autofocus, which is a very nice addition. FINALLY, users have built-in video recording capability without going to extreme lengths."	1

Otros telfonos que he tenido han sencillos mens y hacer que usted caractersticas importantes con facilidad. En general, me gustara recomendar el telfono si ests en un presupuesto."	1

With a GSM phone for the US customer you have two choices: ATT or t-Mobile.    AT&amp;amp;T does not like this phone.  It ran for about a half an hour and then AT&amp;amp;T kicked it off of their network after I sent my first text message. Oficially, this phone is not supported by AT&amp;T.    It seems to be fairing better with T-Mobile.  I wish their reception was better around here.    I saw someone write that this phone ignores SMS configuration messages issued by the network.  You will have to manually do the APN configuration.    Before buying this phone, one should go to the HTC user forums and observe the number of issues with this phone that go unanswered.    Common hardware complaints:  battery life, weak hinges.  I personally like the flip-out keyboard as opposed to the slide out keyboard.  I could be singing a different tune the first time I drop this phone.    Box was printed in english, quick start guide was chinese only.  There seems to be a lot of factory refurbished phones available for this particular model number.  Mine came with no SD card."	0
"The 2 Samsungs Galaxy S6 we bought said they were new but they are not. If you have issues with yours take it to a At&t store they can tell if it is refurbished by the numbers on the back.    NOT A HONEST Company AT ALL.  You need to change your description of these items, because they are not new. Caused our company a lot of issue sending our techs out into the field with cell phones that we thought were new and they do not work properly like a new cell phone. "	0
"The 401G is about as full featured as a non-smart phone can get: camera, short videos, messages to and from an email address, capture calls to contact list, speed dialing, limited speaker phone, usable keyboard, mp3 player, short message recorder.    My only complaint is that you can only turn speaker phone on when making a call, and then only during a short window.  I would and have recommended this phone to friends."	1
The 5S is a big milestone Apple made a big den in defined the smartphone market with hight market acceptance and the 5S truly went in history of human innovation in the direction of our ancestor. US the world leader in advance human quality of life . The 6 is now in replace the 5S in under developed countries 	1
"The 9330 blackberry works great.I was using a 8330 Curve, and wanted a blackberry that was newer with more options. The 9330 Curve has wi-fi, and has been easy to learn how to use."	1
"The actual cell phone is fine, except that when I went to register it at Jitterbug, they would not register it because they said it is obsolete and that model is not used any longer. Therefore,.... all I bought a piece of useless junk!"	0
"The ad banner states "" New LG G3 D850 Black GSM Unlocked Android 4G LTE 32GB 13MP Smartphone USA."" What it should say is ""Unlocked AT&T Phone."" This is an AT&T phone with apps that cannot be deleted. There are annoying pop-ups that have to be swiped away before you use the area you want. It does state AT&T apps in the description, however, it does not mention that they permanent. I took it to an AT&T store and they said that's the way it is. I also had to take it to my carrier who had to do a lot of changes just to get it to work. The only reason I did not give it a one star is that I wanted to upgrade from a 8GB to a 32GB in which it has. So, if you have AT&T service, good for you. However, if you don't, I would not get this phone."	0
The ad clearly stated 14 day delivery time. It took 20 days for this phone to arrive. Every time I checked shipping it was very vague. Whenever I contacted seller it was always a different person. They told me it would arrive by the 26th which was a Sunday. It did not arrive for four days after.	0
The ad is misleading.  I bought the phone and it requires a 6 month prepay card before activating with your carrier.	0
"The ad says the phone has WIFI...which I never found. Phone doesnt have Android, so maybe it does has wifi, but since I am not tech savvy and after trying to figure it out how to, I just gave it to my teen daughter that immediately said she doesn&apos;t want it....so the desting was the garbage can. Do not buy this cell if you want to have WIFI...It doesn&apos;t."	0
"THE ADD SAID , WORKING 10/10 ,AND IT IS NOT. PEN DOES NOT WORK."	0
"The add said that was a BRAND NEW LG VX9400 and it was not, was an used one.. I am very unhappy with this."	0
The advertising said excellent conditions and scrapes was scraping the accessories are fake	0
"The Android Operating System is outdated and after searching through 100&apos;s of posts: Microsoft rep ended thread regarding any possible upgrade by stating that he was closing out the discussion - Motorola&apos;s decision not to issue an update/upgrade to a newer operating system was final.  Most apps that I wanted to use on the phone werent available in the android market through the phone and after hours of searching for them to try and download them via my computer and then move to the phone, i realized they arent available through the phone because Android 1.6 or higher is required and this $300 paper weight is Android 1.5.  Thanks Motorola, and Boost Mobile too.  The Boost website made it seem as if this was the newest technology, but its been around for years and now Boost doesnt even show it on their site.  I swear, they pulled the ad as soon as I bought the stupid phone.  Matter of fact this is the stupidest smartphone out there."	0
The appearance of the phone was as described but the phone itself really doesnt work good. It freezes all the time. It doesn't connect to the internet well. Only thing that works is text and voice calls. Waste of my money 	0
The Apple 4S is a 3G phone. As of July 2018 Verizon will no longer activate any 3G phone and will discontinue service for them by the end of 2019. It has to be a 4G to be activated. I didn't know until I carried it to Verizon and the seller didn't know. He gladly gave me a full refund. 	0
"The Apple IPhone 6 is a really nice phone,lightweight, lots of features and easy to navigate through apps and pages. It is very user friendly."	1
"The apps shut down all the time,including the simple ones like text massaging."	0
"The ASUS zenfone 5. I think it&apos;s nice phone, the phone is very ergonomic, the quality is ten from ten. In my opinion, only capacity of battery is not enough. It works only two days. Everyone who are around me, likes it."	1
"The AX8600 is a great phone. It has a lot of the &quot;extra&quot; features such as camera, video, internet, TV, calculator, world clock, multiple alarms, etc... with out being overly fancy &amp; complicated (like the i-phone). I love the ultra-slim style of it- it is just as slim as a Moto-Razr, but without the raised bottom mouth-piece, which I find nice, because to me, at least, the raised bottom piece &amp; shortened &quot;clamshell&quot; of the razr is kinda annoying.     The one problem I have had with this phone is that the charging port on it seems to fail after a couple years or so of use, but other than that I&apos;d highly reccomend this phone"	1
The back cover of the phone doesn&apos;t stay on it keeps falling off. it came like that have to put tape on the back to keep the cover from coming off.	0
The back cover will not come off. I know press down and slide foward. This product should not have left Singapore.	0
the back would not come off .finally got it off and would not go back on  piece of junk	0
The baterydoesnt even last an hour. Realy bad battery 	0
The battery  does not last long but the pad battery makes up for that	1

"The battery dies in 2 hours for the first week, I had to keep charging, very inconvenient outside. Now it&apos;s worse,charging is on and off,battery dies in 30 mins."	0
the battery does last long and the speakers doesnt work properly.	0
The battery does not stay for long. The screen becomes non responsive for a while and the user satisfaction is poor	0
The battery doesn't last a while. It doesn't stand even four our with an internet connection. The product should be identified as used but they said 'new'. I'm really not satisfied. 	0
"The battery goes dead about 1/2 to 3/4 day. I have had several motorola phones the battery charge lasts all day but not this one. The phone did not come with a manual, or material needed to utilize the mp3 player. I would not buy this phone for any reason"	0
The battery has a serious issue.  Speaker doesnt work properly.   	0
"The battery in this cell phone is not new as it says, quickly discharged without any further conversation via mobile phone.Please send me a new battery"	0
The battery is bad and im trying to reach the seller to return it 	0
"The battery is in great shape which was surprising due to when I received the phone I inserted the charger to find the charging port was very worn out causing the charging cord to slip off. Eventually upon a full charge I initiated app down loads to find out after, the apps would shut down on their own, I am sure the motherboard has been damaged. Had the phone not have these two issues it would have been a good phone in working condition. Had the issues been listed properly I would not have paid the listed amount or would not have purchased this item. $15-25 would have been better for parts. I don't believe in returning products because of the waste of time thru mail. I will use this phone for parts. Advice; Know your product as well as you can and get it right the first time."	0
The battery is no good	0
The battery is not even working!! I have to keep it plugged in if I want to use it! Not worth anything!	0
"the battery is really bad without playing music,game,call, my battery only last for about 7houres and it is dead and the browser is not working i cant use my music as ring tone, video bad,camera very good,music sound good,but the internet is not working and that is a really big problem,by the way i am going for a blackberry bold.i can use a phone that i can not install application from pc. i can only install application only from my mobile internet that is very bad phone"	0

the battery lasts very little	0
"The battery life is good, ring volume is poor. This is phone has problems at the clam shell. Every phone like this I own wich is (4) out of all them only one has lasted. Each one broke at the hinge and samsung would not stand behind the product. Good luck with this type of phone!!!"	0
The battery life is very short.  I would expect it to last through one day without needing a charge.  It only lasts a partial day.	0
"The battery life on this phone lasts, well put it this way,  I haven't been able to use it yet til I get a new battery cause it doesn't even last thru the night if fully charged when go to bed.  The charger is not the right charger for this phone and so I need to get a new battery and a new charger.  I hope after that it works.  I should  have read more of the reviews than I did before I bought it:("	0
The battery lost power less than 10 hours after turn on ! Not even using it or make any phone calls . I have to keep charging it !  It is the worst cell phone I ve ever got !!!	0
The battery never held a charge. I have to have the phone plugged in to use it and then it gets dangerously hot. 	0
"The battery of the phone didn&apos;t last long even after charging for hours and hours. Now the battery won&apos;t charge at all! I would have the phone hooked to the charger and  try to turn on the phone. But after only being on for a second, the phone turns itself off again~!"	0
"The battery on this phone last a really long time. It also is pretty durable. My husband uses it for work because he can&apos;t have a camara phone. He has had it a year ans a half and it is still working good. He drops it all the time and has scratched it up pretty bad, but it still keeps working perfect. It picks up reception fairly well, too."	1
The battery packaged with the phone was flawed. Company sent replacement batter. Two months after phone recieved there was a pink line in the phone. Called customer care and the refused to help. Phone had problems since day 1 and company does not want to honor that they guarantee satisfaction. Don't buy from them you will be sad that you did. I tried to get results and to get help but they wouldn't help. They will steal your money and leave you will a bad product. Do not purchase.	0
The battery sucks at 100% charges it will be dead in 10 mins. Trying to reach seller to exchange or refund but having no luck yet. 	0
"The battery took several weeks of exercise charging to get up to standard but now seems to work well. I am old school and need a phone that secures in a leather case on my belt while horseback or a foot. So, this phone was bought to replace a like phone that got wet while crossing a river that I didn't think would go up over my waist ... oops. This is a great phone for men who need a phone to use for what a phone was intended to be used for. Great value for 20 dollars.  Karl Brauneis Lander, Wyoming  Feel free to edit."	1
The battery will not hold a charge for more than 5 mins. It was quick shipping but not happy with the phone at all. 	0
The beet phone for this price with good camera and it's very fast	1
"The BEST camera on cell phone. The WORST battery life in the world.  THE WORST, I PROMISE!  Mine is BLANK NEW. I use battery saver mode and LOW brightness, but I need to charge the phone TWO times a day just for accessing some internet and taking less than 30 photos(NO game and other heavy use at all.)   The camera is great but it requires huge energy."	0

The best phone i have had in relation price/quality	1
"The best phone I've had in years. I live out by a lake in Arkansas, and this phone was certainly the best reception I've had in a long time. and one of the best cameras."	1
The best phone that I have ever had and at a bargain price.  The sound is great and the images are very clear.  Takes beautiful pictures.  The phone is not too large but big enough to see the pictures and words on the screen clearly.  	1
The Best Smartphone Ever	1
"The best Windows Mobile on the market today! I can not desire anything more from a phone. Processor, memory, finger mouse - all these makes a pleasure to work with it."	1
"The bidding and transaction through Ebay was very smooth; however, this particular phone&apos;s home calling area was in Ohio and could not be changed.  Alltel was unable to upload the current PRL(preferred Roaming List) for my area and would not flash the phone because it was too old and they quit supporting it. So in using the phone Alltel would not wave any roaming charges that occurred. Oh well."	0
"The BlackBerry arrived today - Oct. 21 - It is actually in MINT condition! It took about 10 minutes for it to &quot;find&quot; its battery and begin to charge, but once it did - it was ready to take to Verizon and get set up. Very Happy with the purchase. Will probably get another one."	0
"The BlackBerry Curve 3G is a really nice phone, it comes with BlackBerry device software 5.0 out of the box, mine is the AT&amp;T unlocked version.    Phone is fast (624Mhz CPU) and multi-tasker, which means you can run many apps at the same time, for example you can surf the web while playing music, or download a file while watching a video. It has WiFi.     Internal Memory is about 160MB: 128MB for apps, 32MB for music, videos and documents. But you can expand that limitation with an microSD memory card.    Camera is a 2.0MP one without Flash, which maximum  resolution is 1600 x 1200 but they looks nice and can record video with sounds (only if you have a microSD inserted)    256MB RAM makes your device upgradable to blackberry device software 6.0 which means you&apos;ll be able to get the latest browser from RIM with HTML5 support.    It has: Full qwerty keyboard plus trackpad navigation, customizable conveniences keys on the side, and multimedia keys on the top for pausing, move to the next or to the previous music or video.      Overall this is a great phone for communicating, surfing the web, watch videos or listen an music. Nice design, great features, fast and GREAT.     Thanks, God bless."	1
The BlackBerry is by car the best smart phone out there.  Switching to android and the virtual and hands on keyboards provide options without being old fashioned.	1
the blackberry was in the condition that was stated. Also the information was very accurate and precise. Overall this was a good purchase.	1
"The bluetooth connection is lost on every call over 3 minutes, unlike all my other devices on that connection.   The keypad is frequently unresponsive to the touch."	0
The bought this product since I needed a phone. I thought it was a camera phone but it turned out not to be. It had great reception and long batttery life but  it stopped working after 3 days.	0
The box has better fuctionality than the phone does. I bought it for 80.00 and it was the worst 80.00 I ever spent. Now I cannot even sell it.	0
"The brightness of the monitor is not enough, the camera is very bad, It is first time I meet with such bad phone. Do all HAZELs so bad or I have bought worse one? I can not recommend to someone to buy such phone."	0
the buttons to small and especially hard to read numbers.the numbers on the screen have - thru them when they should not when dialing.when dialing a phone number it dials automatically before your done entering the numbers. not a great phone for the USA but can not tell you about out of country features.called up verizon with questions about the phone and they have very little info about the phone believe it or not.	0
The buyer says it unlocked but its locked I personally called Verizon and when u return the phone the buyer says its unlocked and charges 30 dollars restocking fee this is a scam 	0
"The buyer would not send my order out due to the payment not posting immediately in their PayPal account.Transaction was paid on my end. I kindly asked the seller to just cancel but he refused to cancel the transaction. He messaged me very rudely and said this is not his issue, why should he cancel. I&apos;m not going to pay. I will put a stop payment before this guy gets a red cent from me. So why be that pressed for a sale and probably will have to do a dispute later on. To cancel the transaction would be more painless. Smh"	0
The call reception is great compared to my previous phone.  I get 3 bars where my old phone was lucky to have 1.	1
"the camera does not work well, vibrates when it starts, it is a factory error."	0
The camera has a purple tint and seller did not wright it on the description. Will not buy from this seller again	0
"the camera is supposed to be one of the best, but it sucks, It keeps dropping calls, When I take a picture it always takes two instead of just one in different formats wasting my time.  when I hook it up to the computer I have to keep messing with it to get my computer to recognize it.  I don't have this problem with any other external devices so it's not my computer.  I have tried it on two differerent computers and still have to mess with it to get the computer to recognize it.  I will never by another one.  This is my second one, I bought this one because I thought maybe the other one was just broken or something, but this one is doing the same thing.  Also, I don't know what a small form factor is."	0
The camera sucks on this piece of crap and it randomly shuts off on me all the time i hate this phone as far as im concerned androids period suck !!!	0
The camera's pixel quality on this phone is unacceptable. It is virtually useless to take a good picture. The phone functions are fine but because the lack of camera ability I need to buy another phone. Very disappointing.  	0

"The cell phone works very well, but it has a lot of scratches on the screen and this looks very bad."	0
"The cell phones I bought from this seller are blocked, plus the batteries and the chargers don't function properly either. I found this incredible that these people (sellers) are talking advantage by selling us (customers) useless items and charging us as if the money came to our hands without any effort. In addition to that, the seller stated that these phones were compatible with Metro PCS, AT&T and T- Mobile. That's completely false. Please, have more respect for the costumers. Im very disappointed with this purchase. Thank you. "	0

The company send our phone quickly and in excellent condition.  They also were extremely flexible when we wanted to return it and try a new phone (which we are keeping)...  Great experience!	1
The company who sold this Nokia 521 a big cheater the cell phone work few days only than its dead thats it so I have throw them in trash.	0
The controls/buttons are TERRIBLE.. the keypad in flush and not beveled or raised enough so you have to really watch where your finger are and if the numbers pressed show up on the screen..  the circle disk on the front does spin or depress and you cant tell if you are actually using it...     Very frustrating and time consuming to use.. The next version of the chocolate VX9550 is WAY better..	0
the cover is terrible the back cover never close all the phone look like they found it in junk .  i can&apos;t return it because they don&apos;t allow that	0
The cracks are terrible and didn't show in the the seller's first post of the product before I bought it. 	0

The description is 4G of RAM but has only 1.5G of RAM.	0
The description of the article was false.	0
The description of the phone stated it had a clear screen and good battery life that would last all day. Well there was two apparent light burn in marks on the screen when lit. Also once the battery is at 50% or less it randomly powers down.	0
"The Description of this product was not truthful. He said that it was in good condition, however it was not. When I received the phone it was brown stuff all in the key pad ear wax all in the ear piece some more brown stuff in places that I can even describe. After requesting for a return he told me that my return was not approve and that I should try to sell it again. I would not do to somebody what they have done to me. That would not be the Godly thing for me to do. Do not believe the descriptions the this seller says."	0
The description reads BRAND NEW Motorola Moto G4 Play US Cellular Smartphone Black. Condition is Used.   Over?	0
"The description said it was unlocked, but it won't work on Verizion. It would be wise to put that fact in the item description."	0
The description said that the phone was in excellent condition. The phone works fine the the phone was in bad shape!!	0
The description says it supports 4G but I'm only getting 2G on home WiFi and data plan.  Whereas my other phone gets 4G on home WiFi..... Misleading description.	0

Great seller, awesome shipping time,  fantastic description of the product!! A+"	1

The device did not  come the day it said it would come and i feel highly pissed and lied too.. 	0
"The device is amazing, and when you combine that with excellent customer service this seller provides, you will really enjoy what you getting for your money, this seller is great and I'd recommend him, device is as described, definite five star rating"	1

"The device was reported stolen or missing  I was not able to activate,  EMBARRASSING "	0
The device you sent me is not working properly. I informed you in the past and did not answer me. It's really a theft to sell a broken device! I ask for my money back. I will post your service in a special post to prevent additional nesters from losing their money.	0
The digitizer seemed off. Bad response. I returned it for a refund	0
"The display on this phone only lasted about a week.     The reception is OK, not great. Battery life is just average.    Really not a very well made phone."	0
"The dive didnot regestier with the network &amp; had more comestic damage than stated in the descripton. Also I had to pay to have the phone replaced. This should not be, if someone is selling an item on ebay, they need to make sure they give accurate information, that could cause problems for ebay."	0

"The droid x is a pretty solid phone. The touchscreen is super responsive and the physical command buttons are so much  better than the touch buttons compared to the other droids. The froyo update speeds the phone to a speed of +1.3ghz mine at 1.35ghz =D make this phone one of the fastest phone out there. Call quality, nice. Camera, beautiful. Web browsing excellent. Oh and for texting, the swype feature is pretty neat :) The only down side for this phone is probably the battery life, but what can you expect with a phone with a HUGE screen :) As for the accessories, i have the docking station and the car dock. The Docking station looks pretty nice and when you connect to it, it has a special &quot;page&quot;?? i guess you could say that is unique and perfect for an alarm clock/charger. The car dock is a must if you use your google navigation for the phone! Its alot better than driving with one hand and holding your phone in the other (is what i used to do) but the car dock is a bit bulky compared to the other droid docks btw. Overall im pretty happy with the phone, performance-wise and call quality (i mean it is a phone right ? :) and i would recommend this to anyone else looking for a smartphone"	1
The dude sold me what was supposed to be a new phone but found out I can not even use the phone because it already has a open account and the seller refuse to have the phone disconnected so I can actually use the phone so 150 down the drain so beware	0
"The ear piece does not work on the phone, the battery does not last and the Mophie case does not work.  ( I wasnt even worried about the case, but you cant even make a call on the phone because you cant hear) I was told to return the phone to ""Boost"" by the seller. Not even sure what this means or how to do this and never got a response about it."	0
The edges are all cut and the cell is in poor conditions .Should not be selling this at all .Not even for parts !	0
"The entire order wasn&apos;t anything was describe it.  But i did recice it on time , and the custmer service dealing wih the return issue was good."	0
"The ESN/MEID checked clean, it is clean anywhere online but not financially eligible.  Meaning whoever was the PREVIOUS owner, which doesn&apos;t make sense because it was labeled new, still has unpaid bills for this phone in their account.  Phone is not verifiable anywhere."	0
The Excellent seller! The Excellent product! is it quickly put(deliver)ed!	1
The face of the phone was held together using double sided tape. The phone was not new or &quot;mint &quot; condition at all. He did refund my money.	0
"the fact that its a old school phone and i was able to find it on you auction site. i personaly like the phone, nobody today has it.  the phone was in excellent condition and the price was too hard to pass, good pricing. wish some would do for the newer phones."	1
the features on the phone are excellent.  it is the phone itself that has a MAJOR problem.  it keeps freezing up.  it shuts off at the wrong times.  other than that it is good.  i purchased this phone because of the low cost and the apps that i wanted to maintain my daily life.  this product would be excellent if it weren&apos;t for the screen freezing up and the phone shutting off.	0
The Fire Phone is a great GSM phone and even without the year of prime service it is worth the $150 current average price.  It is a bit heavier than my old AT&T phone but when you consider it's features it is well worth the few oz. increase.	1
The first I bought fine. The last one .	0
"The first one was defective and unable to program. The second one kept dropping calls constantly and I could not make or receive calls at times. I returned both. Not worth the time, money, frustration ."	0
"The first phone I received the phone, it would not charge.  It was the connection of the charger to the phone that was loose.  I believe this was obvious, and should have never been sold.  So, I returned it, costing me 3.79 postage.  They replaced it with a second phone that would not accept the US Cellular programming.  That was not obvious, so not their fault.  I retured it, and refused a preplacement. I spent another 3.79 postage returning that phone.  So, the orginal 14.50 postage they charged me, plus the 7.58 that I spent, my total was $22.08, and I still don&apos;t have a phone.  I spent all that money for nothing.  The only good news was that they let me return it without a restocking charge."	0
"The first phone, it didn&apos;t charge and the second phone I now have cuts out when you are talking to someone and they can&apos;t hear everything and you can&apos;t hear everything and I would like my money back but don&apos;t know how to go about that! I am very disappointed in the product.  This is my first purchase and if this doesn&apos;t work out I won&apos;t purchase anything else again. If a product doesn&apos;t work, I shouls be able to send it back at no charge and get my money back!"	0
"The first Samsung SGH my daughter had was excellent.  We purchased it from AT&amp;T.  After it fell into the pool this summer, we purchased this one for her on eBay.  I usually have excellent purchasing experiences on eBay, but not this time.  The phone did not work at all.  When I tried to work it out with the seller, he refused to refund my money or even try to work something out.  Lesson - watch who you buy from.  Even if they have excellent ratings, email them to make sure you can return it if it doesn&apos;t work.  &quot;As is&quot; doesn&apos;t necessarily mean just wear and tear."	0
"the first thing i saw the phone i bought from ebay , i just want to throw away ( because the phone too old ,with nothing go with that phone even the phone charge , so too expensive for that phone ,compare with $290 i had spent for )everything on phone working , but the seller said it 3gs phone ,but the phone it 3g .but  i think i never buy everything from ebay again , because i don&apos;t have experiment (maybe),"	0
"the first thing what  i do when i want buy something is check the feedback, and this significant a very responsible person.About the article it was in perfectly condition."	1
"The first time I used the phone the person I called could not hear what I said.  After putting the phone on speaker they could hear me but with a bad echo.  The speaker could not be activated.  When I took it to the AT&T store the repairman said it was a reworked phone, not new.  Otherwise the other phone features worked fine.  But with no speaker, what good is a phone?"	0
"The first windows phone I ever bought and the Last one,  I trade it for a new one after less than a month. I can recommend this to anyone....  The worst phone "	0
The flip part of the phone broke almost immediately. The wear and tear on the phone was extreme.  It was a waste of money!!!	0

the functions of the phone worked well but would not stay connected to mobile network so I ended buying another phone	0
"The galaxy is an amazing piece of hardware. I&apos;ve been an Apple Fanboy for quite a long time but the change was seamless. I&apos;m also a techy kind of guy, so any device that gives me the freedom to do what I want is always a plus. It&apos;s alittle daunting at first, so many options to play with and configure, but once you get the hang of the OS, anything is possible. Ok time to get back to Super Mario World. *wink*"	1
The galaxy s6 I bought arrived a day early and in better condition than the pictures made it out to be. Im very pleased with it and would definitely buy from this seller again based on my experience with this purchase. 	1
The good - Long battery life and it feels indestructible.    The rest:    Phone has almost no internal storage.  Any apps that can&apos;t be installed to a micro SD card and still work you will have to live without.    The phone is incapable of connecting to the 3G network with wind mobile despite advertising that it connects to the 1700/2100 bands.  If you want to be able to use your data don&apos;t bother.    Even purchasing this as a temporary back up wasn&apos;t really worth it for us - wish we&apos;d spent an extra $80 and got something that would at least support Data.	0
"The good thing about this seller is that they are willing to work with you and help you in any way that they can.  The seller will respond to your questions in a timely manner.  However this product didn't work for me, but I rather have a product that's not for me than to have a product and a seller that not good.  I think it's just this phone that's not for me for some reason.  Other than that I did enjoy working with the seller."	1
"The Good:    The Nokia N93 is equipped with a 3.2-megapixel camera with video-recording capabilities, and it features a cool, swivel design. This Symbian smart phone includes Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, a music player and FM radio, and e-mail capabilities.       The Bad:    The Nokia N93 is clunky and heavy, making it awkward to use as a phone. Call quality was mixed in our tests, and the external display is small.       The Bottom Line:     Though it won&apos;t replace your digital camcorder or camera, the powerful Nokia N93 does a respectable job of integrating quality multimedia capabilities into a cell phone. That said, it&apos;s a bulky handset and is best suited for convergence fanatics and gadget hounds."	0
"The Good: With the UTStarcom GTX75 Quickfire, you get the luxury of a touch screen along with the convenience of a QWERTY keyboard at an affordable price.    The Bad: The touch screen is not perfect and in some instances can be hard to use. The camera quality is not great. And most importantly, this phone works best with AT&amp;T. I bought an unlocked version of this phone and used it with T-Mobile. The incoming text message sender id does not show. This might be an error that originated from the unlocking process. I recommend this phone ONLY to AT&amp;T users."	0

the GPS signal on this phone sucks	0
"the gusto 3 is very similar to the gusto 2,,,, a little thinner and the buttons on the sides have stronger springs or are recessed more so you do not turn on speakerphone or activate the camera when answering a call....The Gusto 2 was A PAIN from the beginning -- my answer was to purchase a case for the 2 and that helped a lot...However the case will not fit the gusto 3.   Do not need it anyway!!  Battery life is good on both phones, the 3 shows 3 bars and then 2 bars of battery left, but I can go 3 or 4 days before I have to charge battery.. Battery lasts 7-9 days...I do not use the phone for anything other than making/receiving calls, approx. 600-650 min./month.."	1

"The HTC Desire, once rooted, has all of the pros from the Nexus One, without the cons.  The Nexus One&apos;s haphazard touchscreen issues didn&apos;t carry over, and the always-annoying capacitive-touch buttons are swapped out with hardware buttons, making my life much easier.  Gone are the days of trying to watch a video or play a game and accidentally backing out of the application with a misplaced grip.  The phone really shines with a leaked version of Gingerbread."	1
"The HTC Evo is amazing. it&apos;s super-fast and very powerful. plus it has all sorts of apps.    the only drawback is the batter life, which isn&apos;t that great."	1
The HTC Fuze is the best smartphone out there right now and very user friendly. The phone was in excellent condition. Great product. Definitely reccommended!	1
the HTC myTouch 3G (T-Mobile)  is a excellent phone and recommed it to anyone who is looking for a phone like the iphone but for tmoible with the endless mount of apps and and it camara is good too. overall tis phone is really good.	1
"The HTC phones are the best phones around. They have the features, and capabilities that all of the other phones have as well, but HTC has a better interface and menu options within the messaging applications.   However, beware of Verizon ""unlocked"" phones. Because Verizon is primarily a CDMA carrier, these phones will always look for a CDMA tower before a GSM tower to connect for voice operations. You will have to manually add the proper APN settings, and even then voice and data connectivity are not reliable."	0

"The iPhone 3G is the second generation of iPhone. It was the successor to the original iPhone, and is succeeded by the iPhone 3GS. Introduced on June 9, 2008 at the WWDC 2008 at the Moscone Center, San Francisco. The 3G was very similar to its predecessor, containing the same 2 MP camera and no support for video recording, and its performance was limited by the same 128 MB eDRAM memory unit.[10] Nevertheless, the 3G featured several improvements over the original. It supported Assisted GPS, 3G data and Tri-band UMTS/HSDPA."	1
the iphone 3gs is amazing. I had the iphone 3g and updated to the 3gs because of the extra things it does.The 3gs is easy to use and has lots of space for pics movies and other apps. The clarity with calls is very good.the seller sent it in a timely manner at a good price. I love Ebay!	1
"The iPhone 4 is no small thing to review. As most readers of Engadget are well aware, in the gadget world a new piece of Apple hardware is a major event, preceded by rumors, speculation, an over-the-top announcement, and finally days, weeks, or months of anticipation from an ever-widening fan base."	1
"The iPhone 4 is the culmination of years of refining Apple&apos;s iPhone line of products.One by one, Apple has improved features and the latest iteration enhances a number of important elements like display, camera (with Flash), dual-microphone, larger battery and multi-tasking - just to cite a few.The design itself has been updated to use steel and aluminosilicate glass, which is ultra-resistant to scratches (but not shocks). The new antenna design has been generating a ton of controversy recently because of interferences caused by the contact between the user&apos;s hand and the phone itself. So, how bad is it? I will tell you what works and what doesn&apos;t, without sugar-coating or politics."	1
"The iPhone 4 is the ultimate upgrade to the iPhone line.    What else could they possibly add in an upgrade?    I&apos;ve owned each iPhone from day 1 of their launch dates.    (Please also read my reviews of the iPhone 1.0, 3G, &amp; 3Gs)     I&apos;ve owned a cellphone since 1992. I&apos;ve always had a &quot;top of the line phone&quot; (I&apos;ve always had AT&amp;T = formerly Cingular = formerly BellSouth Mobility)     In 17 years having cellphones, I&apos;ve had over 100 (Yes 100+) different models &amp; makes.    I&apos;ve also had a few days each with the Palm Pre and Motorola Droid - neither compare to the iPhone 4.    The screen on the new iPhone 4 (also known as the iPhone HD) has to be seen to be believed. One hing that not many people are saying about the iPhone is that the screen seems to be a part of the glass not slightly recessed behind a piece of glass.    Besides the screen that&apos;s been compared to a high end laser printer for text, the new iPhone has a new button arrangement that are easier to press and understand their functionality.    The iPhone 4 also has a new antenna that delivers almost twice the performance for cell signal, bluetooth, and wifi. The casing IS the antenna!    The wifi signal has been boosted from 802.11g to 802.11n - greatly extending the range, security, and bandwidth of the signal.    The new camera on the iPhone 4 bumps up from the 2 megapixel on the original iPhone and bumps up from the 3 megapixel on the iPhone 3Gs. (Original and 3G shared the same camera &amp; processor)    I had an original Apple Quicktake camera and it was amazing even though it was below a megapixel - when Apple discontinued cameras in 1998 I longed for the day when they would again create a camera using their expertise. With the iPhone that happened - with the iPhone 4 the perfect camera now exists! A camera that can instantly share a picture or video on the internet, thru email, or save for later. A camera that has ON device editing - even through Photoshop using the Adobe Photoshop app.    The iPhone 4 also adds a front facing camera which allows you to video conference with other iPhone 4 users.    The iPhone 4 also brings a new operating system (to all iPhones) and multiple application use (multitasking) to the 3GS and iPad, and iPhone 4.    The iPhone 4 uses GSM - an international standard technology for cellphones.     Verizon &amp; Sprint use CDMA (&amp; variants) - this technology is found in very few places widespread outside the USA &amp; Europe.    While the iPhone 4 also has better GPS functionality - the Google maps app is decent but not the best - but the best app for GPS certainly got better with the better antenna and the new accelerometer/gyroscope in the iPhone 4 - try Navigon - it ROCKS!    Because an iPhone uses standard iPod sync &amp; charge cables, accessories are easy to find.     Battery life is very good &amp; improved from the previous generations of iPhones; even when utilizing power draining features like Wifi &amp; Bluetooth.     I can actually use the calculator on an iPhone, unlike on other cell phones where you have to figure out corresponding keys.    I have a lot of music nearly 2000 songs and a GPS app that takes up almost a gigabyte, plus nearly 1000 pictures on my iPhone and the 16GB model is perfect for me - leaving me with 4 gigs of space left.    I now have zero complaints about the iPhone 4. My complaints are relegated to AT&amp;T!"	1
"The Iphone 4S, I purchased cannot be used as it was intended because it had a bad IMEI Number and could not be activated. Therefore, I cannot rate the product."	0
The iPhone 5c works like a charm.. fast shipping and great price! A+ service	1
"The IPhone 6 I purchased was suppose to be new and unlocked. Neither were true. It came in a random box that had a different id number than the phone. I couldn't use it because it was locked, so it was returned. "	0
"The iPhone 6/64GB was bought from DTech based in Miami. They claimed it was a new phone. Even though the price was a very good $230 including shipping, it was a USED phone.  As soon as it was received battery did not charge fully and phone would shut off immediately. Took it to an Apple store the next day and the diagnostics revealed that it was a phone bought in Japan with no battery life left that had been charged in excess of 800 times. It came with a fictitious plug/charger and earphones, all packaged to make it look new.  I ended up buying a new battery. If they are going to sell a product claiming that it is new, and switch it for a used phone of dubious origins they need to say it...That is called BAIT & SWITCH. I will never know if this was a stolen phone passed as new."	0
The iPhone 6s Plus is awesome! It has a bigger battery than the 6s which means longer battery life. It's has awesome resolution & the camera is awesome! Way better than the iPhone 7! 	1
"The IPhone 7, Verizon unlocked phone came, not in the box as represented, but rather, wrapped in packaging instead.  The phone was not unlocked but locked.  Bad, Bad. It is un-useable to me. "	0
The iphone arrived Icloud locked. I try to contact the seller and dindt answer me	0
"the iPhone did not work, the batt went dead the 2nd day and would not recharge, apparently the phone was not meant to work in the USA. as phone calls could not be made, this was even after another sims card was installed by AT&T.   ebay did have the money refunded to paypal account.  do not buy this iPhone unless you want one that does not work"	0
"The iPhone home bottom didn't work only with Bluetooth on, and when you set up the Bluetooth on then the key board doesn't work, and when you set up the key board as the seller says then the home bottom stop working. Seller staying to reset the phone in order for both to work this in particular didn't do the trick.   Item return due to those reasons, the rest is good a very good conditions and a very good price."	0
"The iPhone I recently purchased was not good from the start. As soon as I got it, I realized that the battery of the phone would die off really quick, within minutes of using it; it would have about 80% of charge and less than 5 minutee it would say it has about 1% left. Then after 3 weeks of hassling with the phone rying to keep it carged, it competely turnd off and died. We had it charging over night but when we checked up on it the following mornig, it still said it was dead. We tried 5 diffrent charges to ry to get it charged, but it charge. It's been a week since it turnd off and to ths day it still has not turnd on."	0
"The iphone is a revolutionary phone and is so simple and easy to use that you&apos;ll never want to go back to using a standard phone. True, there are many touchscreens out there but this by farrrr out does them all."	1
The iPhone is great no problems. Hopefully never problems. Great seller communicate on time.	1

"The iPhone itself was in excellent condition.However,the phone is still activated under someone else&apos;s name.Its clear to me that I may have a stolen product.Very unprofessional from the sellers.Very dissapointed."	0
The iPhone screen was good but the lens on the camera came chipped cant even us the phone for any thing hope this was helpful for any one thinking of purchasing this item if there is a activation lock on it he probably stole it	0

The iphone was well packaged and arrived in a timely manner. It was in new condition and operated perfectly.	1
"The iPhone X is the newest generation of iPhone, and it feels like it. Love it already!"	1
"The issues I'm having are fixable from what I have read and I did not recognize anything as a problem until after 30 days so no warranty. The phone was listed as having an operating system that was ""clean"" and ready for an AT&T customer.  They failed to mention it used to be on Verizon, that whoever is responsible for making the operating system ""clean"" is very poor at doing so, and that there would be kernels of the last company and customer who used it embedded throughout the operating system and setup. Now it has stopped sending texts with attachments, an annoying pop up stating ""SIM card not Verizon"" started showing up EVERY TIME I PICK IT UP., and it won't sync correctly. The phone was physically just as described, very nice and well kept, and priced right. But if you fail to mention the problems one may encounter based on the phones history and the buyer writes a review prior to really using it every day and discovering issues then everything looks just great to the next guy in line. I am sick and tired of people putting dishonest descriptions and hiding the real reasons an item is well priced. If honesty is an issue with you then find a job based on deceit and stay away from the honest mans world, we don't need you and don't want you."	0
The ist phone(the original i purchased) did not work.  the phone had a broken button and deleted phone numbers from my contact list.  the second phone can not keep a charge.  i have replaced the battery twice by purchasing new batteries.

"the item was not a described by the seller, it was not dual sim card and was not unlocked"	0
The item was not as described. It was stated that the sale was for a motorola devour and a free bluetooth headset.  Received the phone in excellent condition however there was no headset sent in the package. Shipping was a little slow(Shipped approx. 5 business days after payment was cleared).  Very happy with the condition of the phone but unhappy that I did not receive the headset as stated in the listing.	0

"The item was unclearly described for sellers, that the item cant be used with a sim card, and should be used for carrier like verizon.For me i was disconted with the presentation. .Disgusting experience foe an avid ebay seller like me. Buyer should include this statement based on buyer&apos;s email response:    &quot;You can not use the phone via a sim Card. The phone was original set up for use with verizon. This carrier does not utilize sim cards. Therefore it would have to be used with a carrier similar to verizon. Unlocked means it can be used with multiple cell phone PROVIDERS THAT SHARE THIS SIMILARITY WITH VERIZON &quot;"	0
"THE ITEM YOU SENT DOES NOT MATCH YOUR LISTING YOU DESCRIBED.  YOU STATED THAT THIS WAS ONLY USED A COUPLE OF DAYS.  THIS PHONE HAS BEEN USED A LONG TIME THE CHARGER DOESN&apos;T STAY CONNECTED LONG ENOUGH SO IT CAN CHARGE.  THE CASE IS SCRATCHED ON THE SIDES FRONT AND BACK.  THE METAL JACKS ON THE SIDES HAVE BEEN WORN SO MUCH THAT THEY ARE BENT.  THE PHONE DOES NOT WORK WITHOUT TURNING ITSELF OFF AFTER ONLY A COUPLE OF MINUTES; WHEN THE PHONE IS DEFECTIVE, I CAN&apos;T ACCESS THE PHONE BECAUSE IS LOCKED BY THE SUBSITY PASSCODE AND OR IT TURNS OFF AFTER ONLY A MINUTE OR TWO.  EITHER YOU MISINFORMED US IN THE ITEM DISCRIPTION OR YOU SENT ME A HORRIBLY USED PHONE BY MISTAKE.  EITHER WAY JUST REFUND ME MY MONEY ALONG WITH THE SHIPPING.  I AM MORE THAN HAPPY TO SEND YOU BACK THIS PHONE IF YOU INCLUDE THE SHIPPING FOR THE RETURN AS WELL.  OTHERWISE I CAN HEAVE IT IF YOU LIKE.  THANKS FOR RESPONDING QUICKLY IN ADVANCE."	0
The K1 has lots of extras to make it an all-in-one.  The ability to add a mini SD card allows more versatility.  Good size and presentation of information but screen is a little small and cramps some info.  Good camera.	1
The key pad is easy to use and it takes great pictures. I bought it because I previously had the same model phone and dropped it in water. I went back to the store to purchase another one and found out they no longer sell that model. That&apos;s when I went on e-bay looking for the same model I had.	1
"the keyboard buttons need to much pressure, the home and back keys are not very responsive either. The phone does everything its supposed to, just doesn&apos;t feel like a quality product.  I have a Huawei u8800 that this phone was to replace. I prefer the Huawei over this."	0
"The keypad freezes up all the time even on a brand new model, slow downloads, I is easy to use. I find myself resend text messages constantly."	0
"The keys get stuck all the time, The phone is two diferent colors, from the moment I opened the box I realized is NOT a new phone."	0

"The LG C195 Silver Unlocked GSM Quadband Qwerty WiFi cellular phone was defective when I received it. One of the keys would register sometimes only if pressed repeatedly, and sometimes not at all. When I contacted the vendor about this defect, I was instructed by the vendor to mall the cell phone back to the vendor at my expense. The vendor added that only after they had received the returned cell phone, would they would mail me another similar cell phone. Upon considering the expense of mailing the cell phone back, the indeterminate waiting period during which I would have no telephone at al, and the chance the the replacement unit might be as defective as the first one I had purchased, I decided to cut my losses, dispose of the defective LG C195, and get a new cell phone from another vendor."	0
"The LG CU515 offers a simple, user-friendly design, decent call quality, and a solid feature set that includes 3.5G support, Push to Talk, stereo Bluetooth, and world phone capability.   The LG CU515 has a disappointing external display and it lacks a camera flash and voice dialing. Photo and streaming video quality were uneven.  The LG CU515 is great for making calls, but it&apos;s not AT&amp;T&apos;s best cell phone for multimedia and wireless broadband use"	1
"The LG G3 is not exactly a ""small"" form factor, width-wise, but neither is it uncomfortable in my petite wife's hand. The phone is actually quite light, especially for the overall size. The battery never run's down. We bought an extra battery and stand charger in anticipation, but have only swapped batteries once, after a long day-and-a-half without a charge and with slightly over-average use. The phone has exceptionally clear communication."	1
the LG is easy to use it&apos;s a good phone i would recommend anyone to buy it i love this i don&apos;t have no problem with it so if anyone out there need a simple nice phone to use you can buy the LG Optimus F6 MS500 4G Phone	1
The lg mytouch is a nice looking phone just not for me its a little on the slower side but other then that a very nice looking phone.	1
"The LG Quantum is a Windows Phone 7 powered smartphone. It&apos;s main selling point was the fact it was the first WP7 Powered device to sport a full physical QWERTY keyboard, and the keyboard is quite good, sans for the awkward placement of the shift and fn keys.    The screen is bright and legible and the quality of construction is very high, but not to the expectation of some Nokia and HTC lovers. The keys of the keyboard are very wide and nicely spaced and typing is generally quite nice, although WP7 is not quite optimized for landscape use just yet as some apps won&apos;t shift to landscape even if the keyboard is open, and you find yourself turning the device left and right a lot while trying to enter data into some fields.    Battery life is very good for a device of this caliber and performance is spectacular. You can really see this whilst scrolling or using the multi-touch zoom gestures. WP7 is very polished and is as smooth if not more, than iOS.    The price on contract is very reasonable as is the price off contract. If you are looking for a keyboarded WP7 powered device, then this may be the phone you are looking for. You may also want to look at the Dell Venue Pro or the HTC Pro 7 if you are considering other keyboarded WP7 alternatives, but the price point of this phone compared to others simply cannot be beat.    If you are looking for a slim keyboard-less WP7 device, then I highly recommend the HTC HD7s or Samsung Focus.    Windows Phone 7 has a definite future in the smartphone world and the closed eco-system of requirements that Microsoft demands will only make the system stronger. It is much like having iOS, all of the applications will work with every phone due to the minimum requirements and there will be no segregation like with Android, hence the lack of large or graphic intensive games in the Android Market (There is another flaw with that due to storage, but that if for another time).    Developers can easy port applications to the quality of the iOS App Store and every WP7 user can use them. Just like the iPhone, it would just work, only, you could pick a phone from your manufacture of choice and your model to suit your preference instead of only being given &apos;one&apos; option."	1
"The lg stylo 2 plus is supposed to be lg's version of Samsung galaxy note 3. How ever the plus isn't mil compatible, can't connect to TV with mil cord  and has a very low speaker, speakerphone for all your listening needs, maps music it's very poor.I just replaced this phone for with a Note 4 The note 4 is mil compatible and has loud speaker, speaker phone .It also has ir blaster for remote controls.

"The lg viewty smart gc900 look great..I have used it less than a month, now the phone is froze..touchscreen is not working anymore..wasted my money. almost $300 gone. Thanks a lot."	0
The light on the front when the phone is closed blinks constantly ever since I got it. And when I open the phone it takes about two minutes before the screen comes on. The company I bought it from was helpful when I emailed about the problem and they told me to send the phone back for repair. But I haven&apos;t. I don&apos;t have time for the hassle. I will wait until I renew my service and get a better phone then. The phone sucks. Even $40 was too much to spend in my opinion.	0
The listing seems to be fraud. Ordered  on 8th April still no delivery. No tracking. No replies from seller inspite of repeated emails asking for an update. Not even once. Seems I will need to open a dispute to get my money back. Don't buy from this seller. Not a good shoping experience.	0
"The looks were good, but there where a few problems. I was said that there would only be a couple of scatches, but tech workings where like new.   Not so, the camara only worked with it felt like it. I tried many times in a day then one date it worked and if I didnt take most of the picture that day, who knows with it would work again. When you set the call alart to vibrate, you can not see anything on the screen. You have to turn it off and on sometimes after the vibaiton ring for the cell to act right. Just the looks is what it has goin for it."	0
"The Lumia 950 is great phone, especially for the prices they're going for now.  Best in class camera with 4K video, zippy processor, super crisp screen with the latest Gorilla Glass, and it works seamlessly with all my other Microsoft products (Surface Pro, Windows 10 laptop, Invoke Cortana speaker).  I've read complaints about the plastic back Microsoft chose to use for the Lumia 950 but it provides easy access to the battery which can be easily swapped out and to a micro SD card slot which allows you to greatly increase the storage space on the phone.  Wireless charging out of the box and compatible with any Qi inductive charger, I have one at work and several throughout the house so I can easily top off the battery wherever I am.  Most people are going to put a case on the phone anyway so the plastic back doesn't really matter.  I also read lots of complaints about the lack of apps but most of the things I need to do I can do through the Edge browser and mobile ready sites, which most sites utilize.  I can access my smart home products through Samsung SmartThings and the EcoBee app, I can pin my favorite albums and podcasts to the main screen with Live Tiles to tell me when new episodes are available, and I can arrange the tiles in any size or configuration I want just like I "	1
"The main problem with this product was network. Although it is meant to be usable outside USA unlocked, but it had given me a terrible experience in its searching for network, totally unreliable. I was lucky to have obtained grab the network once or twice."	0
"The main reason for purchasing this product was because my dad needed a new phone. It was not one of the very latest however it had the necessary and &quot;bonus&quot; features; speakerpone, a mini lcd (that shows who&apos;s calling w/o  picking up the phone) web&amp; smart texting capabilities... I alsolike this phone because of its sleek look and variety of colors."	1
"The Meizu M8SE is a quality smartphone. Everything about it is great: sound quality, overall multimedia capabilities, web browser, app store, optional installation of Android, build quality, accessories, battery life, etc. Plus, there&apos;s a great community behind it. Honestly the best smartphone I&apos;ve ever used, and more than worth the price."	1

"The moment of first use (of course after charging it up to 100%), the battery life dramatically dropped. Less than an hour had gone by and it was already 70-75%... it had major heating problems too... was very disappointed.. I was hoping I didnt have to return it.. but this phones battery life and heating up was worse than my original phone!    Can't complain too much cause the return policy wasnt too bad. Thats why I give this a 2 star.  Phone itself 1star. But the fast amd easy refund process bought tht up."	0
"The most economical approach to having mobile service while traveling in Europe is obtaining an unlocked gsm handset.  To begin the RAZR V3i is not a 3G or 4G advanced phone for users expecting broadband media and data services, and signing up to their higher costs.  My purpose was to have basic mobile voice service while traveling in Europe at close to local carrier calling rates.      Europe and parts of Asia cellular standard is gsm, which is also AT&amp;Ts modulation format in US.  The RAZR V3i is a quad band handset that will operate on both Europes gsm bands (900/1800 MHz), and both US gsm bands (850/1900 MHz).      Most important is to acquire the RAZR unlocked, and to be able to simply swap in/out the SIM cards that can be purchased, independently for carrier service provider of choice, for lowest cost competitive rates for either Europe country travel coverage, or basic low cost prepaid in the US."	1

"The MOTO G6 is the highest rated cell phone under $300 so getting it for under $140 was a terrific deal.  Happy with the phone so far, battery life is (for me) about 3 days but admittedly I am a light user.  So if you're cost conscious but still looking for a well made good function phone, I recommend you take a look at the MOTO G6."	1
"The MOTO W755 was THE phone that made me give up my Startac!  I don&apos;t trade phones often &amp; I like fairly simple and straight-forward electronic devices.  The MOTO W755 lets me use the camera, the GPS, and, what was especially important to me when I drown my old one on Memorial Day Weekend, the back-up assistant that keeps all my numbers when I do something STUPID, which I did when I swam with the phone in my suit, with relative ease.   The BA and Verizon tech put all my numbers into the replacement phone, which was also a MOTO W755--I like the thickness (can hold on my left ear), the flip feature (makes me feel like I&apos;m speaking into a &quot;real&quot; phone), the styling (not an iPhone, but not bad)!  I also love that there&apos;s a place for hooking a lanyard for dingle-dangles, very big in Japan &amp; which I&apos;ve come to enjoy.  I hate reading manuals and this phone is fairly easy to figure out, although I learn new things about it often."	1
"The Motorola Cliq is awesome. I have one and got one for my 14 year old too.  Great graphics, easy to use. Love that you can see who is calling you, leaving you text messages, or updating their profile on Facebook all at the same t ime without having to open each link. Love the calendar, the android market options.  Easy to use. Also --- the best part, over an iPhone--- is that you also have the option of typing on a real slide out keyboard. Typing on a flat face phone can be a hassle when your finger keeps linking onto the wrong number or letter. Keys are so much more direct and easier...saving you time!  Love it. This is my third...someone accidentally stepped on mine!  Get one!  (iPhone too expensive if you are not with ATT)"	1
"The Motorola EX430 was presented online as 'unlocked', it is.  However it has carrier bloatware. So, we'll accept that it was our fault in not asking for clarification prior to purchase.  ""Unlocked but Contaminated""  Still for the price as a back up we feel it a good value."	0
The Motorola phone I bought was reported lost or stolen according to the local Verizon Store. I would like a refund or a replacement.	0
"The Motorola Theory was just what I was looking for in a cell phone,the ease of typing text is a breeze and the features that the phone presents are great. I live in LA were the signals are just bad. No matter who you have as a provider or what type of phone that you own, you will have bad reception. However my Motorola fares well in a jungle of IPHONES and SAMSUNGS."	1

The mytouch 4g is a great phone. This is exactly what I would expect from a smartphone. The ease of use and the features are amazing. Truly what a smartphone should be.	1
"The myTouch4G comes with Android 2.2 OS with an HTC Sense user interface. This will give you support for the Exchange email, calendar, and contacts with the widgets and apps that HTC supports like Friend Stream, HTC Sense launcher, HTC weather, myModes, News, Stocks, Peep, etc. Unfortunately, you will not be able to remove some games and apps that come preloaded on the system. Slightly annoying, but not a killer here. If you do not want to use certain apps you can install Launcher Pro and hide the ones you do not wish to see on the application launch screen.    It would be silly not to include the new WiFi Hotspot utility which is similar to the one HTC EVO 4G is sporting. The service costs $15 a month and will allow your MT4G to be a portable WiFi hotspot. You will be able to share a connection with up to five other devices. This is an awesome feature that will have many people willing to shell out the mere $15 a month for the service.    The phone has a price at $199.99 with a $50 rebate as long as you opt for a 2-year contract or extension. Without the contract the phone is $449.99.    The MT4G is a very solid phone that seems to do just about everything you could want it to do. The sound quality is good on the headset as well as the speakerphone. Download speeds are fast, and the service is great in most locations. T-Mobile is doing it right. This phone gets an 8/10 from me."	1
"The new Lenovo MA388 Flip Phone is simply brilliant, long battery life, large screen and lettering, double sim cards and great design. All brilliant, the only flaw is that the instruction booklet and other printed items are solely in Chinese... could be beyond brilliant if also English, like the actual phone. This phone gets full reception where others struggle and has long battery life."	1
"The NewPhone&apos;s size is perfect for carrying in a pocket and the battery has a pretty good lifespan of roughly 4 hours. Overall, I&apos;d recommend the phone if you&apos;re on a budget."	1
"The Nexus 6P is the best stock Google Android phone you can buy right now, and remains one of the best Android devices, period. It is no frills, solid, and attractive. Great value and build quality. "	1
"The Nokia 1680 is really the perfect little candybar phone.  It&apos;s light enough and thick enough to be comfortable to hold up to your ear (unlike other superthin phones that are not).  The full color display is easy to navigate, and the phone is almost 100 percent customizable (which buttons do what, profiles, etc).    There is no side rocker switch to control the volume, but during a call the center toggle keys become an easy to access toggle.    My only problem with it (and with many phones after having owned a Sanyo S1) is that the back cover doesn&apos;t have a lock, meaning the battery can fall out if the phone is dropped.  Most people are used to that happening however with other phones, so I don&apos;t put it as a specific criticism to this phone."	1
"The Nokia 3220 is REALLY GREAT. I love the tones and the way it lights up. I had an older Nokia cellphone that just did&apos;nt live up to it&apos;s name. You could&apos;nt talk very long. The battery would run down in no time, but the 3220 lasts for several days before I have to charge it. When it rings, it really puts on a light show that gets your attention. My friends think it&apos;s the wildest cellphone they&apos;ve ever seen. The camera takes really nice pictures and excellent movies with sound. I checked out alot of different cell phones, but this is the best one I&apos;ve found for my needs."	1
The Nokia 3585 is an exceptionally durable phone and has much better than average reception.  It is a monochrome screen and is very readable.  The keys are large and distinct and easy for older customers and customers with arthritis in their hands to push.    I wish the phone was still available new.	1
"The Nokia 6103 I purchased arrived and wouldn&apos;t work.  I emailed the sender and was told to take it to a T-Mobile store, so I waited until the next day.  The technician there discovered that the screen had a crack in it, and it couldn&apos;t work properly or be fixed.  After I contacted the seller I was told the three days had passed (it was the fourth day), even though I contacted her on the third day.  No reimbursement has been received."	0
The Nokia 6555 phone does not perform as advertised. I purchased one about 6 months back and till date I have changee 4 batteries and till date I do not get a talk time of more than 30 minutes and a standby time of not more than 8 hours. I finally got a battery from Nokia direct and I have the same issue here also. I have been told that this is the problem with the phone itself and not the battery. So then why advertise about the talk time?	0
"The Nokia E62 is a very handy piece of equipment. With the large screen, nearly 3 inches diagonally, you have a pretty nifty mini-tv. There is not much to dislike about the phone. The media player, installed programs and miniSD expandable storage slot makes this very appealing for those that are business orientated. The clarity of voice calls is outstanding.    Although it has no camera, in my opinion, that is a plus, and one of the main reasons I purchased this phone. The built-in mini-USB is also an added plus.    As compared to my other phone, the Nokia E61, there are a few differences. The E61 has a awkward pop port connection used for the headset jack; the E62 comes with the standard 2.5mm. The Nokia E62 surprisingly has no Wi-Fi, a downgrade from the E61.     All in all, the Nokia E62 is a top notch phone.     I give it a 10 out of 10."	1
"The Nokia N97 is the tip of the spear in Nokia&apos;s smartphone lineup. It is the most powerful, smartest and fully featured phone of the company. It is also the first Nokia phone to make use of a large touch-display and that alone has raised the expectations from die hard Nokia fans that have refused to switch over to the iPhone. And Nokia has put quite a lot of work and thought in the N97. I had a first look when Nokia was still developing the N97 and I was looking forward to get my hands on the final product. In this review, I will tell you how I used it, and how well it did. Does the Nokia N97 live up to the hype?  Context    Rushing a review is great to get links, but not the best way to get a good feel for something, so I used the Nokia N97 for a few weeks, mainly as a smartphone with Exchange support. Web browsing was tested regularly to read news and check various sites. Facebook was accessed via the Facebook application included in the phone.  Phone Highlights        * 3.5&quot; Touch Display      * 32GB internal storage + 16GB optional storage vis flash card      * 5 Megapixel Carl Zeiss Lens      * GPS      * WIFI, Bluetooth      * 3.5G      * FM Radio      * Complete specifications (pdf)    Phone Basics (Very Good)    As with any phone, the first thing that I check is how good the sound quality is, and how easy it is to dial a number or a contact. The good news is that the sound quality is good, although the volume is not very loud. It would be nice to have a more powerful sound output.    Dialing a number is quick and relatively efficient. There&apos;s no need to use the physical keyboard as the virtual numeric pad works great and there was no typo whatsoever while dialing numbers.    Dialing a contact is a bit more complex, if you have a bunch of them. From the contact list, you can scroll and click, or type a name and click. Typing a name requires the use of the physical keyboard, which is not very practical if you phone was closed. The T-Mobile G1 suffered from the same lack of virtual keyboard. Every qwerty slider phone should have one.    As you try to dial, the phone will ask you if you want to place a video call, each time! I&apos;ve not seen anyone use video calls (ever), so I think that Nokia should have the option to skip that question. After a week, it was getting on my nerves.    Answering calls is easy, so is placing people on hold, or hang up. Good job Nokia. Locking and unlocking the phone is also easy and foolproof, thanks to the side button.  Physical Design (Good)    The Nokia N97 is a nicely designed phone. The design is agreeable to look at, and the build quality is good, except maybe for the battery cover which has a plastic feel - but it needs to be flexible because it&apos;s *removable*. The display is a mixed bag: it has a resolution of 640x360 but the colors seem a little faded and the clarity seems inferior to other touch phones. I suspect that one of the display layers has something to do with this. Two people that I&apos;ve shown the phone to immediately made the same remark as well.    Next to the speaker, you will notice a front-facing camera and a proximity sensor. The 5 Megapixel camera is in the back, protected by a sliding lens cover. There&apos;s a &quot;camera&quot; button that makes taking picture more natural than taping on the screen (which often induces a last minute shake that could makes photos blurry). The keyboard sliding mechanism feels solid."	1
"The note 4 was sent exactly as advertised and I could not ask for more, thank you. "	1
"THE ONE I BOUGHT WAS POSTED NEW, RECEIVED WITH PRIOR TEXT MESSAGES AND DEFECTIVE SCREEN. MORE SO, IT HAS A BAD MICROPHONE WHERE CALLERS CANNOT HEAR ME SPEAKING."	0
The one I received had A PROBLEM. I had to send it back.	0
The one that I have is an AT&amp;T go phone. I&apos;ve spoken to representatives from AT&amp;T and my cell phone carrier. We were not able to get service on the phone. It&apos;s a piece of junk and a waste of my time!	0
"The only complaint I have is that it does freeze up every once in a while, however it quickly corrects itself ( this is standard on computers so I am not worried)"	1
"The only enjoyable function on this phone, was the dynamic camera! Everything kept freezing up, apps would not work. Everything that could go wrong with this phone, went wrong! This could all be just manufacturer's defects, but I'll never know since we purchased from this site instead of buying straight from manufacturer. I do try to stay away from retail prices all i can in this economy!  "	0
The only negitive thing I can say is I do not like the charging adapter on these phone because this is my 3rd transform ultra and everyone has worked like a charme untill were u hook the charger up the little prongs they always bend. But so far this phone is still working just fine.	1
"The only problem was not receiving it before leaving on a trip out of country,  The two-day mail fee was refunded."	1
"THE ONLY REASON ANYONE WOULD HAVE THIS PAPER WEIGHT IS BECAUSE THEY&apos;RE ON THE IDEN NETWORK!  This is the second i1 Android I&apos;ve had to buy using the poor Boost Mobile iden service, as we&apos;re expanding our business and need another line. It is purely pathetic that Nextel/Sprint doesn&apos;t expand their technology to grow beyond such an inane,  poorly designed (lowest level) Android cell phone exclusively and solely for use on the antiquated iden network!   I use the speaker feature exclusively, but the tiny little insignificant icon to activate it is so UN-strategically located in the bottom corner so close to the the cancel icon that 9 out of 10 times the call gets canceled accidentally! And of course their is no default option to leave the speaker always on.    Without any other Android yet to be aligned with Boost Mobile iden service, it is simply poor beyond belief, and wouldn&apos;t even be considered in the slightest, if any sufficient competition existed.  If your on the iden network because you need to be (otherwise you wouldn&apos;t) and want to at least &quot;resemble&quot; being in this century along with your more fortunate associates NOT needing the iden network, this is all their is. And it &apos;ain&apos;t&apos; pretty.  Matter of fact, it&apos;s just plain sad."	0
the only reason I bought this was for wifi calling and it doesn't work. looked all over the phone to  make it happen and nothing	0
The only thing good about verizon is there phone sevice and signals.. Thats it I dont like the fact that the phones are weakk thats all........	0
"The only thing I disliked is that there is no place for a wrist strap or even one you can hang around your neck so you don&apos;t lose it.  Other than that, I love everything about the phone so far!!!!!"	1
"the only thing i like about it is that it is small and has a camara with great picture quality. But it really got me because i didnt think it would be THAT small when i saw it for the first time. It&apos;s ok. But if you decide to buy a nokia get a longer one that is slim and takes bigger pictures. Thats what i dislike about it. I recoomend it if you need something small and less bulky than regular phones, but please consider getting one with a usb cable because unfortunately i didnt know it had one and mine didnt have one when i bought it. But it&apos;s ok, but not very satisfied because also the myfaves so small because of the screen. To adjust the volume, it is a hassle too. I cant fine where and since there is no button where you can well..that sucks. But overall it isn&apos;t a great phone. So much on buying....."	0
The only thing that is wrong with this phone is that the camera  outer lens glass  will break but it's easy to be replaced 	1
The operating software is hard to see and use. It has locked up numerous times. Intend to install a new sims card. Have tried to use my old one. Disappointing results so far. 	0
The order was shipped quickly and the product is as described.     Any body would love to deal with such a seller.	1
"The original Droid is one of the best Android phones for people who want to have a full slide-out keyboard; the Droid 2 has a faster processor, but really hurts to buy one at the moment.  The Droid is also one of the easiest phones to root (jail-break / hack / crack / etc) that you can buy, with an extremely active community of developers giving you just about everything you could want.  The Verizon Droids I buy are easy to clean off the bloat, and activate on other networks (or on Verizon -- remember, to activate a Verizon handset on Verizon it _must_ have a clean ESN [MEID]; meaning the person who had it before you fulfilled their contractual commitments, didn&apos;t report it lost or stolen, etc).  I&apos;m not a huge Motorola fan, and would love HTC to issue an Android handset based on the Touch Pro 2 (keeping the keyboard and the Worldphone capabilities), but until that time -- I&apos;ll choose the Droid as my #1 pick for Android smart phones in the used market (if you&apos;re getting a brand new phone from Verizon under contract -- the Droid 2 is probably the right choice)."	1
The OS of the phone restricst incoming or outgoing calls in the phone for T-mobile or AT&amp;T lines. The erros message comes up every time you make a call.    The problem is easy to fix. Get the V5.0.0428 OS and downgrade the operating systems. Works like a charm.    As for the rest. It is an excellent toy.    V13996373	1
The other reviews seem to be fake to me. This points me towards the idea that this seller isn't authentic.	0

"The Palm Treo 650 is an excellent phone, with great battery life and a large number of Palm apps available for it.  I have owned now three of them, and have replaced them as they wore out from constant, heavy use.  The most recent one I just purchased from eBay for a mere $10, yet it was almost brand-new.    After updating the new phone&apos;s firmware to the latest and greatest v1.13 for Sprint and transferring everything to the phone from my old one using Mega Launcher&apos;s Backup/Restore function on an SD Card, I&apos;m all set for another 2-3 years of great service -- for only $10!    Eventually, I may switch to a newer generation phone, such as a Pre 2, iOS or Android unit for the GPS, 4G speed, Quad Band, applications and the many other different benefits that they bring, but for now, the Treo 650 is still a highly durable, rugged phone that goes anywhere and works flawlessly."	1
"The Pantech Marauder works great, I wanted a cheap phone with  actual keys and this phone is exactly what I needed. It's a good quality phone, reacts quickly, the interface is intuitive and it comes with useful features that you come to expect from a smart phone."	1
the parcel did not reach me	0
the pda does not work properly  it is uspposed to have gps but that never worked either    i have to keep it because i do not want to upset the feelings of seller	0
The people I bought it from were the best!	1
The performance and finishes of the cell phone have really pleased me. Very good investment.	1
"The person is really a genuine one, he clarify all my question and given me satisfactory answer.    Really want to purchase from him in future."	1
"The person said the phone was new in box. This was actually a used phone. I bought it for my mom she likes this type of phone, because it is easy for her to use. The person who sold this phone lead me to believe it was a new phone when actually it was used."	0
"The phon was recived at time but the screen stopped working after two weeks and no good solution was find, it may be cheap but doesnt worth the price."	0
the phone  caught on fire in my lap  and  i will nevet buy  or do buisness with this seeller agai  it didnt last a week i loved it but i  cant believe ikt  got so hot  thought  nothing of it  at first  then  it started to burn thru my cllothing and i  will sue this  scandle  for what  i paid for   and  really did get burned	0
The phone  more scratched  in the case  	0
"The phone abruptly powered off and will not boot up again. There are plenty of forums about this exact issue, which seems to stem from an inherent short-circuit flaw in the lcd.   "	0
"The phone and the accessories are the real value, I cannot hear anyone when I'm in a call unless its on speaker and they can barely hear me.   It did not state this in the ad, so I feel hustled. But the price was low and it came with alot of accessories so I figured its whatever. I broke my other phone and needed one asap. Next time be clear with all issues. "	0
"The phone arrive 2 days after I ordered,  but half of yhe back cover was unglued,  I can see the inside the phone. Very bad product.  "	0
"The phone arrived a day earlier than expected.  Good condition as stated, my daughter will be happy. Thank you so much for your honesty as well. Ebay makes purchases easy."	1
The phone arrived earlier than I thought and was in great condition and packed to be shipped safely. Great purchase. Thank you. 	1
"The phone arrived fast and was in excellent condition: no scratches and looking new. The phone was packaged with bubble wrap in a way that would prevent it from being broken in the transport. The battery life if quite long and charging once every 1 or 2 days is more than enough to ensure you don't run out of power. It came with its USB cord and a wall adapter. The only complain I have is that the wall adapter is unusable because the USB plug is not aligned with the hole. But, overall, excellent phone and I recommend this seller. "	1
The phone arrived in a quick matter of time and it was also in the same condition as the picture should it. Thank you.	1
The phone arrived in good time but the #9 button is faulty. 	0
The phone arrived in great shape and was brand new but the seller forgot to add on the listing that it is a very old phone and does not match up with new sim cards. I am able to use the phone but not save any contact information which is a pain the butt......    I am in the process of shopping around for a new phone that will work with my sim card.	0
The phone arrived LOCKED.	0
The phone arrived on time and it was in fact in excellent condition. No complaints there. It's been 2 weeks and so far so good. It works and I've had no issues. 	1
The phone arrived quickly and in pristine condition BUT it was advertised as working on the Sprint network and when I took it to the store to get activated I was told it is not compatible with the network. 	0
The phone arrived quickly in better condition than stated and worked like new.  Im now buying another used phone from them for my wife.     cant beat the shipping!	1
"The phone arrived well packed, in a timely manner. It looked practically new. The company that sold it was awesome. An inexperienced clerk said the phone was locked and I bought one that was supposedly unlocked. I sent the seller several complaining messages and they answered each one, immediatly, and with consern. They would do anything to satify my complaint. A friend told me about another store where the clerks were informed and they were able to give me service. The phone was never locked."	1
"the Phone Arrived without a Battery,  don&apos;t Understand how a Store is sending a Phone without Battery."	0
The phone battery  wasn't  good.... if you selling at least let the buyer know the faults	0
"The phone being pre-owned appeared to work fine however useless as far as service to make phone calls or text because there was no way to swap my number to the phone. The previous owners number was still active. I contacted the seller and asked if they had any phones WITH the SIM card and they said they do not have any WITH SIM cards. This seller should identify this in the description when selling! I was 1000 miles away from home getting cancer treatments for my granddaughter having this issue, waiting to return and buy another phone from another seller because my phone was broken.  "	0
The phone broke after it was dropped once outside on cement. The was phone was in a protective case and that didnt help one bit.  The screen wouldnt turn on. The screen had separated itself from the back of the phone.  Even though I was under warranty the seller didnt want to help me. Plus it turned out to be a 5 gig phone and not an 8 gig phone.  I had to sell the phone for parts. This was a horrible purchase!	0
"The phone broke, it will not charge at all. A TOTAL WASTE OF MY MONEY!"	0
The phone came and with the operating system on it.  I couldn't add most of my apps.  I requested a refund and still waiting for an email on where to send it for my refund minus the 15% restocking fee.	0
The phone came assigned to Sprint and Assurance Wireless cannot get rid of it yet...to worse things both phones now are assigned to Sprint and we cannot use any of them. Neither the old or this we bought.	0
"The phone came dirty.  The screen has water damage.  The phone doesn&apos;t hold a charge.  I wish I had researched more on how to use ebay and better understood the return policies,  I did shortly after the purchase contact the seller to see what I could do.  I never heard back.  I understand I brought a used product and with that it may need to be cleaned up so that is the big problem.    IT stinks!"	0
"The phone came earlier than expected,  was easy to activate and has no issues. I recommend this to anyone looking for a phone. "	1
"The phone came from China and took a while to get here.  But it&apos;s exactly what was promised, and have worked so far."	1
"The phone came in a timely fashion, with new charger and headphones, etc. However, it was locked to the previous owner's account and was essentially a brick phone. Could not activate it at all.  Description does not explicitly say it is unlocked so be aware that it will be hit or miss with these phones!"	0
"The phone came in excellent condition just as it was described in the add.  There were no scratches and the phone is in working order.  The order was shipped in a timely manner, the only mistake was that it was shipped to the billing address and not to the shipping address for some reason.  Other than that, it was an excellent buy!  The phone takes some getting used to for texting because of the button size but it is easy to use and the features available are great.  The size is also nice because it is not too big for a smartphone but not too small to be difficult to use.  Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase."	1
"The phone came in great condition and according to the way it was described. It's a beast of a phone. I use the S Pen all the time. So much ram. Great software. The finger print sensor is beyond belief. The only things that I wish they could have done better is a replaceable battery and a less bulky version of android. Oh and how about the glass on the back be less breakable, Samsung? Why does it have to be so fragile? "	1
The phone came in in less than a week. packaged nicely and loved the new unopened nokia box it came in. There was no damage to the box or the phone. Phone runs nicely lagged a little on its FIRST start up but after going through everything once it ran like a dream. Great phone from a great seller for a great price!!!!! A++++++++	1
The phone came in without microphones soldered to the main PCB. As I could use the other parts the Seller and I came to an agreement to credit me back $30.00 of the purchase price. 	0
"The phone came on time and does appear to be new.  This was a very good price for a new 64 gig IPhone 8.  So far, there have been no issues with the phone itself - just wish I could say the same about the setup through ITunes and Apple!  If you have those kinds of problems, just describe the issue in Google and plenty of others can tell you what they did to resolve them - this worked for me and Im very happy with my phone. It was unlocked for my carrier as advertised and battery life has been excellent so far!"	1
The phone came packaged like new in a white plain box along with a brand new Samsung charger. The phone itself looks brand new with no scratches or scuffs of any kind. The battery on the other hand does not seem to hold a charge as long as a new battery should this is my 3rd day using it and as it seems to hold good enough I find myself putting it on charge about twice a day. This phone is awesome I absolutely love the Samsung Galaxy Note Edge it is worth the money you will not be disappointed and if I have to buy a new battery then it's worth it for the price and condition of this phone!! Thank you seller!!	1
"The phone came quickly, but was on the eula diagnostics.  There was no way to move off the screen for none of the buttons functioned not even the power button.  I could not do a hard start to try to reset the factory settings because of nonfunctioning buttons.  "	0

The phone charger is not compatible with an Android chargers even tho it's an Android phone. There's only one way of doing video text and it's with low resolution....it's either that or emailing videos. I do love the size of the phone and battery life is amazing. The seller does not answer your questions nor is the seller helpful, instead the seller requested I send the phone back. I would not recommend buying from this seller. Thanks!"	0
"the phone came with the wrong battery which would die after one phone call, the logos on the &apos;snake skin&apos; fell off right after i opened the phone! do not recommend this seller whatsoever!"	0
The phone came withouth the s pen write the seller and he never respond. The phone is new and no S pen. IMEI on box is different than on the phone	0
The phone can not send/receive text messages nor phone calls.  Sending the phone back to seller.  The phone does not work as expected so not happy with the phone.  I am contacting the seller to let them know and hopefully will be able to send the phone back and receive a refund.	0
The phone case is designed very poorly once you put it on the phone several of the functions of the phone are no longer accessible the plastic is hard and unplayable you can't get to the edge of the phone which is the main reason for the phone's existence anyways very poorly designed and quality of materials is not good either	0
The phone condition is great. But it's not factory unlocked  It's Verizon wireless phone and unable to update .	0
The phone could not be activated.  Seller did refund the price of the phone and original shipping but I was still out for shipping the phone back.  The phone was supposed to be new in Box.  It was not.  I also had to wait for 2 weeks to receive the phone and almost 2 more weeks for the refund.	0
"the phone couldn't  be powered on when I get it. after 12 hours charged, it was still couldn't be powered on, and seller ask me to pay return shipping fees, then they refund it. I had to repair it in local phone shop."	0
The phone dealer said the phone cannot be activated and the seller is saying oh well about 170 00. So Im still trying to resolve this issue through eBay . 	0
The phone did not come unlocked. I am very disappointed that it was locked when I got it. I bought it to have a second phone. I still don&apos;t have the code. I wasted my money.	0
"The phone did not have a battery, which I knew when I bought it.  I got a battery and when I put it all together, the phone does not work.  Also the little white strip that shows whether it has had water damage or not, is missing....it appears  I have been taken for a ride."	0
The phone did not operate when i received it.This was not the sellers fault it may have happened while being shipped.	0
The phone did not work and I was not able to get it to work though Metro PCS as told by the seller. I was refunded my money in full.	0
The phone did not work but the seller was able to return my money. I would do business with he again.	0
The Phone did not work very well for something to go online with. It is very slow. Battery life was bad. You could text ok with it.It worked ok for phone calls. It did have some problems acting crazy sometimes. I would not recommend this phone.	0

The phone didn&apos;t work when I received it.   Turns on fine and appears to work except you never receive a signal.  Even when right next to a transmission tower. Had to go back to my old phone.	0

"the phone dies really fast even with a new battery, also if your close to the prepaid plan to run out, multimedia messeges and text messegse start to take a while and a lot even won&apos;t download so you lose the message until you add more time and wait 1day after."	0
The phone does has a SD card slot but the phone does not allow any apps to be placed on it so unless you just want ringtones and photo capabilities you will not like this phone.	0
The phone does not display good images. It is not very well functional either. When I tried to stay in contact with the seller they would not reply to my messages.

"The phone does not work, and seller cannot activate the phone. Have contacted several stores & also called TracFone, but no one is willing to activate the phone because it was not bought from them. Even TracFone refuses to activate the phone. Under all these circumstances, seller refuses to accept return for a useless phone that should never have been sold in the first place. Scam! "	0

The phone had visible scratches on the screen and back of the phone. That was not in the product description. When we got it and started setting it up we discovered the phone was not able to connect to the WiFi. Had to contact the seller who provided the return label and we had to send it back. A week later still no replacement. Havent heard from the seller either on their plan how to resolve this issue. So far not happy. Will see how it goes from here.

"The phone has had problems from day one. looked up some of the problems to only notice many flaws in the structure and operations of the phone. The phone is coming apart, works only 30% of the time, took forever to set up because it came in chinese.....I could go on and on. The phone is NOT an authentic Sony phone. Did contact the seller about the flaws and malfunctions and was told I could send it back and wait for refund....huh....it took me a month to get it because it came from china, would take me a month to send it back by regular mail because i was told by the seller that it wouldnt make it through customes if i sent it any other way, wait a month for my money back....not worth it but would never order from this place again. HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE!!!!!"	0

"The phone having the android interface is magnificent! I enjoy all of the features that is has to offer! It takes great pictures, is fast and responsive and I&apos;m extremely satisfied with the purchase! The only thing that I dislike is the 5Gb cap on data usage since I&apos;m paying for unlimited data, but that is something to discuss with the carrier and has nothing to do with the phone itself.  It just isn&apos;t fair to the phone&apos;s capabilities since the carrier isn&apos;t keeping up with it.  I love the phone!"	1
"The phone I bought and paid for never arrived.  It took 2 days to receive an invoice,  5 days after it was to have been shipped they emailed that the kids had spilled water on it and I would receive a refund.  I should have had it in my hands by the time they emailed me that they had had an accident. I still have not recieved my refund."	0

The phone i bought here is not charging and not connecting to the computer too.	0
The phone I bought the speaker does not let the other party hear me !! Can not return it due to the fact I told her I was on a fixed income and can not afford another phone and I already purchased my sims and plan before I got the phone  !! Best buy said it would cost a lot to fix !! Buyers beware !!	0
The phone I bought was in excellent condition as detailed by seller. Prompt delivery and a pleasure to do business with. Great prices on this sellers other items. I will definitely recommend my family and friends to do business with this seller. In fact I just told some people at work. Thank you guys for everything. 	1
The phone I don't think was new and had a box that wasn't sealed off.  Screen makes a crackling noise which I emailed Samsung about with no reply ever.  Service sucks big time and I probably would never buy another Samsucks product because of this reason alone.  Service is mediocre at best and that's putting it nicely.   You expect 700-1000 dollar product to be better put together and better service in general.  Samsung sucks get yourself anything but a Samsucks phone or anything else for that matter.  	0
THE PHONE I GOT DOES NOT WORK IT DOES NOT HOLD CHARGE ALSO IT IS NOT UNLOCKED .I AM NOT HAPPY WITH THE PURCHASE I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO USE IT	0
the phone i got was in better condition then i thought it was and arrived quick and was vary well protected in the packaging it was shipped in.  I&apos;m very impressed	1
"The phone I got was sketchy. it cam in some random box while it was branded as new never opened, the screen wasnt flush with the top frame and within an hour the HT from HTC at the back peeled off. It was probably a fake. Otherwise it worked well but overall it's an expensive phone for what you get. go for a Galaxy s4 mini. cheaper, a tad smaller but a lot better. for 350 you could get a used galaxy. I used it for like 2 months and never fell in love with it so I sold it for 250 on Kijiji. Also, if you like to root your phones, this is the worst option, not many roms exist for this phone, i found only 3 and they all were meh. Again, the Galaxy has a tons of options and works better when rooted. Also easier to root than this one. It's not a bad phone but it should never be your first choice. I wouldnt recommend it."	0
The phone I needed because I lost mine. Between the time I lost mine and the new on e arrived the warranty on the new on was only seven days from shipment I was told. Well The phone does not work at all and I was told by cingular I have to send it to motorolla. I notified the seller and Got a automated response! So I guess with short warranty and a new phone that never worked I am not real happy	0
The phone I paid for and the one I received are not the same. The phone I received is a cheap quality phone. I tried to contact seller and received no answer. Not someone I will do business with again. Now to contact EBAY about this matter.	0
The phone I purchased from this seller is exactly as advertised . The shipping was very fast.I will buy from this seller again.Thanks JL	1
"The phone I purchased had apparent damage. The DOT to specify moisture had been removed. Phone seemed to operate at first, but soon started rebooting itself while being used, quite often I might add. When I removed the battery I noticed the round area where the moisture DOT had been."	0
"The phone I purchased said that it was in great working condition. When I received the phone I plugged it in to charge the phone and it wouldn&apos;t charge. I tried a brand new charger that I know worked and it still wouldn&apos;t charge.  I contacted the seller he had me send it back to him and he said I would receive a full refund. I tracked the package and saw that he had received it, went back on ebay to find out when I could expect my refund and he had closed his account. This was the worst experience I have ever expienced on ebay, which makes me second guess myself before I purchase stuff off ebay again which I never did in the past."	0
"The phone I purchased through Ebay was ineffective -- I got no reception in my house.  I had to go outside in order to talk,  not good!!!  I returned the phone to the seller two weeks ago and so far, I have not received my refund, as I was promised."	0
The phone I purchased was in excellent condition and I'm very happy with my purchase! It shipped faster and was in better than promised condition compared to other sellers I purchased from.	1
"The phone I purchased was suppose to be ""New other"" but what I received was a beat up used phone, It has a small chipped off piece inside the headphone jack and also has many scratches near the charging port. The seller hasn't even bothered to respond.  They sent me a used phone and charged me for a new one basically. Beware an buy elsewhere."	0
"The phone I received doesn&apos;t work, I can&apos;t activate it because it&apos;s registered in someone else&apos;s name, and there is money owed on it. I contacted the seller, and he was very rude to me and basically told me good luck getting my money back or a new phone. This guy is very unprofessional and rude!"	0
The phone I received from this seller did not last a full week. It stopped charging after its 6th day of service. The ONLY reason that I have not pursued resolution with this seller and ebay is that I happen to have cell phone insurance that replaced this piece of junk with a working phone. 	0
The phone I received turned out to be a knock-off. I didn't found this until I took the phone to repair. The phone couldn't open after a single day of use. 	0
the phone i received was a stolen phone. i decided to buy it to save money. i picked the wrong seller.	0
the phone i received was a stolen phone. i decided to buy it to save money. i picked the wrong seller.	0
The phone I received was defective and the listing stated otherwise. I was sent a replacement phone and it was also defective. The seller would not replace the 2nd defective phone or return my money.	0
"THE PHONE I RECEIVED WAS IN VERY BAD CONDITION. SOME OF THE KEYS DIDN&apos;T WORK AND WOULD TURN OFF RANDOMLY.  AFTER READING OTHER REVIEWS, I&apos;M WONDERING IF THIS PHONE IS BEING RESOLD AFTER IT IS RETURNED!!!!!!!IT HAS BEEN A WEEK SINCE I RETURNED THE PHONE AND AM STILL WAITING FOR MY REFUND."	0
"The phone I received will not function properly. Since the moment I got it, it turns off intermittently and I cannot restart it unless I plug it in. It does not matter what the charge level is.  The seller will not deliver what it is I payed for and is offering me a partial refund for battery replacement.   I would just like to have a functioning phone.  Not happy. "	0
"the phone i return it to the seller because the phone is not good phone it didn,t fell the sd card at all the battery is not good it take over 10 hour to charge and is really slow in the net it should be 3g but is not it work on edge and the pack cover is not the same like the picture so the phone is not good at all compare to any other lg and i hope i get my money pack"	0
"The phone in general is excellent, at least as far as my needs are concerned, however, not happy with the one i received! The battery never seems to last more than an hour&apos;s phonecall maximum, and even though i was sent a second battery problem persists (i had same model before so, i know this is not supposed to happen), and even though i take good care of it and have never dropped it, in less than a year since purchase, there&apos;s already a crack on the open fold which seems to get bigger every time i open the fold to answer a call! That purchase was a BIG waste of money. VERY dissapointed with seller."	0
"The phone is a awesome , great condition at a great price . The sell gave great description of the phone . Shipping was Super Fast . I highly Recommend this seller . I will buy from seller again ."	1
"The phone is a garbage in the America.  You will have dropped calls at every time u make or receive a call. Dead spots everywhere. It has the basic nokia os, nothing fancy feature. The phone itself is gorgeous! My wife loved it. The problem is the worst phone carrier has 5 times better signals everywhere than this phone."	0
"the phone is a good phone but it didnt come unlocked as advertsed now  have to pay to get it unlocked , defeatng the whole purpose of buyng t unlocked .tred my sim card and it reads wrong sm card. im unhappy."	0
"The phone is a junk because it won't turn on after I charged it and it is just dead. Took the back cover off and removed the battery then put it back on, it's s still the same. Rebooted, same thing. Frustrated and guess throw it away and never buy a cellphone from Ebay but from a store personally."	0
The phone is a piece of junk. Signal sucks on it. Keeps dropping calls when switches towers.	0
The phone is a very sharp device. It has excellent battery life along with great multi-window option. The talk to text is almost perfect. It blows Iphone and windows out of the water. There is not much if any to not to like about this device.	1
"The phone is advertised to be boost mobile. It's a lie, the network is sprint,"	0
"The phone is amazing. Unfortunately, the customer support behind it is extremely poor. Purchased this phone back December 2017, had an RMA in March as half of the screen was freezing (look it up on youtube) and exchanged it at the Microsoft store. 6 months later a second screen issue has now occurred, this time the top 1/2"" of the screen digitizer is not responding to touches. This is also a defect and has videos posted online. The manufacturer is very, very difficult to deal with. It takes a minimum of 48 hours for any sort of response and currently they can't even assist me as they don't have these in stock. This is the most frustrating customer service experience I have ever had in my life and I am very disappointed with the company behind this phone, as the device itself was amazing when it worked."	0
"The phone is as described but the description for the phone is very misleading... it said (unlocked) but when the phone was delivered the seller wrote on a sticky note that in order to use the phone I need to purchase a Verizon SIM card. I've purchased unlocked phones online before and I never had to buy a SIM card from a specific carrier in order to use it. The description was misleading and it should have stated that in the details or else I wouldn't have purchased it. The packaging was horrible and the phone could have been possibly damaged during the mailing process. So overall this experience wasn't good for me, now I have to go out my way in order to use the phone. "	0
The phone is as described.  So far so good and fast shipping. Would highly recommend to anyone. Thank you!	1
"The phone is awesome! I have been a long time apple customer, but I think apples prices on their phones is getting a little crazy. I thought I would miss home button , but pretty much use side button instead. Love face recognition, it just signs u in to everything without having to do anything. Love wireless charging as well. "	1
The phone is awful.  Verizon service is very poor.  The phone battery won&apos;t hold a charge.  Everything about this phone is a HUGE disappointment.  Can&apos;t WAIT until our contract with Verizon is over and I can use something else.	0
"The phone is beautiful. My daughter love it and it came on earlier. It has flash in the back camera and in the front camera too, so for selfies is awesome..Thanks Xgody Team."	1
The phone is brand new. There is no problem at all. It has longer battery life and big improvement on camera. It is a very good value phone.	1
The phone is broken.  Seller does not give me a solution.  I&apos;m just disappointed in this deal.    EREZ	0
The phone is crap beat to shit	0
"the phone is defective. Number keys are non-functional. I have not yet attempted to address this issue with the seller because of my personal health issues. And since it doesn&apos;t work at all, i will ask the seller for a full refund and if he&apos;s honest and sincere i should not have any problems. Will keep u posted!"	0
"the phone is easy to us and a great value for its price, can make call with ease and text friends and family as well. MY Mother is 60 and she loves hers. dont be scared to buy one."	1

The phone is garbage	0
The phone is giving me problem since last 1 week..despite of fully charge and replacign new battrey it shut off every 5 minutes...Not happy with this deal...	0
The phone is good but I still had to take it to the Verizon store and get a new sim card because one that came with it didn't work. Other than that the phone is really nice and good deal.	1
The phone is good for the people who aren&apos;t looking for something fancy. It provides all of the necessary functions and is very lightweight as well small in size which is a plus. I Would recommend this phone for the person who is looking for affordability and simplicity.	1
"The phone is good, the only issue is the batery wont hold power long, have to recharge every 4-5 hour."	1
The phone is great alternative phone to the expensive Samsung Galaxy Phones.  Does everything you need and more. Love the fingerprint scanner on the back.  Also supports dual SIMs if you need this feature. 	1
The phone is great does everything i want it to do very easy to use up to date with bluetooth mp3 player facebook and many more internet services. Camera on the phone is 110% pictures are great quality and many different settings and shoot modes to select. I decided to buy it not only due to the price was the lowest i have found but its a great phone would recomend it to anyone looking for a simple easy stylish phone to use	1
The phone is great looks almost brand new all buttons and the wheel are all working the screen did not have any scratches on it	1
"The phone is great, but all the previous security features are lost with Android ...Blackberry should have worked on their operating system instead, and hopefully they do, buy a Blackberry that runs its own operating system to have the MOST security without all the snooping of droid.  But still a great phone if you dont mind your info looked at. One star for that.  Highly recommended, awesome keyboard! Five stars for the phone itself. "	0
"The phone is great, it is the best phone that I had!  Since I was using SyMBiN and then WinMo I can also say that the ANDROID rocks! It is the best OS for phones ever, and I know that the majority of Symbian and WinMo users will have their Android phone soon...    The only thing that I miss in Vibrant is FM RDS receiver and FM transmitter, but maybe the hardware is there..."	1
"The phone is great, work fast and good screen and camera!  The shepmant was fast.  This seller is great!! Thanks!"	1
The phone is great.  It was purchased for my son who absolutely loves it.  It came quickly and the seller provided a link for the user guide which was very helpful.	1
"The phone is great. Functioning as designed, no issues noted"	1
The phone is great. I like how its touch screen buttons in the front and the slider wheel makes it easier to browse things. I decided to buy it because i liked this phone so much (the first one i had) but it broke so i got a new one and i enjoy it.	1
the phone is great. no issues. we have been very happy with this brand and model of phone in the past and would recommend it to anyone.	1

The phone is in the exact shape as was described.  Very good to work with.  Shipping was very fast.  I would buy from them again no problem.	1
"The phone is just as described, fortunately the burnt on the display was not pretty high. I think its a good offer but the battery arrived damaged. Frecuently it's 90%  of charge so in few minutes it decrease to 15%  when I plug the charger it gets abruptly to 50%. Now I need to change the phone battery."	0
The phone is just what I was wanting. I have good service with my phone.  I love the triple minutes.	1
"The phone is like brand new, delivery was very quick well before the stated times quoted.  Overall iam very happy and will deal with this supplier again ,I highly recommend them. Thank you."	1
The phone is like the 5S but better	1
"The phone is little more than just a phone.  There is only the most basic of applications and no games.  The thing is, it is a phone that is built to outlast the owner in no uncertain terms. ----     Its basic feature set and user interface is easy to navigate and use.  The audio quality is easily understood and can be turned loud enough to overshadow most large equipment.  Its obscenely long battery life is quite nice as well.  ----     It excels at being a phone under harsh conditions.  No more destroying the phone on a job site or having the rain wipe it out.  Ever.  As of this writing, it is the one and only industrialized phone of this magnitude which is compatible with the North American 3G frequencies.  With the gradual phase out of GSM for UTMS, this is incredibly important for those who are never quite sure where they might end up working. ----     The one disappointment is that its European connectivity is limited to GSM only.  A pentaband radio would have made this THE industrialized world phone."	1
The phone is locked to Sprint. The seller does not answer.	0
The phone is lovely! Thank you for prompt shipping! Only complaint I have is that the envelope it came in was beaten up! But that's not necessarily your fault. 	1
the phone is my favorite color and i like it because it is cute to me but i just want to know if the phone has internet?	0
The phone is new but the box has been opened. The worst thing is that the charging cable that it came with it dose not fit into it I had to use a different cable from an older phone I have 	0
"The phone is nice but not the best program format. Anyhow thats not really a problem its something you can get used too, the real issue I had with this phone is that its turns off by itself randomly even if it has been fully charged. I had an iisue with the fact that you are given like three days or something to exchange if defective but mine was a gift for my husband and we didnt discover the issue until about one week or two into buying the phone and it is hard getting calls or messages because the phone turns off. Was excited to get the phone but in the end disappointed a phone thats suppose to be new should fail that way :("	0
"the phone is nice, was beat up more than i thought described, but the type of phone is super................................................................................................................................................"	0
"The phone is NO NEW, is refurbished, and came with bad charger,  Please change the description, No honest seller, Negative Feedback for the seller.  "	0
"The phone is not a new phone, its used one, but seller mentioned it's complety new. entire phone is fully buggy with scraches...I was wasting money...PLs reimburse the same..I don;t want this product any more"	0
"The phone is not good because ever since it has been delivered to me o was unable to on it and I sent an email to the seller to send me return label for me to return it back to him but he is just playing and tricking me by telling me to repair it he will pay me the charges but I to him I dont have the time and he didnt respond back to me since then, so I will urge eBay to help me contact the seller so he can do what I asked him to do to protect the image and goodwill of eBay, thanks and God bless, Adeniyi AWOLESI"	0
"The phone is not new according to the seller, and restored. Generally scammers."	0
The phone is not open because is does not let put my Apple ID.    I made new Apple ID and it does not accept.    I had many Apple phones and I know how it works.   Now I have 1 phone that does not connect with my others Apples.	0
"The phone is not that mention  I can't use the phone, is not unlocked "	0
"The phone is not unlocked , it does not meet specifications set forth in the notice.

the phone is not work	0
The phone is not working even charge is not working the phone talk speaker not working	0

The phone is not working. There's a problem that the phone repair shops cannot fix. Either I need a replacement or can I get my money back.	0
The phone is of a certain manufacturing that won't allow root. Seller did not specify what make of One M83 the phone would be.	0
the phone is ok it got me throug until i got my replacement phone its not the best byts just a backup phone	0
The phone is okay but battery won&apos;t last for more than 30minutes! Not convenient  for travellers battery will be off any time.	0
"the phone is only made to look new. It even comes in a sealed box to trick you into thinking its brand new. It is not new at all. It comes with cheap knock-off apple earpods and charger, all of which was the least of my concern. The phones earpiece volume is extremely low, the battery drained WAY to fast, and even shut the phone down at 50% (it wouldn't even turn back on until you charged it) All of these problems come from the phone being used and ""refurbished"". I've owned these phones before and never had these issues. I highly doubt they actually test it before selling. I am returning the item and never buying from them again."	0

The phone is so old you cant buy a charger for it and it is a bad investment	0

The phone is supposed to be awesome but this seller is not 	0
The phone is to small and it's very slow to respond this phone is a Miss I would not recommend 	0
The phone is unusable because it has a lock on it which is the owners email. The case said that is was closed.  CLOSED! I don&apos;t think so.thats a lot of money not to mention huge disappointment from my daughter.	0
"the phone is used, but in excellent condition better than described. below average price. old version and baseband firmware, easy to jailbreak and unlock."	1
"The Phone is ver good,has a Great camera, Great storage capacity, is very fast, it a very good option!"	1
"The phone is very compact and light, but also durable. I would recommend this model to anyone who wants a good phone that can take a bit of a beating and still work when you need it to."	1
The phone is very easy to use and to learn to use.  Is a very attractyive phone and is the perfect size for anyone.  I broke my old phone and bought this one becasue of how other people felt about it.  The menus are set up very well and the sound is excellent.  Two thumbs way up for this phone!	1
"The phone is very good, meets all the characteristics described, brings the right accessories, I recommend it."	1
The phone is very light and fairly compact. It provides great color screen and an incredible value at a price of $49.99 brand new with no contract required.	1
"The phone is very nice. It has everything you need. I like that it has a touch screen and also a full keyboard. I dont like trying to text on a touch screen. This phone allows you to text on the keyboard which, for me, is much easier. It is very nice and well worth the money."	1
The phone is was a great buy. The seller is great	1
"The phone is well built, not clunky as some sliders can be, performance is awesome with the Dual Core processor."	1
"The phone is working fine,it is what I expected "	1
"the phone isn&apos;t reading the SIM card consistently. probably why it was available in the first place, but don;t really know for sure."	0
"The phone isn't unlocked as advertised, and the battery dies within 2 hours"	0
The phone it's in perfect condition.	1
"The phone itself arrived promptly and in the expected condition. However, the serial number on the back of the phone was missing, and I was unable to activate it for use. After talking to at least three different phone company representatives, I discovered that it was impossible to activate the phone without the serial number sticker on the back, even though the seller told me that I could. The seller told me there was no way to provide me with the serial number, so I couldn&apos;t activate the phone, and now I have to throw it away instead. Ultimately, I ended up wasting my money and a lot of time, and the seller did not prove helpful at all."	0
"the phone itself is aweful!!! windows phones are awful! i bought the phone apps but little did i know the apps are awful, and there are very little of them! i would never recommend this phone to anyone!"	0
"The phone itself is great, although Sprint does not have 4G yet.The Phone came from Sprint with a card in it to take pictures from the phone, with good  resolution.  Seller described the phone as camera works, which it did not, without my purchasing at card, that came with the phone and seller removed without letting the buyers know this. I had a apple 3 G and this is a very comparible phone, except when Sprint gets the 4G network, this phone will rock, its user friendly also."	1
"The Phone Itself Is Really Good... I Love It, It Has Many Features And many specs... "	1
"the phone itself was not as described completely; 1. being the phone was not in that excellent of condition. 2. the phone was not stated to be smart cellular device, that in which when sim was inserted, needed a data plan of at least 2.75$ from at&amp;t. 3. recognized by at&amp;t that the phone was in fact a dummy phone that culd not of been unlocked &amp; used. 3. of course, the sellers difficulty of S&amp;H charges returns due to his &quot;ignorance to choose a different route of sending&quot;    lastly, the complete selfish, undeniably, over all interaction sucked, and was not enjoyable. he did not try to help the best he could, at best he staled my 3 days of return so i could not receive my money and i have sent the phone back to them, the very same way it came to me, and they claim it has not been received. long story short, you&apos;re better off buying the phone from at&amp;t themselves or just upgrading.    overall: seller &quot;netsellsit&quot; is not worth it."	0
the phone just worked for a couple months afther that was locked i can not used anymore i dont know what happened looks like the first owner selled and he was making payments and stop making payments and noe the phone is lock	0
"The phone keeps freezing up ,is terrible I'm switching back to my old phone"	0
The phone kept blanking out....	0
The phone lasted 3 weeks and went dead. I called and the girl said to send it back. I sent it back and they returned it to me still broke. It happened at day 30 of the 30 day return policy. Don't waste your money here. Lots of good reviews but this one isn't one of them. I would have gladly paid an extra $100 for another phone but they refuse to communicate. I now own a $214 paperweight!! Buyer beware!	0
"The phone lasted only 3 months and I have paid $98 for it. Very slow charging and it overheats a lot to the point of 90 degrees where you can't even hold the phone. The phone eventually died by the end of March 2018 itself. Had the battery replaced for $23 but later realized that the motherboard was faulty and the power IC got fried due to overheating. To replace the board it will cost me $43 but the seller told me that the phone has 1 year guarantee and asked me to send it back to them. I'll have to pay $50 to send it back to them now but refused as I will be the one who will lose all my money on this product. Lessons learned, will never buy phones online again."	0
"the phone look like renew phone, Doesn&apos;t look brand new as the description.The the poor shipping, Doesn&apos;t recommend purchase from this seller at all."	0
The phone looked fine but I couldn&apos;t get it to work on the verizon network and ultimately had to buy a new phone altogether.	0
The phone looked great. Tested when I got it but after 2 days the phone sounded as if it was raining inside the phone when people called me. 	0
"The phone looked new as stated, judging by appearance and the new esn#.  However, the phone would not power up and because it would not power up, I was not able to activate the phone or obtain service as the phone had to power up in order to be programed for use.      I Contacted the seller with 4 phone calls, no one was available to assist me, I was told on each call.      Went to 3 different cell phone stores for help with phone.  Assuming it was the battery, I tried new batteries in the phone and the phone did not work.  This purchase costs me additiional monies in gas and battery investments.  After returning the phone, I received an email from the seller stating that the phone powered right up when they received it.  However, I know this is NOT true as I also took the phone to the corporate office of MetroPCS in my area and they could not power it up either.     This was a very disappointing purchase experience."	0
The phone looks and acts as if is brand new. I haven't had one issue with it thus far and I've had it for a couple of weeks now. All in all it was a good buy!	1
The phone looks as good as new. Got this for my dad who has trouble typing on touch screens because of shaky hands. Having the full keyboard helps him a lot. Great value for $50. Hooked it up with a $15/mo plan from Redpocket and works great.	1
The phone looks brand new and really looks and peroforms better than what I expected. Great buy for me.	1
"The phone looks good and the price is reasonable. The big problem is the phone was not unlock with sprint,still under contract in someone's name. I can not active the phone, so add to send it back."	0
The phone looks great and I love it!! It&apos;s a little confusing to use at first but once you get the hang of it you will fall in love. I also love the fact how I can use the internet as long as there is WIFI available.	1
The phone looks great!!!!!!! And it works great!!!!!!! Fast shipping!!!!!!!! Great price!!!!!!!! Great ebayer!!!!!!!!!                                                                                                                                                                                                             .	1
"The phone looks nice, but the storage is way below the 32gb advertised. I could not put it into service because it is lower than the current 8gb I'm using now."	0
"The phone looks thin and cute, yet the software is slow and different (not better though) from other Samsungs, which I found silly. Although the post said the phone was unlocked and would work with any network (I have Cingular - at&amp;t), I had several problems with texting. In particular, not all the messages I sent reached destination (the phone said message sent but the message was never received) and, viceversa, I did no receive some messages that were sent to me. I had to return the phone and am still waiting for refund.   I am pretty disappointed."	0
"THE PHONE LOOKS VERY NICE  BUT  IT DOESN&apos;T WORK PROPERLY. WHEN TALKING TO SOMEONE ON SPEAKER PHONE THE PERSON YOU ARE SPEAKING WITH HEARS THEIR OWN VOICE WHEN TALKING AND IT&apos;S VERY DESTORED. THE PHONE SHUTS OFF WHEN IT FEELS LIKE IT.   I BOUGHT IT BECAUSE OF THE FEATURES LOOKS, SOUND, TEXTING EASIER AND WAS TOLD IT WAS A VERY NICE PHONE..."	0
"The phone makes noises and calls out a list of numbers erratically while on or charging. Features are good but I paid $150 for the first one and the software on it died in less that a year. I was told that they are throw away's, when trying to have it repaired. When I bought another one I paid for a 2-year warranty, which I would highly recommend to anyone buying it. I bought the same model because it is the only 5"" screen available for Tracfone."	0
"The phone needed a new battery so I got one and the phone won&apos;t work, it turns off and then resets and it just keeps doing so"	0
"The phone never ""drops"" calls or do you have to shake it like some androids in order to view the screen that turns black. Love that companies like Tracfone can call this flip phone an ""upgrade"". Doesn't have wi-fi...and that's okay too! Sadly, it's basically now just a talk and/or text phone. None of the former features work anymore. You can receive emails though!  Mike Neenah, WI"	1
"The phone never got to me. Seller replied back here and there, but towards the end didn't really care about the fact that I didn't get my item. Now just waiting for my refund.  "	0
the phone never reached me the sender kept sending me fake tracking number...thanks to ebay i got the money back..	0
"the phone no its new is used, and no have code for desactived line very bad,the phone have line for nj."	0
The phone not what they said it is. very dispointed. Now i have a phone I can&apos;t use an contract that i have to pay for.	0
The phone only stays charged for one hour. The firm print recognition does not work. I cannot get apps. I tried calling the company I bought this from several times they will not return my call. Very disappointed	0
the phone overheats and the battery dies really fast.	0
"The phone powers on and importat phone functions work such as calling and messaging. The bad part is that alot of the apps such as the camera, gallery, google maps and others do not work at all. They just stop working."	0
"The phone received calls just fine, but the WIFI kept getting an error message everytime i tried to connect it to my wireless, but since Ive already bought a new phone, I decided to keep this phone for a backup."	0
"The phone says alltel on it but don&apos;t be fooled like I was. In my area Alltel was bought out by Verizon. I still have an Alltel plan but my carrier is Verizon. If I switch my plan to Verizon it will not be as good a deal as Alltel is. When I took the phone to have it activated, they said that it was not in their computer as a Alltel phone,even though it was a new phone that has never been activated. They will not be able to activate it. So I guess it is just an expensive paper weight. This says nothing about the quality of the phone, but it does have Alltel on the cover and when it is turned on it is on the screen also. I will check before I purchase a new phone next time!"	0
"the phone seemed to work well at 1st but became buggy, problematic. need something more reliable. returning."	0
THE PHONE SENT TO ME HAD WATER DAMAGE. DID NOT FUNCTION AT ALL. I STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED MY REFUND.	0
The phone should have had at least 8gb of ram. Simply downloading apps sometimes is a problem because there&apos;s not enough ram. The proccessor is slow and sluggish and the phone freezes a lot. I am very disappointed with LG and the phone(LG L9) is not up to my standards at all. I sent the phone back because it isn&apos;t a good phone.	0
the phone sometimes turns off and overheats its really slow it broke on me today and i warn you dont get this phone	0
The phone started having issues after 30 days. Phone battery didn't hold a charge . The phone shuts off after if it is 50% or less of a charge. It continues to glitch and beep. I told this to saler and he wasn't consistent with helping  to fix the problem.  Phone was suppose to be new. He stated that the battery might be bad. But never offered to send a new battery.  He sent a shipment label with a 24 hour expiration date and didn't inform me he was doing so. His communication was not the best. . So now I'm stuck with a phone that doesn't work. 	0
The phone stopped charging after 10 days. it is not clear whether it is a phone or a charger that is faulty.	0
"The phone sucked net 10 no longer makes it when we tried to activate for stepdaughter net10 could not activate..they said they would ship another phone never did so this deal sucked,,,"	0
the phone sucks would not buy from this person again. the phone did not work after it was charged. that is bad selling.	0

"The phone they sent me was stolen and had to be returned, which they most likely resent to someone else by now. However the phone cannot be activated with verizon wireless."	0
The phone took a charge 2times then would not turn on . The screen was pitted and crazed although it was advertised as having numbers and letters etched into iit was quite well used.	0
The phone turned off and wouldn't turn back on 30 days after we bought the phone. I bought 3 phones from the same seller at the same time...  ONE phone died about 30 days after purchasing and seller wouldn't do anything about it. I read some other comments and found out that this is not an uncommon occurence.  My other two phones have short battery life.  They charge all night and are dead before dinner.  I replaced the dead phone with a microsoft Lumia 640 bought directly at the ATT store with a ONE YEAR warranty for just about the same money that I spent on the Lumia 920... IT WORKS GREAT!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND GOING THAT ROUTE.... 	0
The phone turns off whenever. Seller not to trust.	0
"The phone vivid screen looks clear &amp; visible.  Keyboard is entirely different, easy too be used.  Thin, light"	1
The phone was a gift for my daughter.  I was a little scared because I didn&apos;t know how it would work before Christmas Day.  There were instructions from our phone carrier on how to set up services from phones purchased from EBAY. The set up from an existing phone to the new phone only took a few minutes.  The carrier had staff available on Christmas Day to help us with the set up.  My daughter loves the phone &amp; has had no trouble with its features.	1
The phone was a great value.  Picture quality is much better than my iPhone 5.  Its larger than expected but that is not a problem.	1
"The phone was a nice phone but verizon had upgraded their service and it was not downward compatable with older phones like the Samsung  Gleam. You can not down load ringtones, games or any other feartures. if you want just a basic phone with no features it is OK."	0
The phone was a purchase for my teenager.  He is very pleased with this phone. The seller shipped in a timely manner and product was just as described.	1
The phone was accurately described and came incredibly quick. It is a great phone and the extra 1 gig card is really nice.	1
"The phone was advertised as a pink phone when in reality, it is the charcoal color model. I had sent the seller an email saying if it was not pink, I did not want it if I won the bid. The seller did not even give me the courtesy of a reply to my question. I questioned the color because the pictures looked like it was the darker one but some of the other phones being sold by other sellers looked dark in some pictures but pink in others so I did not know what this one looked like. I strongly advise no one to buy from this seller ever.you don&apos;t know what you are going to get!"	0
The phone was all broken up  It looked like scratches in the pictures It works but its not worth having  Im sorry I bought it	0
"The phone was an upgrade from the Blackberry 8110 that my husband had. He loves the Curve as it is very similar to the previous blackberry&apos;s he has owned.He says the keyboard style keys make it easier for him to text and it is much faster too. The condition of the phone was mint and he is spending time customizing the icons, tones and screensaver to his liking. Overall he has had nothing negative to say about the phone and we&apos;ve had it a few days now. If you are looking to upgrade from an older Blackberry I would recommend this one."	1
"The phone was as described. Got here faster than I expected which was a big bonus, and overall a great seller that did not present any complications to the transaction."	1
The phone was attached to another contract and couldn&apos;t be activated by sprint. It would be kind of impossible to give you a overall rate because I found no use in it.	0
"The phone was beautiful and it was running smoothly for about a month when the problem started out of no where.  Problems:  1. It would not wake up until holding the power button for 30+ seconds and I had to do this several times a day. 2. On one day the phone shut down automatically and the notification indicator was running all colors of led light (white blue, green, red....) 3. Nothing can stop this and until it ran out of the battery. 4. Recharged the phone after the battery is depleted the same problems revive when the battery level was more then 50%  I googled the problems and found that many many customers had the exactly same problems, either long hold for the startup or light parade issues. I think Blackberry should recall this phone.  I was trying to contact Blackberry but could not get a hold of any human being. The system kicked me out after they found out my i.m.e.i number did not belong to their direct sale phones. While I was doing my last trial and entered wrongly the i.m.e.i number the computer could not recognize passed me to a ""LIVE"" person.   After long long conversation and many on-holds they finally said it was the ""hardware"" problem and I had to go back to my dealer to send back the phone. BLACKBERRY WOULD NOT DEAL WITH CUSTOMERS DIRECTLY UNLESS THEY BUY DI"	0
"the phone was bought for someone else, but she says that the sound quality and the picture quality can not be beaten, and she will only ever use razorv3 great compact phone"	1
"The phone was brand new and worked perfectly. I brought the phone for my grandmother, so I wanted something functional and not too complicated for her to use. She loves the phone and I have no complaint whatsoever. Thanks!!"	1
The phone was brand new just missing the charger ! I use this type phone and already had car and house chargers !	1
The phone was clean but no scratches but the SIM card doesn't work only can get 3G service so I'm a little disappointed 	0
"The phone was completely scratched. I would have returned it, but I was leaving the country, which was my mistake, of course. But it was not worth the money, despite the fairly cheap price. I couldn't change the language either. It was scratched, looked stolen, and didn't function properly. It was also promised, that there would be NO markings from previous use on the screen, but there was.   I regret buying it, and I regret not being able to return, too. Of course, the last bit was my own mistake. "	0
the phone was defective	0
The phone was defective. It worked for two days. Lesson learned: I will never buy a used phone again.	0
The phone was delivered promptly. It was a new product and they tore the plastic casing preparing to pack it  they checked with me before shipping to make sure that was OK. The phone is in great working condition  it is new and it arrived in a timely manner. Pleased with the product in the service	1
"The Phone was delivered the exact time that was stated. It came with charger,and it is a nice new iPhone. Great pricing, and I would defionitely order from this vendor again. Easy activation no issues at all! "	1
"The phone was described the way it looks in actual hand, the seller was fast and easy to work with, got the phone sooner than expected."	1
The phone was dirty and broken. It was advertised as fully flashed for Cricket and it was not. $40 that would have been better spent by flushing down the toilet. This purchase has made me leery of future online purchases.	0
The phone was even better then described and it came with a few extras will gladly deal with again! 	1
The phone was exactly as described on the site. However the phone was not deactivated nor did it come with the 4 digit pin for the buyer to get access to switch the phone over. This was not mentioned in the description. I e-mailed the seller to get the matter resolved. It has been 1 week since the normal turn around stated at least 2 days to hear back from the seller and I still not had a response to day.  This is bad business. I would not do business with this seller again.	0
The phone was exactly as described. The shipping was great and very fast! I received it before the actual date to arrive. I chose this phone because I needed one fast for my husband.	1
"The phone was exactly what I ordered at a good price and arrived much sooner than expected, even during the Christmas mailing season!!"	1
the phone was excellent. new in box as stated.i will buy from this seller again in the future. highly recommended.Motorola RAZR V3 (Unlocked)	1
The phone was for my son and he likes it alot it is very similar to the iPod touch so it works well for him. iOS is a great software for young and old.	1
"The phone was fully charged when i received it and it was a good phone.  There was no way to charge the phone after the battery had gottne low.  I even bought another charger but still nothing works.  I feel i got stuck with a bad deal which i thought was a good deal at first.  I&apos;ll never by anything like this product on ebay again.  I pent a lot of money for a product that i can not use.  I spoke my peace, but i know that nothing will be done about it.  Thanks for the opportunity."	0
"The phone was good, but one problem it didn&apos;t come with a sims card. And metro pcs don&apos;t make that phone anymore so they don&apos;t have the sims for it  so I wasted my money and had to buy an all new phone."	0
The phone was great but I realize that Huawei has a problem with batteries sometimes. This one doesn't hold it's charge well and dies at around 30-40%.	1
"The phone was hard to use, the touchscreen is very hard to manage since it seems to not record your taps correctly."	0
"The phone was horrible....look as if it had been kicked across the pavement several times..it also kept giving error message while attempting to get on internet, which we were never able to do and ended up buying a whole new phone"	0
"The phone was in Awesome shape, delivered promptly and at a great price.  It was a sprint phone and even had 'Sprint' as the carrier on the phone itself.  The only problem was that when I took ot to Sprint, The employees and I spend an hour plus trying to find out why it was not available for enabling.  I returned this phone and sourced a phone from another location. I was given a shipping label promptly, shipped it back and am waiting for a timely refund."	0
The phone was in excellent condition absolutely flawless.  Unfortunately upon friends delivering it to my overseas location. I found the phone unservicable. I contacted eBay seller & told me it was working before shipping.  ( sure  it was)  anyway due to no courier service able to ship back to them.  I'm stuck with a brick.  There's no compromise with eBay or the merchant.  Due to my circumstances.  I will never buy off eBay ever again as Amazon prime is selling this phone for $250.00 Brand new with warranty. Moral to the story pay extra get new unless you're in country at the time of receiving the items. 	0
"the phone was in excellent condition, and the seller was true to their word. I received the item just in time."	1
"The phone was in fine cosmetic condition. However, the screen replacement was faulty rendering the touchscreen erratic. The price perhaps reflects the high probability that 1) youall be purchasing the faulty phone I returned at a cost of $12 or 2) youll purchase another errantly repaired phone. Ask for the vendor to agree to a prepaid return for defects before you buy!"	0
"the phone was in good working condition having some problems on getting service it on it but I believe that is just metro way making more money off you. nice buying experirnce. mailed very quicklt and it will be another one to the moto I am collected up. thank you very much for your your time and may god bless your ways and paths.                         thanks,                                AK5"	1

The phone was like the one in the store except for a lot less!  Brand new and not even opened!	1
"The phone was listed as a Brand New Item When you buy a brand new item you should not expect the phone to have phone numbers already stored in the phone. This one had six numbers already programmed in the phone. The volume on the phone is not loud at all and, hard to hear it when it rings. The charger that came with the phone was not the correct one and, had to buy another one. Will not buy another phone from this person. Buyers should beware when listed as a brand new phone ..."	0

"The phone was not compatible to USA T-Mobile specifications for the Internet use nor did the TV work, the radio worked.

"The phone was not unlocked as desribed When Posted on Ebay. Also in the description these words were used (EXCELLENT CONDITION) and it looked nice however,  to me that would mean it has the most current O.S. (2.3.4.GINGERBREAD) which is offered by L.G. (Free) not an outdated O.S. that was on this phone. Its like selling a car with a new paint job but a worn out motor. He stated we don&apos;t deal with the O.S. I replyed don&apos;t advertise the item as Excellent Condition."	0

"The phone was purchased ""new, still in the box"".  The phone came in a box, without the user manual and came with a damaged screen.  The screen has black digital dots on it, the dots are both randomly scattered in single dots as well as in larger groups, making the screen partially visible. The phone is not as described nor does it reflect ""new, still in the box"".  Disappointed in my purchase.  I am using a ""new"" phone that came with damages. "	0
The phone was purchased for a friend to replace the battery on his phone.  He is delighted with the phone and it functions very well.  Fast delivery.	1

The phone was received in excellent conditions. Everything is perfect and works just the way I expected.	1
"The phone was refurbished not new as was indicated in the sale.  I took it to an independent repair place to find out why the internal speaker was not working today.  I was told that although the outside hardware was new, the internal workings were used.  I had to give him parts of my old Razr to repair the problem.  He determined that it was an old flex part that had worn out.  This was an unfortunate problem and would not be happening in less than two months if the part was new.  My old Razr worked with out any problems, with five years of long and hard use.  After this experience, I would never deal with this dealer again.  I consider it fraud to offer up an item for sale as new when it is used."	0
"The phone was reported ""lost or stolen"" a d is useless."	0
The phone was returned to the seller because the memory card wouldn't work. Seller gave a complete refund 	0
The phone was shipped right away.  I had no problems  getting it programmed - clean ESN number.  Would buy from this seller again! The phone is exactly  what the seller said it was.	1
"The phone was slow to ship (Seller waited 2 days) the iPhone was not as described.  It was listed with cracks on the back but Seller didn&apos;t mention a huge chunk of the back top corner (near camera) was completely gone!  Also the charger provided was a disgrace!  Missing the housing and the metal inside was completely smashed on both sides (wish I could attach a photo)....AND DOESN&apos;T WORK, no surprise with the condition it was in.  I should have listened to my gut and went with an EXPERIENCED SELLER.  Lesson learned!"	0
"the phone was sold to us in fair condition, but when it got to us it was in way better shape than advertised. all we had to get was a new battery, and us cellular  gives those away free. PHONE IS TOP NOTCH AND WE WILL BE BUYING AGAIN."	1
The phone was stolen and doesn't work it's blacklisted and locked up I'm waiting on a refund asap	0
The phone was supposed to be unlocked.  It was not and was therefore useless to us.  We had to replace with a new one while we were in Europe.	0
The phone was too old to be connected with my carrier.	0
The phone was use is not new  Does not have a label on the front of the phone and it has fingerprint of the back of the phone. I did contact with the seller he told it is brand new but he checked out before he send it. Which that mean the phone was one not new. but the seller told me its a new and he used to check the phone before he send it to the customer  when I turn on the phone. the phone does not ask me about the description like  fingerprint or password or gmail.  I dont know why he lied to me by saying new.	0
The phone was used for only a week and the logic card died/burned out. Phone look great but maybe was previously damaged.	0
"The phone was very thick, screen small even when open, also not very clear or sharp. tried several times to send picture message, and was never able to. Also could not retrieve picture messages. It would never connect to the web, would always &quot;time out&quot;. Try the LG420 flip phone from TRACFONE for $19.99. You&apos;ll be much happier!"	0
"The phone was very used.  I want to the US cellular to have it turned on and they said it had otten wet.  Within a week it no longer works.  Buyer beware, used is used."	0
The phone was very worn and it completely quit working after I had it for 3 days.  You couldn&apos;t turn the volume up at all.  This phone was obviously defective and therefore that was the reason for a no return on the purchase.	0

"The phone was what I wanted but there were functionality issues. It would constantly restart 5-6 times in a row. Also, processor would stop responding as well as a lot of the apps. The company was on top of offing to replace or refund so that was amazing for them to stand behind their products. I just wish the phone would have worked."	0
"the phone was without the ability to unlock. It is put on the black list, and actually in general a useless purchase. the seller promised to unblock, but after the promise, stopped responding to the letters"	0
the phone wasnt bad just the seller i bought it from he sent it broke an the wrong charger an he wouldnt give me my money back until i left good feedback	0
the phone wasn't payed off and the seller payed the last month so I got it and got service on it and about 3 weeks later it became black listed and worthless as a phone 	0
"The phone we received was not compatible with our service area. I have been trying all month to contact this vendor through email to return the phone, but I have yet to receive a response."	0
"The phone when recieved did not accomidate our cell carriers frequency. Bought in early Janaury 2008, returned February, still trying to get our money back from PayPal and seller. Bad experience."	0
The phone will not hold charge long. When I put it on the charger it charge down instead of charging up. I'm very disappointed !	0
The phone will only make emergency call. ?? Not Good.	0
"The phone wont accept my number.  Totaly bummed out because it was just a waste!  The phone it&apos;s self wasn&apos;t so bad, I just wish it woild work."	0
THE PHONE WORK AFTER I CHARG IT  SO THERE WAS NOTING WRONG WHITH IT  THANK YOU GOOD DEAL IM USING IT NOW	1
"the phone worked about 2 weeks then the display started turning white occasionally. But it worked still okay until 4 weeks later, not only the display but the audio completely shut."	0
The phone worked fine and then stopped working after a week.  Unfortunately i had already left positive feedback for the seller.	0
"The phone worked for 4 days, and died. The charger would not re-charge the phone. Once I got the phone and open the back, the battery was wet. I knew then it wasn&apos;t going to work for long. Bad experience and there&apos;s nothing to do about it. Not likely to buy from Ebay for a long time. My overall experience  was less than a one star."	0
"The phone worked for one week then start to restart by it self and the down arrow not working anymore, it was a bad deal for me."	0
"The phone worked perfectly, and only took about four minutes to activate through Verizon. I will admit I was somewhat skeptical, but this is the only way to go and I will never get a phone from the phone company again."	1
"The phone works but but good bit going on the battery is very poor dies completely in under 30 minutes, charging is poor even with fast charger take about 4hrs to 5 for fully. And it was hard to get connected to my service but it work........"	0
The phone works excellent I love it 	1
The phone works fine but had cosmetic damage it shouldn't have. It was stated to be brand new! It clearly was not! 	0
"The phone works fine, didn&apos;t come with a charger (no big deal) but the issue I had was that the phone was a Christmas gift for my niece and when we attempted to swap phones with Virgin Mobile, we were informed that the original owner still had the phone under his name so we were unable to use the phone with my niece&apos;s account. I had contacted the seller and he reminded me of the &quot;as is&quot; policy..that wasn&apos;t what I was inquiring about. It was the fact that the original owner still had the phone under his acct so no one can use the phone until he cancels the acct or the company releases the phone due to non-service..which I doubt will happen. I even called the home phone number still set up on the phone (yeah, when you sell a phone to someone, it should come with no personal information of the original owner, which included, home phone number, text messages, and pictures). That was in poor taste and I will NEVER EVER purchase from that seller EVER AGAIN! It&apos;s not difficult nor time consuming to make sure an item you are selling is wiped of all previously used information and can actually be used by the new owner. It&apos;s pretty pointless to have a phone given to you that you can&apos;t even use in the way a phone is made to be used: talking!"	0
"The phone works fine. What I don&apos;t like, and would never buy another is that AT&amp;T had stopped manufacturing this phone. If I had know that, I would never had bought."	0
the phone works great	1
"The phone works great sometimes its a little slow but i think its because of cydia, what i payed for it it was definitely worth it. good phone"	1
The phone works great! Received very quickly.	1
The phone works great. 	1
The phone works great. Just like the seller had promised. Still enjoying my LG Shine! Wonderful experience with seller.	1
The phone works like new & the edge screen has all my friends with iPhones jealous.	1
The phone works really well I'm really glad with my phone the phone came on time and everything came in well worked.	1
the phone works well but after i left a bad review beceause it took so long to get the seller left a bad review on my ebay and than asked me to remove mine and they would give me my money back well if you do good bus. in the first place you would not have to worrie about bad reviews and if you get them just try to do better next time	0
The phone works well.	1
"the phone works, it does what I need it to the battery life is a little short.  it has limited capabilities and the software is rather old android 2.1.3"	1
The phone would have been great if it wasn't reported LOST or STOLEN when I tried to activate it with Virgin Mobile.. so it is unusable.. 	0
"the phone would not accept my cingular sim card. come to know it was a older make for the old AT&amp;T, NOBODY&apos;S FAULT REALLY!"	0
"The phone would not work in my area.The seller said he would send my money back if I sent the phone back, I sent the phone back a month ago, I still have not recieved my money. I will not buy another one and I suggest that the next person that wants one to check with their network provider before purchasing one."	0
"the phone you sent me was not the tracfone w370the phone you send me was w376///the 2 phones look the same but are not....I DID ALOT OF RESEARCH BEFORE FINDING NTHE W370////THIS IS THE TYPE OF PHONE I WANTED...I CANNOT USE THE CHARGER BECAUSE THE CHARGER YOU SENT ME IS NOT FOR THE W370 BUT FOR THE W376...SO I PULLED THE BATTERY FROM THE PHONE W376 BECAUSE THIS IS THE ONLY BATTERY THAT CAN BE USED FOR W370....BECAUSE THE COST WAS SMALL I DID NOT FEEL THAT RETURNING THE W376 TO YOU WOULD ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING.. IT WAS TO BE A BACKUP FOR THE CELL I HAVE///BECAUSE THE DIFFERENCES ARE SMALL BUT IMPORTANT I ORDERED ANOTHER W370 FROM ANOTHER SELLER, WHO WENT ABOVE AND BEYOND &amp; CONTACTED ME  RE THE W370 AND HIS SUPPLIES ON HAND////THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME &amp; EFFERTS"	1
"The phone&apos;s functionality is exactly what I was looking for.  It&apos;s still in great condition minus a few minor cosmetic blemishes, but that&apos;s easily ignored.  Shipping was fast and everything seems to be in working order.  Lack of manual would be slightly bothersome IF my previous phone wasn&apos;t the latest model of this phone."	1
"The phone(a gift)was shipped to the billing address not the delivery address and  it had been opened. The seller did put a note explaining that someone wanted the the ESN # so they could verify the phone was clean, he opened the phone and broke the seal on the packaging. I now have pay to reship the phone to the address I submitted and it will not be there in time for my nephew&apos;s birthday. The seller did at least send in out as soon as he received payment, to bad it went to the wrong state.   As to the phone being opened it does appear to be a new phone and has no damage but he should have told whoever asked that he could not give them the number since the phone was being sold as new &amp; unopened."	0
"The phone(s) worked fine for a month or so then simply slowly died function by function to the point of being all but useless. This is not a criticism of the product, but rather of used units in general. Of 3 purchased the one that still works came from a garage sale. My own thought is that they generally died of crud infiltration (bad seals?) and worn out contacts that work sometimes. Moral? You pays your money and takes your chances. Feeling lucky today?"	0
"The phones are great. They work with Metro PCS and were in really good condition, though one phone had a few small but deep scratches on the screen, These scratch are not visible when the screen is on and backlit. All in all, I am very pleased with the phones and how quickly they arrived. "	1
The phones don't have chips in then for use in the Carribbean.	0
The phones great!	1
"The phones looks great, I have no idea about the battery life because haven't used it yet, doesn't have any charger to charge it, also want to know if is okay to use outside of the USA, I travel very often thats why I wanted an unlocked phone. "	0
"The phones seem like they might be god once I am finally able to activate it. ""Best"" Buy apparently dropped the ball and didn't scan the phones before shipping so the SIM cards will not activate. Now I have to jump through hoops to get them up and running. Good Phone just buy it from a decent seller."	0
The phones speaker sucks and it has a broken screen. I wouldn't buy from them again EVER!!!!!! 	0
"the photos did not correspond to the article sent, the product was hit and scratched "	0
The physical damage was horrible and it wouldn't stay charged more then an hour!!	0
"the picture listed on ebay was way too good for the phone sent to me. The seller sent me another housing, but still all scratched. Very good customer service though."	0
"The picture on the phone stopped working so it is useless to me. I can not see who I am calling, etc."	0
the pictures u have are two different phones!!!	0
"The pig/pigs who mailed the product in such a bad condition should be removed from ebay as a seller ! The battery was at a zero level, no juice/charge - why ? The item was dirty and some one's hair was in the product ! The paint job on the product has come off bit by bit. The screen has scratches on it - yet it is described as otherwise. What is that bad smell on the product ? Buyers beware !"	0
"The Plastic side Broken after 1 day, without falling down!!!   i can not found the metal side accessories from this phone!!!   Company Doogee don't answer!!!   This Smartphone is fail!!!"	0
The post office put it in the wrong slot They told to file a claim	0
The power button to turn on the phone came out won't turn on at all 	0
"The price is nice.  The charger does not stay connected, so I have had to use a spare.  The phone was shipped while still on, and was setup such that all the menus were in Spanish."	1
"The price seemed too good to be true.  But when I received the unit I realized that the manufacturer provided no credible evidence that using this cell phone, and especially its non-standard browser, would not expose me to significant privacy risks.  The browser shipped with the unit required access to all of the personal data I might put onto the machine (e.g., contacts and email).    There was no assurance that all of my information as well as all of my browser communications (including passwords I would use to access protected websites) would not, without my knowledge or permission be sent back to China.  So, I do not use this phone.  "	0
"The price was excellent. All information about the phone was correct, and the price was wonderful.!!!!!!"	1
"the price was great,shipping always to high but seller always because of ebay fees are up they have to charge more now"	1
the price was to low so I shouldn't be suprised when I never received the order. It's a Samsung so I'm reasonably sure they'ed have been great.	0
"The problem is I lost after 4 days received it , sad story"	1
The processor on these notes is horrible.  Slowest cell phone ever made.  My wife hates this so bad I had to buy another.  Battery is okay.  I tried all the apps to see if it could speed up but nothing worked.  DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE if you are one who is used to fast phones.	0
the product arrived incomplete and I tried to communicate with them with 3 email and did not communicate with me	0
The product arrived on time and in good condition and exactly as the seller described. Thank you. Would buy from this seller again..	1

The product came exactly as represented. I downloaded an instruction manual from the web and I was off on my maiden voyage as a &apos;smart phone&apos; user. I would buy this product again and I would purchase from this seller again; it was a positive experience.    jhk	1
The product came in great condition however it roamed endlessly even though I was in my local area.  Many times I wasn&apos;t able to use it as if service was not available.  I took it to a Sprint Repair shop for testing and they replaced it.  I don&apos;t know what the source of the problem actuality was the phone or the carrier.	0
The product described did not work at all and I have to return it	0
The product description is clear. Great seller	1
"The product did not work and the ebay store, A-1 Cellular, did not make the product good as was specified in the seller&apos;s warranty. Neither the phone nor the seller, A-1 Cellular, are reliable for business. The phone, like any electronic component, may be defective or mistreated but there is no excuse for the mistreatment of customers in business transactions. The LG5450 was sent back for exchange; however, the seller will not acknowledge receipt of the phone eventhough the US Post Office confirmed delivery and the Confirmation Delivery number was sent to the seller. E-Bay should revoke trading rights!"	0
"The product didn&apos;t work, But that wasn&apos;t my worst problem, contacting the resolution center!! First you spend a couple of hours on the computor chating  to no prevail, then they send you to e-mail which they dont answer, they dont have an 800 number to call to talk to a &quot;person&quot; I&apos;ve been trying to get a refund back for 2 weeks now and still nobody answers my e-mails!!! I&apos;ve been in the chat room several times with the same old run around!! Its  been nothing but a nightmare!!! I know money doesn&apos;t mean any thing to them, but it does to me!!!! And I cant get mine back from them!!!"	0
The product from the seller is in mint condition. The phone itself is great. 	1
The product has lot of scratches. The charging cable is not working and also it is not the original one. The screen also has some marks on it. Overall highly dissatisfied from the product	0
The product heats up immensely while taking for more than 40 min. Its scary that it may explode anytime. Also this seems to be a refurbished phone even though the seller quoted it as New. On arrival there were marks on the phone that indicated this is not a New phone.	0
The product I got is from Verizon instead of AT&T. The seller won't admit that it's possible.  The baseband gone after upgrade to Android 8. eBay won't provide any resolution that makes sense.	0

"The reason I decided to buy it, was the price. When I got the phone, I tried to activate it. Virgin moble said it belonged to someone already. I contacted the seller told him. He first said send it back or keep it and he would give some of the money back. I told him why in the world would I keep it, I can not use it. The phone company said that the seller was not the owner. I told the seller, all he had to do was have the owner call and cancel the contract. He told me a cilent/friend had given him the phone. I just wonder why, he did not have that person call. Anyways I returned the phone and got a full refund/shipping. The seller asked me not to leave a neg. review. I thinks that is wrongh. The seller has his reviews blocked so you can not read them. I think that is unfair to the buyer. I do not know why ebay has done such a thing. I might not have had to go through all of that, if I could of read his reviews. I am not happy with all this."	0
The reception on this phone is phonominal.  Well made. Very clear and exceptional volume . Not many bells and whistles just a solid basic phone . 	1

The Samsung Galaxy Appeal SGH I827 is a ATT GO PHONE I contacted ATT and they informed me that this phone cannot be unlocked contrary to seller&apos;s claim.  I was planning on using it with my SIMPLE wireless plan but was not able to. I also was unable to use it overseas.	0

"---The Samsung Intensity 2, has some good and bad features, as average as any other phone.---     -----Some of the GOOD features of the phone:      `The full slide out QWERTY keyboard, for fast/solid ABC messaging and e-mail....Allow quick punctuation and proper grammar; no mandatory data contract. It has a handy search and navigation extras. User-configurable display can be made easy to read.allow quick punctuation and proper grammar; no mandatory data contract. It has a nice compact design. The eco-conscious construction is a plus, Has and excellent battery life. It has a Internal Display Size of 2.2 Inches, and a overall body design size of 4.51 x 2.87 x 0.10. Got it online with my upgrade only had to pay $50.    -----Some of the BAD features of the phone:      `The navigation keys are a little cramped, number pad makes it easy to miss-dial. The 2.5 millimeter headset jack is inconvenient, you can&apos;t download music directly to the phone, and the call quality could be better I dropped a call in the first few hours of use. When I would lock the phone and put it in my pocket, I found out that if I would move or bend over(doing the usual stuff at work)...The phone would become unlocked and I would be dialing, and calling people I didn&apos;t even know. When it comes to texting on the front keys are really small, then when your continuing and decide to switch to QWERTY keyboard you can&apos;t just text right a way you have to press the middle button and do other stuff.....JUST A WASTE OF TIME. You can&apos;t press the send/ pick up button on the phone to send a message you have to press the center button press &apos;SEND&apos; the select &apos;OK&apos;. Just to much to do when I want to send a quick text message.    -----Bottom Line:      `Only buy if you have really small finger and like a small and compact phone. The Samsung Intensity II is a good midrange phone for teens, thanks to its various social networking and communications tools. While there are some drawbacks, the moderate price is a steal."	0
The Samsung is a great phone and the slider feature is great. It had come precharged and transferring data was easy. The Samsung Intensity II is a good value for the price.	1

The screen barely works (or works when it wants to). There&apos;s so much wrong with this phone it would take way too long to write about. We&apos;ve only had it for two months and the screen gets fuzzy constantly like a snowy TV channel. Don&apos;t buy this piece of SH**!	0
The screen did not work after short time	0
The screen froze up And had to take to Apple store and end up paying more than I paid for the phone to replace 	0
The screen had pixel burns and and black mark on the screen . The seller was supposed to mail me a return label but never mailed it . He insisted that he emailed a return label and that I have to print it. Will not be buying from this seller anymore. 	0
The screen has a rather large crack but doesn't seem to affect it performance.  Otherwise it is an excellent phone! 	0
"The screen in front broke a couple of weeks after we got it.  We didn&apos;t drop it or do anything, it just stopped working like someone had stepped on it or something.  Other than that it works fine."	0

"The second sim slot  in this mobile operates on 2g which has been completely shut down in countries such as Australia, Japan & Singapore with more to follow.  The first sim slot will work on 3g but if you put a sim card in the second sim slot, you will see a message which says no service.  I have sent seller a message but no response.  I recently got scammed by a seller with this very model.  For the record it was not with this seller but am now on a mission to prevent others from the same fate.  If sellers advertise on Australias ebay site they cannot call a mobile a dual sim if it cannot operate as a dual sim in Australia.  At the very least they need to explain in their description that sim slot number two works on 2g and cannot operate in Australia or other countries where it is obsolete."	0
The selfie camera has a ton of dust in front of the lens but under the glass. So all selfies are obscured a little. For a phone that is supposed to have fantastic cameras this is a huge let down.  I would assume this was a phone with a cracked screen that was replaced without much quality control.	0
The sellar say he went to Apple with the phone and they say it was just the connection from the screen detach but it was mor truhn that. It seems to be a hardware problem 	0
"the seller advertised a unlocked phone, When I received it, not only was it not unlocked, It was listed as lost or stolen. When I contacted him he said &quot;too bad, you can&apos;t return it. I got paypal involved and then he said &quot; if you send it back I will refund the money&quot;. I sent it back and he won&apos;t return my money. He is a thief.

However, the cell phone wasnt met the criteria of excellent condition by EBAY.The photo was not original  even the color was different.

"The seller claims to be a new unused, never activated off the iPhone6-64GB Apple phone system, but the actual description I received phone completely inconsistent with the seller. First, I received after checking its basic features and settings, but it is a 32GB Android phone system. Second, the phone's serial number can be modified freely. But the real Apple phone serial number is unique and can not abuse. Third, the basic settings in the phone's serial number and the serial number on the back of the fuselage and the serial number on the packaging, three serial numbers completely three different alphanumeric combinations, three simply can not match. Thus, the seller sold me was not a genuine Apple phone, with the seller's terms of sale completely inconsistent."	0
The seller contacted me and let me know the phone was not functional properly before I paid and cancelled my bid. I appreciate the honesty and the thoughtfulness to check everything before shipping. Kind of bummed I didn't get a working phone. But appreciate good people more then the phone 	1

"The seller had already tried, unknown to me, to sell this phone before.  BUT since it was a STOLEN phone, the previous buyer returned to seller. I found this out only because all the previous shipping labels were still attached to the box I received.  Thought I was being smart and paid through Pay Pal, but after lodging a &quot;fraud&quot; complaint with PayPal after checking with with both Verizon and Cricket who said they would ABSOLUTELY NOT activate this phone, Pay Pal &quot;denied&quot; my claim.  EBAY and PAYPAL are nothing more than fronts for organized criminal activity!!!  BEWARE!!!   STAY AWAY!!!!"	0
The seller has gone way beyond to accommodate my needs I recommend their service 	0
The seller has not shipped the item on time as promised  and on top of it he has cheated the customer by describing wrongly  and the source of the item is unknown(stolen I guess since he could not provide the receipt from where he bought it) Tried to close the case by offering partial amount. Do not trust this seller. Ebay need to read all this info and make a decision 	0
The seller haven't with the EBay requirements for transaction. I end up cancelled deal with seller	0

I will never do business with this person again and encourage others to stay away!"	0
"the seller is not replain back after my complaing very desapointed!!i message couple of times not hear back,horrible not good!!!"	0
"The seller is one of the best in my humble opinion. The pho for the price is one of the best. Don't hesitate to buy it, you won't regredit."	1
"The seller is too clever to take responsibility and Ebay were equally easy prey for his hunting skills, no help. The phone was not factory unlocked. Rooted device and he got away with it. I'm moving Amazon from now on. This should not have been tolerated. I'm disappointed that the guy twisted my facts and sold Ebay the results! "	0
"The seller is very tricky about there cell phone products that I choose to buy it now. First, I ask for the tracking number within two days after I choose to buy it now. No respones from the seller after the transaction was close. Than, I go online to check on the shipping status of my phone and there system shows its in transit with no tracking number availble. Than, I decided to logon to the seller site and contacted them by using there other ebay listings and they told me the items were in back order and there was no delivery dates. The seller ask me to cancel order because there is no delivery date and no inventory. Buyers be aware of the seller unable to fulfill your order and with no shipping tracking status availble."	0

I was unable to use the serial # or sim # to assist me in doing so.  The phone should have come with a card for 300 minutes, which it didn&apos;t."	0
The seller made fast transactions and the product was as advertised in great shape and functional. I would recommend others to purchase products from this seller.	1
The seller needs to ensure the phone properly works before selling. The seller promptly accepted my return and refunded my money but I was a week without a phone.	0

The seller sent me a email on Friday with the tracking number indicating that the item had been mailed out that day.  Two days later on Sunday the seller notifies me that the item was damaged while packing it so payment had to be refunded.  So clearly the seller had not sent out the item on Friday as the email statement.    To add insult to injury Paypal refuses to refund my money immediately.  They provide the seller with an immediate credit into their account but they don&apos;t do the same in the reverse.	0

DO NOT TRUST THIS SELLER!!! I requested an immediate refund. "	0
"The seller states in the sale posting - &apos;factory unlocked&apos; - BULL!    He sent me a locked phone with &quot;SIM network unlock PIN&quot; message right the minute I turned it on after getting it out of the box - This is a complete ripoff. Imagine my disappointment.    I do not understand how this seller got high review, I definitely would not buy anything from them ever again.    Needless to say, my complaint (which is quite severe, if I might add) is not yet important enough to get his reply.    Two words for you prospect buyers - Stay away!"	0

"The seller was excellent and no complaints on purchase, shipping and receiving product. and LG Phone activation was easy and straight forward.  However, the net 10 service in our North San Luis Obispo county was below average to poor as compared to my previous service.  Many dropped calls or could not even make or receive calls due to coverage limitations.  My other verizon service worked much better and I was trying the Net 10 to consider switching as it is a bit cheaper.  However, the savings is not worth the poorer service.  Net 10 needs to improve their coverage in this area."	0
"The seller was great , fast shipping and everything I expected. The only con is the battery dies fast but that's because I'm always into my phone ....great phone bought it like it was new"	1
"The seller was great,  the phone has sprint carrier and it just wouldn&apos;t work.  It was not reliable.  My fiance would try to call me from work and on his way home and it would drop calls or just wouldn&apos;t work"	1
The seller was misleading in saying this phone was fully functionable! the phone came half falling apart and turns on and off. This product does not in fact work properly at all!!!!!!!!!!!	0
The seller was rude and refused a return on a bad phone. .....	0
"The seller was truthful and pleasant to deal with.  But it doesn&apos;t stop there.  The phone is so much better than my last one.  From now on I shop eBay for a phone replacement first even when I am offered a free one.  Secondly it will be an LG.  I am almost glad that I ruined the last Samsung to get this good deal on a terrific phone.  The keyboard is excellent, love the overall size of the phone and the features are perfect.  I even like the orange case.  And I am hard to please.  The only negatives, the outside screen is small, and the speaker button is on the inside as part of the qwerty keyboard instead of outside to be used as a phone.  But those do not deter my enjoyment of this phone."	1
"The seller was very fast with communication. The phone was in the perfect condition that was described. It was shipped very fast. I'm really enjoying this phone and I want to thank the seller for getting it to me so quickly. Great product, great seller."	1
The seller was very responsive to all of my questions and the T-Mobile sidekick arrived super fast and was in perfect condition. He even wrote me to find out it I was satisfied with the item. Very cordial and courteous seller. I would definetly do business with him again. I highly recommed him to anyone.	1
The seller was very understanding to the fact i no longer wanted the item and let me off the hook. And that is a great deal to me. Seeing that I&apos;m a first time buyer and i couldn&apos;t be more grateful for that.	1
"The seller will not consult the safest way of delivery the package to Venezuela, the phone was stolen at customs in Venezuela, I was notified and I warned the seller. The package was insured UPSP, and they promised me collect the insurance, and send me a new phone through a shipping company safer, such as DHL or FEDEX. After 3 months they did not come to contact me or sent me the replacement phone or my money back."	0
"The Seller wrote that the phone was 2 weeks old and in like new condition.  when I received the phone after 3 weeks, I noticed scratches on the keypad and outer camera lens trim."	0
"The seller, was very helpful. He made accommodations with me on the price. The person was very friendly and being able to work with me on the price."	1
The service from the seller was great the product was brand new it came with a contract this seller gets 5 stars all around. i highly reccomend this seller.	1
The service was ok and it came a day early witch was nice but the only thing that wasn't very nice was that they sent me the wrong provider. It said sprint but when I went to go activate it they said it was not registered with sprint. 400$ for nothing. thanks 	0
The set showed signs of moisture damage because earpiece was rusted and fell out as soon as I removed protective plastic from flip. Also less than 48 hrs of receiving the set it stopped charging. Not able to accessing the web due to outdated software on the set that can&apos;t be updated. Altogether these sets are too old to be on the market to be sold as useable.	0
"The shipping came a day early, but the product was unsatisfactory. I would've just paid 10 or 20 more dollars to get better one if I knew the condition was like this. Screen has a little crack and space. I understand used phone's wear and tear. However, this is too much. "	0
"The shipping was super fast, and the extras were great. The phone basically is a piece of blahh. I guess the battery isn&apos;t a right fit or maybe the sim holder is bent in such a fine way that it doesn&apos;t read it. I&apos;ll answer and it freezes. I&apos;ll be talking and the call drops if I get call waiting. I tried deleting everything on the memory card and that didn&apos;t help.  Point of this rambling is they sold be a defective item and now I don&apos;t have a phone until december. I know whaaaaa whaaaa. Beware!!!"	0
The shipping was very fast. I received the item within few days only.	1
The shuttle phone has some pretty bad features. You cannot switch the speakerphone on or off during a call. You have to turn speakerphone on BEFORE you receive a call. Like I have ESP or something to know when I will get calls. And you cannot turn off the speakerphone during a call. This one is even worse. You will be bumped out of an existing call if someone else calls you during your call and the phone switches automatically to the new call without you touching anything. I am very disappointed in these features and will just use this phone for a while until i can get rid of it.	0
The Sidekick is an awesome phone very easy t use and does everything I needed it to do.  I am very happy with it and I like the fact that it has a big screen and the phone is durable and heavy I really think it i just what I wanted and am VERY Satisfied with it.	1

The SIM card is bad. Straight talk is sending me another one. So I'm not able to enjoy my new phone for another 4-7 days. Might want to look into this an see if it's an issue. First time I've got a bad one. Thanks.	0
"The size is great for men&apos;s pockets! I don&apos;t like to wear it on my belt. The text size is also great when you&apos;d need to have reading glasses cause you control the size of your incoming text, very useful. The camera is 3.2 mgp, good for the price."	1
The sliding keyboard doesn't work so well and there are scratches all over the item not worth 35$!!!!	0
"The smartphone looks and behaves like new.  When I first turned it on, it took me through menus that you might only see when first activating a phone, like asking me what language I wanted it to display.  The case, screen and everything else about it looked new.  I have not had any problems with its performance.  This was a more cost-effective purchase than buying a later model, like the Galaxy S9."	1
the sony ericsson S500i is the best phone cause of its small figure and it has like four colors. the green is like the best one out of all of them.	1

The speaker is the most terrible one that I have ever had. I don't recommend this phone. I wish I returned it right away.  	0
The speaker system does not work on the phone. Contacted Sony and ran the repair script but it did not fix the issue. The issue is more hardware. The phone only works with Earphone.	0

"The support is terrible for Verykool devices. There is no phone support listed on their website, even for technical, only email which is alarming because phone are electronic devices that may encounter problems and they are not cheap items, can go up to over $200! When writing to them I was told you can find it on facebook but there are more than 11 facebook pages and if you are not a member, you'll have the hassle of joining and when you get to their location page, they only have cities NO street address. There is a cell phone accessories Amzer with items under $10 where you can contact them by phone, email, live chat, facebook AND they post their address if you want to snail mail them! Do you REALLY want to buy a phone where it's VERY difficult to find a way to talk to them on the phone???  This is a criticism of the manufacturer NOT the seller!"	0

"The telephone was filthy. True, it was a used phone but it could have been cleaned. However, my experience with the seller was great. I returned the product and received full credit."	0
"The thing I like about this unlocked phone is the price, and the fact that I can use my old sim card from another provider. Check with the seller first I have a T-Mobile sim card this is a unlocked At&amp;T phone and it works great with a prepaid provider."	1
The title says it all i love my phone =)this guy is a man of his word and he came through i have had my phone for like 2 weeks and i am VERY satisfied wit my product =D	1
"the toch screen is very dificulty to use, unlocked phone loss the diferent aplication for my company, i use the phone as normal phone"	0
The touch screen did not work properly and went out in less than 2 weeks.  We contacted the seller to get it resolved and was told that the phone was only warrantied for 2 days.  They refused to do anything about it.	0
the touch screen is difficult to use the buttons are too close together. i would not recommend this product to anyone.	0
the touch screen should be push harder to work.it is far from iphone where ou could touch slightly and it respond immediately.	0
the touchstone charging system quit working after 3 days and then the phone frozed up after 6 days.would not reccommed to nobody.	0
"The tracking information said that the item has been delivered in the mailbox, but I did not see it in my mailbox.I need clear information about it, or my money back."	0
the transaction was done quickly and painlessly.  the actual item sucks. I wish i had read the ad better because i can&apos;t even  use this item.  I guess that&apos;s where the buyer beware fhrase comes in.   There was full disclosure though. I just didn&apos;t read it well.	1
"the transaction was positive, the item came in in good like-new condition, and shipping was reasonable.  thank you."	1
"The turbo charge adapter did not work, but the seller was willing to replace it.  The battery life was not equivalent to the first one that I bought.  Also the fact that the battery is not replaceable gives the phone a life span of appx 3 years.  I liked the first Droid Turbo I bought. The battery life was great, but as it got older it deteriorated.  The price is fair,, but you have to figure that the phone needs to be replace when the battery deteriorates.  If you are into buying the latest and greatest that is no problem, but I am in the buy and hold until it no longer works."	0
the two htc diamont was that what I see. But the problem is that I&apos;m ask the seller and he lie me. I am ask is those phone have a sim card slot. The seller answer me that they do have. When I  receive it I see they haven&apos;t slot for sim card. But anyway this is good phone. htc always do very nice phones.	0
"The unit has been great. It's speedy, has a lot of storage, and most important replaced 2 phones.  The camera on it is great.  It takes photos inside and out equally well.  I have not figured out how to take a good outside, low light, long distance photo (moon).  Once I got it set up, it is very simple to use, and access the programs I use most frequently.  There is a lot of choices (bloatware) from Samsung and Google that provide options for customization.  This is my first Android phone, so it has taken some time to sift through the necessary notifications and programs that are most helpful to me.  The screen is amazing with great detail.  One of the primary reasons I bought the phone was the use of the stylus, and Samsung offers straight forward apps to optimize it's usage.  I am using many Microsoft apps since I use this for work and home.  I am using this device more as I set It up as required.  I have no regrets purchasing the device, although it is somewhat amazing it costs as much as a desktop or notebook computer."	1
The usb (charging) port is used and dirty inside. its  probably refublished	0
"The used Nokia 6085 started out ok for a used phone, but only had it a couple of months when I could no longer text on it.  Wanted an inexpensive phone like the one I had before to last till I decided on carrier to stay with.  Can still use to phone, but not text.  Guess i got what I paid for, but had hoped it would last me bit longer.  I won&apos;t buy another used phone, maybe refurbished"	0
"The V10 is the first phone I enjoyed using, thus this was my 3rd LG V10. At $195 this was a steal since it still ~$230 2nd hand on Amazon. Even though mine drowned during a river hike, it reincarnated without audio some weeks later. The 2nd one was purchased for my wife and the 3rd one was for my father in law. I've now converted 2 former phonophobes to the religion of staring down while twiddling thumbs that most of the world seems to love.  This phone arrived on time and was in immaculate condition (new). The OEM charger wasn't included, however the after-market charger supported LG's fast charging. A pair of extremely cheap headphones were also included, we used it to ensure that the audio port was working."	1
The vedio camera not sharp and clear enough when use for vedio call.	0
"The very best phone in the world!!!!!!!!!! I have 9 phones and one day I got that one out and used it 5 days and my mother-in-law saw it and offered me twice what I paid for it, now I wish I had not sold it for any price."	1
"The very name itself; ""trust certificates "", more than implies trust. It is crazy to think this product comes with expired trust certificates that were expired before the phone was manufactured. Any seller whom deals in this type of stuff is absolutely NOT to be trusted.  THIS COMPANY IS A SCAM AND DO NOT BUY DO NOT VIEW DO NOT COMMUNICATE AT ALL. THROW YOUR MONEY IN THE TRASH"	0
The volumbe button dosent work i felt so bad cause it was a gift for my mom and wen she told me that something is wrong with the volume button i felt bad cause she was so excited and it came defective	0
The volume control often does not work...  and sometimes the #2 does not work...    I would like my money back..    I will buy a new phone this time...	0
The volume is very low. Can't hear ringing. Calls drop. 	0

The whole operating system was wiped when we got it so it was worthless. We couldn't even get our service provider to turn it on. Useless.	0

"The wireless cell phone did not come with everything that was described in the description. The cell phone was in bad condition. In the description it said that the cell phone would come with home charger, battery, car charger, and hands free head set. These things did not come in the package. The cell phone didn&apos;t even work when I recieved it. I had to replace the battery to even see if it would come on. The outside of the cell phone was scratched up and dinged badly."	0
The worst and useless	0
The worst ever experience! i cant use the iphone because the cellphone company said it Was stolen... And i return it to the seller and he didnt back the money... Thanks God ebay did it... No recommended!!!	0

THE WORST SELLER TO BUY A PHONE FROM.  I BOUGHT THE LG G4. IT WAS THE 32 GB. JACK SENT ME A BROKEN PHONE AND NOT THE ORIGINAL CHARGER OR BOX AND THE BUBBLE WRAP WAS NASTY AND SMELLY..BEWARE DON'T BUY FROM THIS SELLER.JACK DIDN'T GIVE ME MY FULL REFUND AND TOOK OUT $17.80 IN ITEM DEDUCTIONS AND I DON'T KNOW WHY.  I SENT HIM EVERYTHING HE SENT ME BACK IN PERECT SHAPE. PLEASE DON'T BUY FROM JACK.. BUYER BEWARE..I WARNED THEE.	0
"The XPERIA Play was a HUGE letdown.     Pros:   - Great Battery Life - outlasts any other on the market.  - PSP controller, fun for some games.  - Home dock included (new).  - 8gb microSD card.    Cons:  - Incredibly slow. A whopping 1GHz, single core processor. Struggles to keep up with fast texting. (Lamens: 30-40% speed of newer phones.)  - Sony Ericsson. They love making their own products, and messed up the 3.5mm headphone jack. You can&apos;t use any headphones that have a built in microphone (Apple/Beats by Dre/etc)  - The trackpad design of the PSP part is absolutely terrible. It&apos;s impossible to work with, and you might as well just use the touchscreen for any game that uses it.  - 1GB Internal Storage. I didn&apos;t notice this when I bought it, but 1gig is absolutely terrible, and they have tons of bloatware loaded on it."	0
"The ZTE Warp Elite is a great phone, I been wanting a large screen phone without paying a lot of money and with this phone I got exactly what I wanted and needed.  It has plenty of storage space, I have downloaded several games  and apps and still have memory.  It is also  holds comfortable in my hands, it does not feel bulky at all.  It takes great pictures that are very clear and the sound quality is great.  Very happy with this phone."	1

"There are great reviews on this phone and I like it a lot but PLEASE NOTE:    IF YOU BUY THE AT&amp;T ONE, make sure it&apos;s not a Go Phone (prepaid). I didn&apos;t realize until I read on yahoo answers that AT&amp;T intentionally disabled WiFi (or WLAN) on their version of the phone to make prepaid customers pay more for using mobile internet. The tricksters. If anyone has had this problem and figured out how to unlock it, please send a message to my eBay account."	0
"There are NO DRIVERS for any 64 bit version of Windows. This means this phone cannot connect with most computers using Windows 7. It is a great phone, I have had one for a few years and have always synced at work where XP is still used. I had hope to use this with my laptop with Win7.     I was frustrated with the installation process which kept failing and I didn&apos;t know why. I finally found information in Internet forums.    Descriptions of this phone on eBay should indicate that drivers for Win7 ARE NOT AVAILABLE"	0

I am very pleased with it. The phone is best when the software is debranded which means the software is that of the manufacturer without the add ons of a cellular service provider. Sony&apos;s download service for media, PlayNow needs to be available worldwide much like iTunes for apple so that users can add applications and music. This is a separate issue from the phone but is one that affects the phone since there are no other safe sources other than the PlayNow site from which to get applications, movies, and music for the SATIO. The RoadSync application only works with Gmail because it only works with exchange servers which a free gmail account supports unless you get a paid yahoo and hotmail account. If you set up your email account and you have hotmail then you should do the following for your OUTGOING MAIL SERVER:  Password - it should be same as for incoming mail  Outgoing mail server smtp.live.com  Access point as you wish - mine is always ask  Security ports should be StartTLS  THIS IS THE NEW SETTING THAT HAS RECENTLY CHANGED. BEFORE SSL/TLS WAS FINE BUT NOW THE MICROSOFT SERVER IS REJECTING SSL/TLS EMAIL   Port - make sure it is 25 or 587(submission port)  Some users have reported that it only works if you use Port 587 for outbound. This depends on whether or not not ISP is port blocking or not. I suggest you try 25 and if you still cannot send emails via hotmail, then change to 587."	1

"there is a difference when you buy a phone for parts that just does't turn on,and one that has water damage,rusted connectors,and missing parts,i know what i was buying,a phone for parts,but there is a lot of junk selling this days on ebay...just because it is an iphone?"	0
THERE IS A NATIONWIDE RECALL ON THIS PHONE BECAUSE IT CATCHES ON FIRE. 	0
"There is a reason why this phone was a &quot;freebie.&quot; No one in their right mind should pay money for it. This phone has been a pain from day one, and now 11 months into the contract it is nearly useless. It manages to unlock itself and makes calls all on its own if stored in a backpack or pocket. If you are actively talking on the phone, be careful... the touchscreen is super sensitive and your cheek can cause all kinds of interesting things to happen. There is NO calibration for the touchscreen. Yeah, that makes for some challenges when texting. Basically, as with most free phones, you get what you pay for. Buyer beware of this product."	0
There is allot to be said about buying new stuff&gt;  this was a used phone and permed as such!   The Battery was not strong!	0
There is no profile and no way to assign a network carrier. Its misleading.	0
There is no visible physical flaw on the phone. The shipment was on time and generally I think it a fair price for such a condition. 	1
There is water in the front camera so it looks pinkish when you try to use it. It has a sim lock on it as well. It is slightly damaged. 	0
there scratches alot on botoom	0
There was a indication of it dropped indentations on 2 edges nothing major immaculate screen and body great bargain especially after jailbreaked to marshmallow software 	1
There was a problem with my phone after purchase and phonestoreusa went over and above the call of duty to help me. I would highly recommend them for your phone needs! It is rare to find this kind of great customer service especially on the internet.	1
"there was hardly a scratch on it and the system works perfectly! my camera will make whirring noises when i try to open it, but it will still open and the quality is never affected! good product, good price"	1
there was quick delivery but im very disipointed with the cell phone as it was sold to me with water damage and that is the spot on the cell ..would have been nice to know that before purchase	0
there were chip marks on the phone as it had been dropped in two different places and there was a small chip mark near the sum card port so when I took it to AT&T to get it activivated they put the sim card in and it would go all the way back to the factory reset screen as it was your first time turning the phone on and it did that several times.	0
"There were several defects in functionalities: front camera would only work after a good shake, the finger print sensor didn't work, the front button had to be pressed really hard to work. So, we decided to return the item. Delivery took a bit longer than usually..."	0
"there&apos;s nothing i really like about it.  I just needed a phone that sucked less than the one I was using (which is a samsung sway- DO NOT BUY ONE. TRUST ME.)   the battery life on this is terrible. by noon the thing is dead. Plus the swivel thing is a P.O.S, it&apos;s always in the way.. it&apos;s far too bulky.. it&apos;s  like carrying around a cordless phone from 1989, especially with that ridiculous aentenna, which doesn&apos;t do squat.  I&apos;m definetely sending it back if I&apos;m not snowed in tomorrow. SUCKS. Now im going to have to return it and i&apos;ll still be out twenty bucks from the shipping to and from."	0
Theres white spot in the screen. It looks like screen has been changed.	0
"These are by no means brand new phones! Accessories are generic and box is also tampered with imei sticker is slapped over original imei! Sim tray color doesn't completely match the body color, it is either refurbished or used as demo! Haven't used it because it's a gift. Will not be buying anything from them in feature! "	0
"These are great phones and this is the second LG G3 that I have, the phone is easy to use and its fast. Only issue is the battery life is short, too many apps that run and LG wont let you kill them out, I have downloaded several apps to stop the from running, but as soon as you stop them they restart, Power Drain.  Unlocked is the only way to go, Use it with Straight Talk and it works Great !!!!!"	1
These are great phones.  I have actually purchased 3 of these new phones to have for backups when our other Sanyos quit working.  They are so good that my husband dropped his current phone in a cooler of ice water and didn&apos;t find it until hours later.  This was a few months ago.  The phone still works great.  In an area where reception is sometimes difficult the external antenna means you never lose a call.  Love these phones - even better for us than my LG Rumor Touch.	1
These are pieces of junk. When received the screen was hanging off one. The battery life stinks and there is no memory because it is used up by apps. If you want too waste your time and money buy these by all means buy 2 or 3.	0
"These are tough, long-lasting phones.  We just used our first one to death, and my husband is one of those HARD on phones kind of guys (drops them alot, in and out of water).  Glad we found these phones!"	1
"These guys are pawning off lower grade items to unsuspecting folks. They sent me a low grade item. I called in and they responded swiftly and sent me another... unfortunately it was the exact same low grade item. This happened again.... Finally, after a third time I began again calmly explaining the situation but they were extremely rude to the point where I had to hang up. I got a refund after 4 weeks of this and just purchased it elsewhere... waste. of. time...  thanks bigdeals.  top notch!"	0
"These guys sold me a Google locked phone!!! For those of you who are not aware what a Google phone is, basicly it's a safety feature put in place by google to help prevent theft. When you sell your android phone you have to log in to your Google account and log out of your account. Either these guys sold me a stolen phone or they didn't do there due diligence and check to make sure the phone was google unlocked. Either way I am sitting here with a phone I can not use. I have asked for refund twice now without getting a reply. Very unprofessional on there behalf as a seller. "	0
These items are sold for parts the parts need to be usable the screen was broken phone is locked and there is no certainty that the other parts would work	0
THESE PEOPLE ARE THE BIGGEST SCAMMERS OUT HERE ON EBAY..THEY SAID IN THE ADD THE PHONE WORKS GREAT..T HEN SEND YOU A BROKEN PHONE..THEN WHEN TRY TO CONTACT THEM THEY NEVER ANSWER YOU BACK AND KEEP YOUR MONEY..THIS IS HOW THEY SCAM PEOPLE OUT OF THIER MONEY..THEY ARE VERY DISHONEST PEOPLE AND SHOULD BE BANDED FROM EBAY TO SELL THERE..JUST REMEMBER PEOPLE THEY DON&apos;T STAND BY WHAT THEY SELL..THEY ARE THE BIGGEST SCAMMERS I HAVE EVER SEEN!!! SHAME ON YOU!!!	0
These phones are fake they r not real s7's	0
"These phones are nice but have to give a low rating because they have issues that you can goolgle. Most issues are buzzing speakers , bad pixels in screens also people have noticed colored lines or blue colored blemishes in the screens , turbo charging stops working along with other issues. I have owned a few of these and love them and will never buy a used one or one without warranty, If you buy a used one look into getting a warranty from squaretrade online. "	0
these phones are Verizon pre paid phones! and they are not mint the screens are scuffed!	0
"These phones have a tab under the battery that turns pink or red if there is moisture damage. That is why I was replacing mine. This used phone had the same problem. I replaced the battery, I had to get a new sim card. The phone will not function. No signal, Battery drains. So I am starting all over with a new phone."	0
"These phones were made to be sold through Target stores for around $100+, I bought mine on E-bay new for $50, but now I know why they are selling online so cheap. They are crap, basically. They are ok to make calls with, but the camera sucks,, especially the fron facing camera. The pictures are always very dark and sometimes you can hardly see an image on the screen at all. Therear camera is a little better. The volume in videos sucks. You basically have to scream for it to record a voice properly so that you can hear it on play back. Sometimes it doesn't pick up any voice at all, even though you are speaking in a regular tone. Forget when the battery gets below 20%. The Phone acts up. And if you plug it in to charge when it is that low and you go to use the phone, for example, to type something, the keyboard goes crazy and it starts typing random letters. It comes with a so-called phone protector, which is basically a thin flimbsy cover that stays in place by wraping into the top sides of the phone, but it will loosen up on the sides a little, constantt charges through the top, which is a little odd, something that I haven't seen since ZTE started to make phones for AT&T a few years back. The charger cord seems loose when you plug it into the phone, removes a little too easily. "	0
These were a perfect fit for my cell phone. Product is great and price is right. This seller ship fast and I will recommend this seller to other buyer.	1
They advertise the Honor 7X is compatible with AT & T and T-Mobile and is fully LTE capable.  I have T-Mobile and I can only get 3G....I have been to Sprint...Verizon and AT & T as well..put SIM cards from each and NO LTE...The phone only has a setting for 4G.........It is a shame as it is a cool phone with a great camera......it is going back today 	0
They are lyin i was skeptical because box was open but they said it was clean i got this phone and cant even use it. Its already been used and i want my money back asap. Do not buy from them. It clearly is a scam	0

They are very good phones.	1
"They charge my money, and many days lather say that phone was sold out, and even no body inform me, i was able to lose lot of time..... Filling look like they use my money????"	0
"they charge way to much for air time,and unless you lock the features you&apos;ll be calling half way across the country and not even know it.If you feel the need to purchase one,atleast make sure you buy a flip phone and thats not just this co. it&apos;s all of them.It&apos;s worth the extra few dollars for a flip."	0
They claim that it's guerunteed delivery it's not I now have to go file a police report just to get my money back because my package never came I tried working it out with the seller all they did was lag more and more claim to be waiting on a response from USPS so I asked eBay to step in they did but they closed the case because the seller sent tracking info now Im going to call the police and file a report for this phone but they can't even provide me the IMEI number or serial number for the phone that they are refusing to refund me like what the hell how do I know they even sent the device if they can't tell me the identification number of the device	0
They did not release the phone from the account making it unusable. I asked for assistance and while responsive at first there was no follow up. I was disappointed bc this was a very nice phone. 	0

They listed this phone as a 16 gb phone went to get apps download for my daughter for Christmas in fact only 8gb wont hold the apps! Contacted the seller he told me sorry person I bought it from ripped me off so cant do anything for you! So because he got ripped off he listed the item wrong in fact to recollect his money and screw someone else!!! Very shady seller BUYERS BEWARE!!!!! Doesnt except returns either!! 	0

They said the phone was fully functional but is the opposite noting works because icloud is locked  	0
They say they ship it from new york but they ship it from China. I think now you all know enough about the phone. Because it was sealed but not with original sealing but a fake one. Since phone is unlocked how can you seal box again with samsung sticker on it. But yeah you all can pick and see for yourself.	0
They send a different box. It was open box. Not seal on the box.	0

They sent the wrong iPhone and didn't try to reimburse me.	0
"They shipped the first phone out to me immediately.  Had a couple of minor problems with the phone and requested a return.  Got back with me immediately with a return number, no questions asked, only apologies for the inconvenience.  Later purchased this Samsung, received it immediately, and have been happy with the phone.    Would recommend to everyone.  Great job."	1
They should say it is not an unlocked phone. since it was a Verizon we assumed it was unlocked.	0
"They sold me a junk phone. The phone only lasted a couple of days, then froze up and would not shut off. WE HAD TO DESTROY THE PHONE. I Will never again buy a Recondition phone."	0

They took a long time to get the phone to me me and the battery is horrible. I have to walk around with a charger all day 	0
They turn on and work for a few minutes but as soon as you dial a phone number they shut down by themselves. I want my money back but I am in Argentina now....bad deal...	0
They were so accommodating to us and the phone was perfect and they shipped FAST. I would hope that someone see&apos;s that they are wonderful business people and that they do what they say and more. A ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++	1
"They will send you a fake tracking number delivered on your same state, but different city. They were probably hoping their scam will slide through and buyers won't complain since after 35 days of not saying/reporting anything, that will remove your eBay buyer protection! Nice scheme!  If you do complain, message them a million times and don't hear anything from them. Try calling them and ask for a refund, they will tell you that they will ship the item to you and you will get the ""right tracking number"". Wait for a couple of days and 'Voila!' you will get a totally different phone that is not as described from their item description. Bought a new phone for the price of $219.99. Expect to get a cheaper version of it in a crappy packaging, opened and destroyed box. Besides that you'll see that the plastic protector of the phone itself looks like it has been taped by a 2-year old! Try and report the transaction to eBay they will favor this fakers because they gave the ""right tracking number""!  Probably other people had a better experience than me with this company, but you will see from others who also gave them a negative feedback that they had the same experience!  WORST BUYING EXPERIENCE HERE ON eBay WITH VERY UNPROFESSIONAL SELLER: pricebreak-deals! THEY WILL REALLY BREAK YOUR "	0

"This by far has been a scam. I ordered the 128 GB 6S Plus from this seller and I got a 64 GB version. Also the Touch ID feature wasnt working at all. I asked to return it and get my refund for false advertising and when I returned it, I did not get my refund. Still days that I havent heard back from this seller. I will never again buy from this seller. Highly dissapointed!"	0

"This definitely has to be the best iPhone that Apple produced- better than the first, the 3G, and the iPhone 4. This is coming from someone who owned the iPhone 4 and decided to go back to the 3GS due to mounting problems. Unlike the iPhone 4, you don&apos;t have to worry about reception issues with the 3GS because the antenna is placed at the top where it should be. This phone is also a lot faster than the 2G and 3G (loads apps faster, less lag, overall a more fluid experience). The only things the iPhone 4 has on this phone is that it has a better display and a faster processor. The faster processor doesn&apos;t make a huge difference considering your still limited by AT&amp;T&apos;s lame excuse for a network. Many will say &quot;oh this doesn&apos;t have facetime unlike the iPhone 4&quot;. Let me tell you the truth about FaceTime- you are never going to use it. It&apos;s just like a fingerprint reader on a laptop- it&apos;s one of those things where you say &quot;oh, this will be cool to have&quot; but you never use it. The 3GS also has that fantastic clamshell design that fits perfectly in your hand unlike the iPhone 4. The 3GS is just the best of everything: best design, no antenna issues, etc. This phone is simply the easiest phone to use: there is really no learning curve making this an extremely intuitive device. Besides, who would want to pay over $500 for the iPhone 4 with no contract when they can get this phone for much less? All you&apos;re paying for are frivolous features that you probably won&apos;t use. Aside from a few features, they are basically the same phone. Software is updated amongst all iPhones so you can still be up to date. Bottom line: the 3GS is the no-nonsense iPhone that does everything you need it to do and does it well. You won&apos;t regret this: the iPhone 3GS is hands down the best iPhone."	1
this device has been recalled through t mobile and should be removed and returned to T-Mobile for full refund. T-mobile stores will be able to assist with the return process otherwise this phone should not be sold for safety concerns.	0
This device is Harith the flaws from the factory  He was sent to the company a month ago But did not receive my money	0
"This device was sold as an unlocked device.  According to t-mobile, it is not compatible with their system.  Received phone with everything in Spanish. Required multiple phone calls and trips to T-mobile to get to work.  Every time I use it, it will lock out before I can key in the next function (this may be a programming feature, but with out adequate information, cannot change it)  Nobody could give information on how to program favorites.  As I do not hear well, I could not get volume to a level I could use.  Does not compare to my 3 year old Nokia.  Was sold as a 4G LTE device.  According to to T-mobile (due to the incompatibility)  it only operates at a 2G level.  Device was returned, as it does not solve my problem."	0
"This does everything I need it to do, but I have a few complaints. The battery life is terrible! I stream music to Bluetooth speakers at work and the battery only lasts about 5 hours before I have to plug it in. It also charges very slow. If I forget to plug it in until it's almost dead, I have to plug it in when I get in the car or it is dead before I get home. I also am having trouble changing the wallpaper. I choose a pic and it says that my wallpaper has been changed, but when I go to the home screen, it's still on the generic LG wallpaper. I am also having trouble with it chiming when I get a text message. Sometimes it chimes and sometimes it doesn't. It isn't consistant. Sometimes my boss will text me and it will let me know. Other times I have to check it every little bit to see if I have messages. The phone was cheap, but it still isn't performing basic operations. I will probably take the loss and buy something else."	0
"This ended up being an even better buy than I thought. It was in better condition than described, and I am absolutely more than satisfied with this purchase!"	1
This flagship HTC phone boasts all of the specs of the U12+ with an even larger storage space and the addition of a seperate chip meant to hold blockchain assets seperate from the android operating system in order to create additional security.The HTC Exodus one will help expand the adoption and use of cryptocurrency as well as revolutionize tech security and indiviudal freedoms.	1

This get hot and it will freeze up on you. It want let you text because it keep on freeze. I will never purchase this type of phone. I had to go to a cellular phone to purchase myself another phone.	0
This guy buys and resells phone. Tmobile cancelled my plan because they looked into the phone I bought from this guy and it's not paid off and they won't even let us finish the payments. Ebay support isn't any help either because the guy forwarded me to PayPal and they told me I need to talk to Ebay. Complete scam.	0
This guy is a good dude. The gift got here the day before my soon to be husbands birthday and I let him open it early! (Our first birthdays as an engaged couple... 4 days between our birthdays ) and he loved it! Thank you thank you thank you!	1
this guy is a thief . never buy or sell anything to him . i bought a phone from him and yes he did send it . but it didnt go through from x ray machine cos of its battery and got sent back to him . than he fully cut the contact with me . i wrote him so many times to ask my money back but he never replied . i hope god doesnt let you to spend that money .	0

"This guy is very very very slow reponding to ur inquiries or won't respond at all , very irresponsible.  I won't buy from him again and also you shouldn't if you don't want to go thru the headache I have been thru. First I ordered the product, no problem here, they shipped me the wrong product, waste of time, then you have to return the item back, then you have to wait many days for then to refund ur money, you have to be consistently asking for a refund or they won't do it. Whole process took me around 1 month. Please don't don't go thru the same hassle"	0

This guy/girl keep on listening this item with different price & different story 	0
"This has all essential basic features for a cell phone. The sound is clear.  Various ear pieces hook into it to allow hands free conversation.  It is compact and folds easily for putting into pockets.  It is durable.  For Verizon users, it is easy to activate by inputting the code number under the battery and following the instructions on the verizon wireless web sit.  Due to the current low cost of the recycled SCH A650 cell phones and the ease of activating replacement phones, it makes good sense to keep a spare around.  Thus, it is easy to replace a lost phone and to retrieve phone book data from the verizon wireless backup assistant system."	1
"This has been a great phone. I have used a Razr for years. This was slightly different, but close enough that set up and use was a snap. I like the way it feels in the hand. Little thicker but not as wide, and is seems easier to hold and use. Fits the nylon belt holsters I had for the Razr fine."	1
"This has been my worst purchase on Ebay. Both phones flip door is creaky, sticks, and one has a broken piece on it.  Could not get either phone to work.  Very disappointed."	0
"This has been the best smartphone I've ever owned! The screen is big and gorgeous, with its high resolution and clarity.  The battery life is great (with a few setting tweaks), the Bluetooth connection with my Ford Sync system and Vivosmart fitness band works flawlessly, as well as my WiFi connection to my home router and WiFi hotspots.   I've had this phone for a few months now, and I'm very pleased with my upgrade.   No SD Card? No Removeable Battery? Not waterproof? Sound familiar? It should since the iPhone has never had any of these features. The Galaxy is now identical to the iPhone in these aspects but the galaxy's performance, display and camera are a step ahead of Apple. Throw in a fast charging battery and it's a ""no brainier"".   Keep in mind that I have an iPhone 6 as my personal phone and now have a Galaxy S6 as my work phone. Thumbs up to the iPhone, it's a great phone but I'd take the Galaxy over it any day of the week. This is a great phone, and I highly recommend it."	1
"This has got to be the fastest smoothest most awesome phone I have ever used.  I like the iphone, but LOVE this!  There are just so many things that this does that most other phones do NOT do.  Unbelievable.  Well done Google on getting this phone from HTC with a 1gig processor that is smokin fast even though it is not rooted!!!  I have had the G1 and MyTouch 3g and rooted both of em to get decent speeds.  Not even going to root this phone, cause it does not need it for the speed.  I know there are other reasons to root, but I want to enjoy this for a while before doing it.  Can not say enough about this phone and the Car Dock I purchased as well.  Great feature and love the speaker that comes in the Car Dock for hands free and very good listening quality!  All in all, I would say 5 stars!!!!"	1
"This has to be the worst phone that Motorola manufactures. The worst &apos;feature&apos; it has is the side buttons on the flip door. When in the closed position, they enable the camera or MP3 player. If you move wrong, one or the other comes on, draining your battery. The outside up/down volume toggle quit working two weeks after the PTT button quit working....and the software is just as bad. It takes 12 keypad inputs to get to your voicemail selection???"	0
"This huawei P10 lite is a great ""smarth"" phone. The eight cores of the processor and the 4GB of RAM are enough to give me a good multitasking experience. I did not see any stutters or lagging when I used the smartphone for browsing, watching videos, listening to music, scrolling on Facebook and other similar activities. This is a good smartphone, but it is not extraordinary when it comes to games.This smartphone can run all the latest games but not at highest graphics quality settings.  I got impressed for its battery, in average use that did not involve games, it managed to last us for a day and another couple of hours without needing to charge. On a day in which I played games roughly for an hour or so, and in a day when we also spent probably more than 2 hours on Facebook, the smartphone asked to be charged in the evening. This is both a good phone and a good smartphone. It gave me an excellent experience regarding to: phone calls sound quality and the radio signal reception. I also appreciate the fluent experience in multitasking. The only downside of this smartphone is gaming."	1
"This in my opinion is one of the best phones from BlackBerry. I highly reccomend it. It IS a smartphone, because you can install Java apps."	1
"This iphone 4, having 32 Gig memory, was bought for a friend not familiar with wireless cell phone. I chose this particular old model due to its ease of operation. This phone arrived in like new condition. Due to the fact that Apple no longer provides upgrades for this model it lacks speed for use on anything but basic internet. For the person I had bought this phone for this slowness on the web is of no issue. What matters is ease of operation, a loud and legible sound both on speaker phone, and held to ear, and in this particular phone a large enough memory to save many photos. There are other iPhone 4s for sale on eBay for much cheaper than the $45. I spent, yet they lack large memory. "	1

I'm trying to get my money refunded now from the Seller. I my need to get eBay or my Credit Card company involved! What a hassle. Beware of DiTech.	0
"this iphone can not be used on verizon network in US, CDMA locked, seller just a cheater.    before I bought it, I saw it can be used on CDMA network, because my friend is verizon customer, so I bought it and gave him as a gift.However, it is something wrong and can not be used on CDMA network, only can be used on GSM network. how sadly"	0

I had this phone for a month when the screen stopped working (no cracks or damage). When requested return/exchange, they rejected the request and didn't provide sufficient explanation why they wouldn't honor their policy.   I am having to have the screen replaced at my own expense, so my advice is to look elsewhere."	0

"This is a fully loaded phone at a terrific price!  You cannot find a better priced device with the same features.  It is a slider phone with a 2.2&quot; screen that has a feature packed menu with multimedia options for pics/videos/messaging.  The only minor drawback is that it is a little bulky due to its square shape, but that is overshadowed by all the features that the phone includes!"	1
"This is a gift to my wife, she had a few phones that were junk from the start. From a friend of mine he told me it was time to get her one that would keep her happy with how easy it is to use.     Now if they can come up with a forgotten message, to the owner that she left it lay some place while on for to long, it would sound a tone to reminder her to pick phone up and do not forget where she put it, that would be great."	1
"This is a good little phone. Xlnt build quality, fantastic battery life and I was soooooooooooo wrong about Windows 8 ! its much easier to use than android and you get none of the drama of Google either.   Just a nice little cheap well built phone. I like it alot."	1
"This is a good phone for a kid or someone who doesn&apos;t stay on their phone all day. I like the size of the phone and durability but that&apos;s all. the camera is terrible, has no flash, loads apps slow (especially facebook, if you spend alot of time on facebook don&apos;t get this phone.) the keyboard is pretty small for a smart phone, and there isn&apos;t very much memory on this phone."	0

"This is a great basic phone.  It doesn&apos;t have all the bells and whistles, but it&apos;s perfect for an older person or a child.  I bought it for when my family members from overseas come to visit, so that they would have a phone to use while they are here.  Unfortunately I made the mistake of signing up with &quot;NET 10&quot; Horrible customer service and bad policies.  You get a better and cheaper service with pre-paid Tmobile!"	1

This is a great deal on a great great phone thanks!!!!	1

"This is a great little phone and it's my long-time favorite. I've replaced this model 3 times, this being the third time. It fits perfectly in my pocket and though I use a Motorola Droid Maxx (XT1080), I keep the Razr M (XT907) as a backup and to play on."	1
This is a great little phone. Hubby loves his flip phones and he really likes this one. Easy to use and fits into his pocket. It's very close to his old one so it was easy for him to figure out. And the price was fantastic and shipping was fast.Great service all the way around !!	1
"This is a great model phone which we already owned. It could happen to any vendor so we don't want to blame this one, but the phone we received was totally defective. We're writing this review only out of concern that a ""whole batch"" or carton of them might have been defective. Anyone who buys one from Ebay needs to check it thoroughly. we have since bought another from a different source and it's as marvelous as the one we already owned."	0
"This is a great phone , in great condition. It works great no problems or complaints."	1
This is a great phone and I will be purchasing another....  I would also recommend this product to Friends &amp; Family	1
"This is a great phone at a great price. Wonderful experience with the seller, I will definitely be doing business with them again!"	1
This is a great phone for a childs safety phone or 1st time phone purchase.  I purchased it for my neice and she loves it.  We attached it to her bookbag  for school and incase of emergency.  It makes her feel much more safe and in touch with me when she is away.  Great phone.	1
"This is a great phone for many uses.  I love the large screen and the quick response.  It takes wonderful pictures and is easy for playing games. I have had several Samsung Galaxy phones, and each is better than the last.  This one is a winner.  I bought it used, and although the ad said it is 32 GB, it is actually only 16.  That will be plenty for me though, so I&apos;m not complaining."	1
This is a great phone for the money and the seller was quick with the shipping and processing. A++++++.	1
This is a great phone for the price.  I purchased this phone for my 16 year old son.  The full exposure to the keyboard is great for texting.  We purchased a pair of ear-buds so he could download his favorite music.  I like the design and seems to be pretty durable.	1
This is a great phone for those used to the full keyboard.  I downgraded from blackberry to this phone with ease.  Much nicer then most basic cell phones out there and price is a decent value.	1
"This is a great phone if you like Windows Mobile, and usually for a great price....Open Microsoft Office files straight from the phone....."	1
"This is a great phone in terms of specs camera, ram the like. BUT I was displeased that seller sold me this phone other the impression that its a NEW PHONE yet it is a refurbished phone that I am not happy about at all"	0
This is a great phone perfect for someone who doesn&apos;t know how to work a smart phone like my mom this phone was perfect for her!	1
"This is a great phone with all the features for someone looking for a phone with phone buttons (0 to 9), no touch pad, and Windows Mobile on a small form factor, not a PDA size, exactly what my wife and I want.  It is great to be able to get these discontinued items that work well and at a reasonalble price without a contract impact."	1
"This is a great phone!  I bought it to replace my current one and find that&apos;s it&apos;s so much better than what I had.  My only complaint is the battery life. You will definitely need a charger nearby, whether in the house or car."	1
This is a great phone! Super fast shipping (had it at the post office within 4 hours of me purchasing it!) and came just as described! Thank you so much!	1
"This is a great phone!!!!    I bought this phone for a Christmas present for my son.  WHen he received it, he was immediately impressed with the number of features available on this inexpensive phone. It has a camera, video camera, and speakerphone. The size is perfect for carrying in a pocket and the battery has a pretty good lifespan.  Overall, I&apos;d recommend the phone if you&apos;re on a budget."	1
"This is a great phone, hard to find anymore.  Only flaw I have found is there is no flashlight.  You have to go online and download the flashlight app. "	1
"This is a great phone, I really liked it! it has wifi and the keyboard is great, touchscreen is good too, can&apos;t complain of this phone! it may not be a recent model but you sure will enjoy it!"	1
"This is a great phone, i would reccomend it to anybody who likes texting.    Pros: Big bright screen, easy to use, TONS of apps, full keyboard, battery life.    Cons: When the keyboard is opened, the bottom (when upright) or right side of the the phone gets in the way a little and takes some time to get used to.    Overall a great phone"	1
"This is a great phone,and easy to use.They don&apos;t sell this phone anymore.It gets great reception and easy to use. If you want just a phone and text.This phone is for you. I have no use for a smart phone.I&apos;ll stick with this one. And besides, it keeps the phone bill cheaper.Don&apos;t have to have the internet to activate this phone. Who&apos;s smarter you or the phone? lol Think about it."	1
"this is a great phone.  i have no complaints.  it works and looks great, also came with case which was great!"	1
"This is a great phone. battery lasts all day and then some. It's sturdy and very rugged, will not slip through your fingers like the others yet it's light weight and comfortable in the hand. It does everything the Galaxy 8 will do"	1
"This is a great phone. I had one before but switched service providers and thought I would try out a Blackberry. Love the Moto Q way more and decided to go back to it. Love the windows based system. You can open a word document and even edit or compose a new one. Fairly easy to use and it has a great format, quality sound, external memory card slot so you don&apos;t need to remove the battery. All around a great phone with so much functionality. I would recommend this phone to anyone whether you need a great business phone or just to the average user."	1
"This is a great phone. I think the textured keypad is an upgrade over the razor. It has been easy to customize (hot key assignment and personal wallpaper). It is a nice and slim, not bulky. Battery life has been exceptional.    I had to buy a new phone because I dropped my previous phone in the yard. i found it as my mower chopped it to a million pieces. It was a zero cost phone with my ATT plan. It was only a few months old, so when I chopped it I had to buy a new one. The bad experience with the zero cost phone made me more willing to drop a little extra coin on the new one. So far, I am happy I did.    I will offer one tip to anyone who buys this phone. Install a media card and change the phone book from the sim card to the media card. If you do not do this, you can only enter one phone number per entry. Switching to the memory card allows you to add all of a person&apos;s contact info."	1
"This is a great phone. I'm an iPhone fanboi but didn't want to pay $1300 for the new 8 next year so forced myself to buy a cool phone beforehand!   The Yotaphone fits the bil When I show it people say ""WTF!"".   Make sure you buy the UK/EU/Russian YD201 version not the Chinese YD206 grey model, unless your savvy with rooting and sideloading to hack it. Otherwise you'll be stuff with Kitkat4.4 and Chinese apps. You won't be able to log in to Google or use Google Play, it'll let you download it though.  My auction said it was a YD206 but I got a YD201! I was so happy.   Yota company are bickering, about who owns what, after raising cash by selling chunks of the company to various blood suckers. I don't a Yotaphone 3 will be created. Grab one now. "	1
This is a great phone. It is great for working people that are hard on their phones.	1
"This is a great phone. Long battery life, Lolipop 5.1.1 and runs all apps. It beats the Galaxy S4 it replaced. Why spend $600-$700 for a name phone when you can but this?"	1
"This is a great phone. On top of being a RAZR, which means dependability, ruggedness, and quality - I like this particular operating system version. I&apos;m not sure if it is just the Motorola V3S version or it is a Metro PCS hybrid version. But it is more intuitive than some of the previous RAZR versions. Great overall package for Metro PCS users that only want the basic talk and send pictures features, in an attractive clamshell design. An added perk is that accessories for these phones are dirt-cheap. I have picked up a couple used RAZRs and they still are working - they seem to last forever."	1
This is a great phone. Very fast and easy to use. I switched from a Windows phone to an Android but I just didn&apos;t like the Android phone. I switched back to this phone which is a big improvement from my old 521. Love the phone.	1
"This is a great price for a good phone, its a gift for my grandson and he loves it."	1
This is a great product at an amazing price. It arrived very quickly and in excellent condition. 	1

"This is a great seller, the product delivered was better than I expected.  Look forward to buying from you again  soon."	1
This is a great starter phone for a young person. Inexpensive and fully functional.	1
This is a great way to get an unlocked LG G4 for less cost than buying new and it still functions great! 	1
"This is a high quality phone for less. Its functioning as intended. No issue. However, the lack of a camera and unrestricted wifi capability even though its indicated as having it was a turn off.Other that,I am satisfied."	1
this is a horrid phone.  we have to go get another one it does not work... i would really like to get my money back.  i will send the phone back too.  3/4 of the time it doesn&apos;t work... no service etc..	0
"This is a liar,I have sent a lot of mail to the seller, but did not receive a reply.  I received an item that wasn t as described Seller Description: 128GB, Factory Unlocked, NO ICLOUD LOCK. But I received an item is only 16GBThrough the software,Factory lockedSIM card cannot be activated,ICLOUD LOCKThe most angry is that he never replies to my email.. This is my first negative feedback."	0
"This is a mockery, the devices are in very bad condition, I feel cheated !!!!"	0
"This is a nice phone and worked like a charm--for about the first 3 weeks.  Then the touch began working only intermittently.  This progressively got worse and in addition the phone began acting peculiarly.  Apps began loading without my selecting them.  The world clock appeared and reappeared at will.  At times, the touch was so unresponsive that I couldn't even unlock the phone.   I have had a Galaxy S4 previously and it worked well for several years.  This one appears to be a lemon,"	0
This is a nice phone to look at.But i have be unable to use because it is not a verizon wireless.Verizon has know ideal who it belongs to so im still resecarching this phone.	0
This is a nice scam.	0
"THis is a perfect phone for talking and simple texting. It is compact, has high quality sound, and good signal strength. It is excellent with any handsfree bluetooth device."	1
"This is a piece of crap, it won't read sim card. It says invalid sim card, I try resetting and cleaning the sim card slot, but nothing happen. It's very frustrating"	0
"This is a poor phone, definitely not 5 stars! You will lose signal during calls and be disconnected. You will lose signal while texting and not be able to receive or send texts. I am going to buy a new phone because I am sick of poor reception and people thinking I hanged up on them. (And no its not where I am using it, Never had this problem before)"	0
this is a present for the boyfriend who i know will be pleased with the phone.i didnt think id end up paying so much but with the phone in excellent condition a car charger to use and other accessories i m glad i had it.	1
"This is a quality smartphone, and easy to use."	1
This is a really excellent phone. it is one of the best blackberry. Very fast in any way. I have been using it for a very long time.	1
This is a really good phone man I got mine directly from them for 950 and it was good it's so powerfully and beautiful I could easily open the phone just by looking at it and I will buy another one for my family	1
"This is a really great phone. Crystal call quality, nice touch resistant screen, and smooth performance. Fantastic camera with flash and video mode. Also has a built in video editor that you can have a little fun with.  My only complaints about the Eve are in battery life and the Android OS itself. The battery only lasts about a day with regular use. Honestly maybe a day and a half but I always charge it to be safe.   The problem with the OS isn&apos;t in Android itself, Android&apos;s great. The problem is that for some reason LG nor any phone provider(in Canada or U.S. to date) has released the upgrade to 2.2. In fact it hasn&apos;t even gotten the update past 1.5 yet. This is a big issue as it drastically reduces the amount of apps you can use.   I would suggest putting Open Etna on it. Just google as it&apos;s to much to explain how to do it right now. Basically though Open Etna will give you the update right to 2.2. They say it improves battery life but I&apos;m not too sure about that. It does however give you the ability to use whatever app you want. Let&apos;s be honest on this topic too, apps are a huge part of the reason you&apos;d even want a droid phone, so this is a big deal!  To conclude I think that the LG Eve(GW620) is a great phone. Really cheap compared to other Droid phones and still runs great. The camera is exceptional quality(5mp) with flash and video abilities. Just has a couple(solvable) drawbacks. I would definitely suggest getting your hands on one!"	1
"this is a replacement for one that went bad, covered by SquareTrade, who handled it very quickly and efficiently. wife has same phone and loves it also"	1
"this is a scam, apple website sells them max 800"	0
This is a slim phone with lots of battery life.  No issues with the ports or touchscreen since purchase.	1
"This is a sturdy phone, and great for someone who does not want a smart phone.. I bought an Alcatel from sprint and it was terrible. The processor was so slow that it locked up all the time. This phone is a much better choice. "	1
"This is a T-Moblie phone and I got it for use with AT&amp;T. Seems like its fine with the AT&amp;T network. I like the phone. Very rubery like so it won&apos;t slip out of my hands. I drop a lot of phones. Very cool design and handy too. You can listen to music on it like it was a MP3 player and its a good phone as well. Just like any other phones out there, it does just about anything. I like it. Recomended for any one who just wants a good reliable phone. Motorola is the best, I feel, out there you can get. Great company."	1
This is a Tracfone phone that is no longer supported by Tracfone -- it is useless!	0
"this is a true rugged phone,large and in charge!!  I love it! Great call quality,great features and No data plan!!!!!"	1
"This is a used piece of junk listed as new. For starters,  battery was already inside phone half charged. New Samsung S5s have the battery sealed in plastic for you to install. Couldn't download apps. Charger didn't charge either. Probably a knockoff product."	0
"This is a VERRRYY difficult phone to work with , unless you are tech /cell phone  wizard. Learning- through trial and error  to make a call  took 20mins .  Also mine came (bought at ebay  beginning of  April 2016 and it sat,   sealed until, I could get  screen protection and a case  . Both are a pain to get sent quickly and are not good unless you buy a  Tempered  Glass screen protector -buy it on ebay or else it will be $40 !?!!!  Seller on ebay  was  $6 +     This phone is basically about ""dabbing"" 2 times to get out what you want in app and widget.   Disappointing  in   accessibility,  and befuddling in many ways .excellent in   Good battery duration. Haven't used the camera or video or Harmon Kardon sound system.      All in all ,not what I expected, BUT I'm going to learn what I can  , and eventually sell it "	0
"This is a very dishonner person, after recieved money from paypal and then refuse to ship the phone, please DO NOT deal with this person, will take this case to ebay to suspend this seller and I&apos;m expect refund"	0
"This Is a Very Fine Small Phone, I just took it on a trip to Hawaii, and it worked great. Easy to store names, numbers, or pictures. The Battery  holds a charge for several days, When needed, It Charges fast. Has great sound. One of the best , Easy to use for phone calls ,Text, Pictures,. Cheaper phone, But Very Dependable for Normal everyday use.I think It is Great for General Use.!!!!!"	1
This is a very good phone nice for watching videos. Easy to see excellent battery life and very intuitive. However the seller is unresponsive and doesn&apos;t respond to inquiries about the phone. This phone as of now cannot be activated because it is listed on another account	0
"this is a very good phone, with touch scream, and keyboard, really useful. i will recommend this one for every one."	1
"This is a very high quality mobile. Very easy to use, excellent performance &amp; design. There are a lot of apps to install on it. Nice games with good graphics.  The only missing thing is a flash for the camera wich is only 2megapixels, but rasonable photo quality."	1
"This is a very nice cell ,I Recommend it "	1
This is a very nice looking and working phone. Many great features with it and no dissapointments with it so far.	1
"This is a very nice phone overall.  It is a nice thin design, and a very tough phone that handles lots of abuse.  Unlike other phones I had in the past, I can actually hear this one ring.  The camera works better than your average cell phone camera.  The dial up networking was very easy to figure out.  The menu options are very organized in this phone as well, compared to other phones I had in the past.    The seller I dealt with was very good to work with as well, and the phone came very quickly.    This phone is an excellent choice for anyone.  I didnt care that it was pink, since it worked so well for me."	1
"This is a very nice phone. Battery life is good too. Been using this phone for a few months now. I really enjoy it. It has a sharp screen, fits in the pocket well. Using this LG G6 Verizon brand phone with Total Wireless. Excellent phone. "	1
"This is a very simple, easy to use flip phone. Good, large characters, simple menu structure, and good (and loud if you set it that way) volume. It's perfect for people who just want a phone, not a smartphone."	1
"This is a warning please be careful !!! This tablet is FAKE in my view the RAM is 1GB NOT 4GB and the ROM is 12GB NOT 64GB. I am very disappointed because these are the tow factors that made me buy this tablet. Unfortunately this tablet is from a US store, US stock and US seller NOT from china cheaters "	0
This is a wonderful product just as described! Thanks!	1
"THIS IS ABOUT THE SELLER - THE ITEM WAS EXACTLY AS I EXPECTED - HOWEVER - EVERYONE IS OVERLOOKING THE HUMAN PART OF WHY WE ARE ALL DOING ANY OF THIS.  OR, IS IT REALLY &quot;ALL&quot; ABOUT MONEY AND &quot;THINGS&quot; !  ON MY SIDE OF THE STREET I BELIEVE WE ARE HERE TO COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER, AND LOVE THY NEIGHBOR - IT IS HARD TO LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR WHEN THEY DON&apos;T COMMUNICATE WITH YOU - SINCE I AM NOT A MIND READER.  GOOD LUCK TO ALL OF YOU WHO DO NOT &quot;COMMUNICATE&quot; - LEARN TO COMMUNICATE BY USING SIMPLE, LOVING, KIND, WORDS, ONCE YOU CAN GET THE OTHER PERSON TO &quot;COMMUNICATE&quot; WITH YOU."	0
This is actually a new iphone rather than seller trying to pawn off a rebuilt as new.  Very happy with purchase!	1
This is an amazing phone if wanna have a simple phone.	1
THIS IS AN AUSOME PHONE.  ITS EASY TO TEXT WITH AND VERY EAST TO OPERATE.  I GIVE THIS PHONE A 5 OUT OF 5 RATING.  I LOVE THESE PHONES WE HAVE 3 OF THEM AND AFTER TRING OTHER PHONES WITH TEXTING ABILITES I ALWAYS GO BACK TO THIS ONE.	1
"This is an awesome phone.  It has everything you need without it being a smartphone, Iphone, etc.  It&apos;s smart in itself when navigating through contacts, music, video, everything, and is lightning fast.  The polyphonic ringtones are great... something I will miss on my new phone along with the sound quality of calls it is crystal-clear, and loud enough to hear with background noise going on.  The phone I have now does not I&apos;ve had to make a downgrade from this phone.  I&apos;ve had many, many of non-smartphones and this was the best one hands down.  The MP3 player sounds very good.  If you are deciding on basic phones, get this one!!!!"	1
This is an awesome value for the Samsung Galaxy S8. I'm so glad I purchased it and the camera is amazing.	1
"This is an excelent phone!  I utilize all the features for school and work. Thank you for contacting me aobut the delivery issue, and it deliverd very fast.  Thank you so much and have a great weekend."	1
"This is an excellent cellphone, it has a very good graphic quality, it&apos;s very easy to use, excellent camera, the touch sense is awesome, the sound is PERFECT, and the phone has a FM radio, many sites says there is no radio but is does have it.  The bad thing is that in all specifications says that the HTC one V; has 4GB of internal memory, where on the phone as total internal memory you only have 0.94GB; I was searching info about it and all comes to this comment that I found on the web &quot;I have contacted HTC and have been told that the 3.1GB is taken by the software, and that they do give information on the website:&quot;The available storage you can use will be lesser, since the phones software occupies some storage.&quot; but don&apos;t take me wrong, it&apos;s a 4.0.3 Android Software, so i recommend you to buy the 32GB sd-card like i did and you will feel delightful with this cellphone.      And there is nothing better than the free download apps ;^)    Bye !"	1
"This is an excellent phone even if you don&apos;t have touch to talk service, as the t2t service isn&apos;t required to use the phone with alltel.  Perfect if you work in a noisy place/household or have trouble hearing at times. Excellent speakerphone--and extremely well built. The 1 star review above would be better left in the sellers FEEDBACK rather than a general comment on this model as a whole. If it&apos;s priced cheap--expect to get what you pay for, that&apos;s a general rule of thumb on ebay."	1
"This is an excellent phone running the Windows Mobile 5 OS. The quality is outstanding, and it is very easy to learn and use. With the Windows Mobile OS you can truly do just about anything you can do on your PC plus have all the conveniences of a cell phone. Sound quality is very good. There are only a couple of drawbacks. The back battery cover is flimsy, so you might want to get a spare. This is a common complaint. The slide-out keyboard is full QWERTY, and easy to use even though a little crowded. With a little practice you get used to it. The touch screen is very responsive but you do have to use a stylus. One comes built-in and you can find spares on eBay for not much (try the ones for Nintendo games). Overall a five-star device and well worth the money."	1
"this is an excellent phone,i&apos;ve been meaning to get one for a while now.it&apos;s very simple to operate."	1
"This is an excellent phone.  The battery life has some to be desired, but with the radio, camera, mp3 player, internet, wifi, and every other option available, it is understandable.  The GPS works great, and talks in voice (with a subscription), which is great.  I use the auto voice announce when people call, so that I know who it is before even picking up the phone.  Custom ring-tones, wallpapers, themes, screen savers, this phone has it all.  Even games.  Excellent, top of the line model from Nokia, sure to be a hit in the US."	1
This is an excellent phone. The service provided us also efficient and excellent. 	1
This is an excellent seller.  The phone was shipped right away and the price was much cheaper than the competitors.	1
"This is an great phone, with good battery life.  Super easy to use."	1
"This is an old fashioned phone but it works great. It works as a phone, is easy to text, and can check email and slowly work the internet. Not fancy but it will do what you need. This is the second one I&apos;ve had- the first lasted a long time and went through a lot."	1
This is an older model to replace a phone I had destroyed.  It has good reception and has the basics that you need in a phone.	1
This is an older style cell phone that my work utilizes and it workes very well. The purchase I made was to replace my old damaged phone and the cost was EXCELLENT as well as the condition of the item received. The transaction was very good and made in the exact way in which Ebay was intended to be used. Both parties were happy and satisfied with the deal and service provided	1
"This is another reminder that you only get what you pay for.  The response on the touch screen is ridiculous.  You have to pound it sometimes.  Battery life is very short, 14 or 15 hours if you are lucky.  Instructions were my first tip off that I probably made a mistake.  They were translated from Chinese and translated poorly.  My two biggest complaints are that the software required to use this thing is sketchy and unreliable.  It screwed with my phone big time.  If I wasn't using the watch for a phone call, even if I had the watch disconnected from my phone, it caused the standard function of a phone call on my cell, not to work.  I had to text with people to communicate.  The second large complaint I have about it, is the range.  This thing will disconnect after 10 feet of separation.  This horrible range makes it un-usable for what I was trying to accomplish with it.  My wife has a hard time keeping track of her phone around the house.  So not only can she not find it on a regular basis, she then does not respond to my texts or phone calls fairly regularly because of that.  The settings are frustrating...you think you have it set for audible ringing and it doesn't ring, vibrates instead.  You think you have turned certain things off, and they still keep showing up.  Even if"	0
This is by far one of the worst tablets ever released.  I bought one for my daughter and even she was .  Not worth$60..  Save your money. 	0
"This is by far the best phone I have ever owned.  For starters, it has the most high quality screen in the world available for a smartphone- 1440 X 2560 for pixels, making it a 2K Quad HD Phone. The only downside of this is that it eats up the battery pretty fast if it's on maximum brightness because it has to support all those pixels.   The Color OS, which is powered by Android Lollipop, is the most customized and convenient UI I have ever seen. It unlocks amazing capabilities like sliding 3 finger to capture screenshots, sliding 2 fingers to adjust volume, pinching the screen to open the camera, etc. You can also use gestures on the screen when it's off to activate things such as the camera and flashlight, and that too is customize-able to meet your preferences. Oh, and you can double tap the screen to wake it up.    The camera is a true work of art. It has a 13 megapixel sensor which can combine multiple shots in Ultra HD Mode to create a 50 megapixel image - though this only works if you have a tripod or something to keep the phone from shaking too much.   If you live in North America, make sure to get the US Version, otherwise you'll be stuck at 3G speeds. I use Straight Talk on the AT&T network as my provider and pay $45 a month for unlimited everything 4G, so it's crucial "	1
"This is by far the best phone I&apos;ve had. I had the samsung instinct before and it was terrible. The EVO has a large screen, perfect for emailing and texting. The keyboard is awesome! Access to the internet and all the apps are great. The camera&apos;s are great also. I think and people I&apos;ve talked to prefer this phone over the iphone."	1
"This is by far the best small sized phone, does almost everything a full sized iPhone does and is much cheaper."	1
This is by far the worst seller I have ever dealt with on eBay. 	0
This is definitely the nicest Android I've ever seen.	1
this is excellent but is it all a joke i mean ive wanted a blackberry for ages and then it said on this one its only a couple of quid is this real.	1
This is factory unlocked! Works with any SIM! The Froyo 2.2 has quite a few improvements over older Android systems. The Dell Stage is nothing to rave about but is just ok. I do not like the text messaging layout over past Andriod versions. The older versions has your comments justified to the right and the other party justified to the left. On Ver. 2.2 everyone is justified to the left making it hard to seperate what you said from what they said. Battery almost makes it though a day so I would recommend getting a few extra cables and a car charger.	1
This is far better than my S7 Edge and gets better gas mileage to the charge.  Once you buy it you'll be glad you did trust me its smooth riding Cadillac disguised as a phone!	1
this is for prepaid plans does not work for post paid plans	0
"This is hard to  explain I use a government phone. My  gov. Issued broke, they said it was to early  for them to replace my phone, so I had to buy one. There was a mess up of the kind of phone that would connect to gov .phone lines this one didn't."	1
"THIS IS INDEED A VERY SMART PHONE, BUT I STILL HAVE NOT FIGURED OUT HOW TO CONNECT TO WIFI WITH IT...LOL."	1
This is just a gaming toy you asking for 900 CAD plus on top of that is not new and is a rebuilt device still o.o! I think for a gaming desktop ASUS brand offer better price then this is not even close to the production cost making this toy.	0
This is just a Quick Note to let People know if they purchase one of these Phones it isn&apos;t tested by UL in the USA.  Also the signal strength on these phones aren&apos;t the best.  When the signal strength is poor it will also drain the battery quicker... Charger may also pose risk for Fire.......	0

THIS IS ME REVIEWING A PRODUCT I WAITED 2 MONTHS FOR AND DIDN'T GET. I WISH I COULD GIVE 0 STARS.	0
"This is my 2nd Note 5. Instead of paying the price for a Note 8, I decided to purchase another 5. The phone came in ""A1 condition.""   My only draw back is battery life is still an issue (and I don't have a lot of running apps on it).  A friend of mine has the Note 8, and he has solid battery life.   Maybe next year, I will get a Note 8, once the price goes down. But for now, the Note 5 checks all of the boxes for most part.(minus battery life) "	1
This is my 2nd time i have ordered from this seller because the first deal the seller went above and beyond what he needed to do for me! so when it was time to buy another phone i came back to this seller just for that reason! Thanks again! 	1
This is my 3rd treo 680 and my 5th palm. The 680 is the most usefull for me. They are very durable and palm has multiple software upgrades at no cost from the palm website	1
This is my 6th purchase of a Samsung SGH A707 Sync cell phone.  I love the way it performs so I have given them to several friends and family.    I was especially impressed when my doctor told me he uses this cell phone.    I use the camera as an addition to my regular digital camera when I&apos;m at my granddaughters performances.      The ability to increase the size of the text and numbers helps my elderly relatives.  My daughter loves the ease of changing the color of the phone and the ease of internet usage.    We have used several name brand phones with my business and this one works easier than most of the expensive ones we have used.  We have determined this is the best cell phone short of an iPhone or PDA.    The A707 Sync has so many features that I can not discuss them all.  I like using the MP3 player when I travel around town and on long waits.	1
"This is my favorite phone ever.  I had another just like it, but it fell into some water and no longer worked.  Even though I may be switching carriers in a couple of months, I liked this phone so much I had to purchase another one to make it through.  It is light, easy to use and very dependable It has a long battery life, which is important to me.  I highly reccomend this phone to anyone!!!"	1
"This is my first iPhone, and I love it!"	1
"This is my first Samsung Galaxy phone and I love it,I highly recommend it."	1
"This is my first smart Phone, and I was pleased to have purchased it. This refurb model is in excellent Physical condition, and it all seemed to work as designed  , , ,for a month.  However, even after re-installing the Android Operating system (v. 4.4.2, the latest one available for this model), the phone will not dial out reliably. Because the phone/Android systems are not current, it seems not possible to upgrade it and get it working properly. I don't know if it's this particular phone, or if all Enacts are this way.  I cannot rely on this phone, it's past the 60 day return time, and I will need to replace it with a  phone that actually makes calls."	0
"This is my first smartphone and first Blackberry purchase.  What a great phone!  I bought it because I have been with Virgin Mobile for years and love their service, package price, and the fact that I don&apos;t have to sign a contract!  This phone does it all, and I&apos;m only paying $35 per month for unlimited web, texting, and 300 minutes of talk time!  I highly recommend this phone, as well as Virgin Mobile!"	1
"This is my first smartphone, and I am extremely impressed.  This phone is freaking  hot.  The functions are awesome, and the android store rules!"	1
this is my first touchscreen cell and i thought initially thought i wouldn&apos;t like it but i love this phone. everything is easy to access and i really can&apos;t flaw this phone in any way. it&apos;s not an iphone so surfing is a tad slow but i don&apos;t surf that much.	1
"This is my fist purchase on ebay, and i was deeply disappointed.i  needed a phone and i bidded for one,but when i got the phone it was not the very one advertised.this is the IMEI# 1067000283240  i bidded for and here is the IMEI# 010627000848406  i got. besides, it does&apos;t hold charge for few hour and when i complained to the seller, he promised to send me a battery that works since i told him i would like to send back the phone.later he changed his mind and started asking money for the cost of the battery he promised.at the monement in using a friend&apos;s phone until i can afford a better one.thanks for your concern about  my opinion on my purchase on ebay.     here is the seller&apos;s mail to me(Date: Tue, 24 Jul 2007 16:10:11 -0700 (PDT)   From:  &quot;P2O&quot; &lt;phonestoown@yahoo.com&gt;  Add to Address Book  Add Mobile Alert   Yahoo!

"This is my most recent phone and by far my favorite.  In the past year I&apos;ve had the Moto X 2013(got it late) and 2014 and the Nexus 5 and 6, and a Huawei Ascend Mate 2. Out of all of them the OnePlus One is my favorite. It has the longest battery life of all of them(except the Huawei). Can be rooted and ROM&apos;d with ease(Nexus easy).  The screen is big and bright. And the camera is fantastic.  If you get the ColorOS Camera app and all of its plugins it makes this camera REALLY shine.  Who doesn&apos;t like a 32 second long exposure for GREAT night time photos.  The screen is on the big side, but I&apos;ve actually came DOWN from 6 inches in the Huawei.     So to wrap it up.  It&apos;s not as big as the Nexus 6 but it&apos;s half the price and the battery is LOT&apos;S longer lasting. Plus, it&apos;s as easy to root and ROM as a Nexus.  The battery doesn&apos;t last as long as the Huawei but the software is the latest and the screen is better resolution."	1
this is my second breeze.  I like the operating system which makes using the phones functions easy.	1
This is my second Droid Razr M and it crashed on me.  This product stinks.  I keep getting the droid eye and it will not boot back up.  I would not purchase this phone again.  I thought it might be a fluke with the first.  So disappointed and frustrated.	0
This is my second Iphone. This is a great value. A great way to get the iPhone experience without iPhone 6 price tag. Does not have all the bells and whistles of the latest but is a great way experience the iPhone without the latest sticker shock.	1
"This is my second Nexus 6P after my original was stolen. Very fast, great screen, love the quick & convenient fingerprint authentication, and good battery life. "	1

"This is my second purchase of a ls995(1st one was stolen) from this vendor. Forget the refurbished and minor scuffs, each phone has been in excellent condition. And arrived on my doorstep withhin  couple of days. All things considered this is the best del on the web. I have had  ls995 since it first came out, so i think i know what im talking about. A little more advice for y, try and get  sim card from  retail outlet while wit for the phone to arrive. The ls995 doest play nice with reused sims u can get and reused card to work but it is difficult.  "	1
This is my second time to buy phone with them I received my items very quicky no delay and good condition.I&apos;m very happy.  Tks	1

"This is not a new iphone. There's a box from another phone. He glued the IMEI number on top of the old IMEI number. I checked, maybe it's a refurbished iphone.  He sent me silver phone, before the phone was black.  Be careful of buying goods from this seller!"	0
This is not a product review since I never received the product and could not contact or even pay seller.    Ebay should have routines to contact members who sign off.    I won the auction for a Nokia cellphone but will never receive it.	0

This is not the phone I thought I was ordering!!! It's supposed to be a at&t go phone but the network keeps bouncing back and forth to Verizon then at&t. Completely got burned think next time I'll shop Amazon maybe i'll have better luck	0
This is NOT worth more than $20.00 as it's obsolete!	0
"This is older technology (and priced accordingly) but overall it does exactly what I need it for. ....to send and receive calls and a very few text messages. It has good battery life (about 3or 4 days on standby, and some less if used a lot). I like the black color."	1
This is one of the best budget phones for the price that this phone is on sale.	1
"This is one of the best phones ever made!! It is very easy to use and you  can make it yours. There are a lot of wallpapers and apps that you  can put on it that makes it even better.(if that is possible)With the purchase of this phone, you  won't be sorry. This is the second one I have bought.the 1st one was for me and now my hubby has one too!! ENJOY~~~~~~ "	1
"This is one of the best phones I have ever owned.  Speakerphone is great, you can understand every word. Takes great pictures and you can download any song you want.  Love it."	1
"This is one of the best phones I've had...first of all it is very affordable, easy to use and it is what I was looking for in a cell phone. The size, it fit easily into your pocket and the ring tones are very clear, no static at all. I love this phone by samsung better than my others. This is the phone I use on a regular basis. There is not anything bad that I can say about the samsung gravity phone. except, Thank you samsung for a well made product."	1
"This is one of the better phones that I&apos;ve owned. It&apos;s small and sleek. It&apos;s easy to use and very easy to personalize. The battery lasts FOREVER and doesn&apos;t take very long at all to charge.  My only problem is with the buttons. My last phone had rather large, &quot;clicky&quot; buttons and this one has very small, soft buttons. It takes some getting used to but it&apos;s totally worth it."	1
"This is one of the easist phones to use I have found.  My husband uses his phone daily for work and this is the only phone he will use.  He doesn&apos;t use texting, internet etc, so he doesn&apos;t need a &quot;fancy&quot; phone.  For dependability and easy use this phone can&apos;t be beat."	1
"This is one of the perfect phones i have bought for my wife, its so amazing that no one will ever wants to downgrade or change the brand. its so easy to use,unique applications, very good camera not forgetting the music part. it has a very good sound. All in all, Iphone is the best in the world."	1
"This is one of the worst cell phones I have ever purchased.  From day 1 there was something wrong with it.  The battery life is horrible and is usually drained by the end of the day.  The pink paint has work off all the corners and the back of the phone.  The back plate that holds the battery in does not attach anymore, so it is currently being held on by scotch tape.  Also, the phone came with no instruction booklet so figuring out how the phone works was a guessing game.  There are times when I am text messaging and the screen will just go completely black and then it takes about a minute or two for it to get back to its normal state.  I am extremely disappointed in this phone and will never order for this seller again."	0
This is one phone that i love dearly. I have had this phone in the past but lost it and when i tried to purchse it again through tmobile they no longer had it avaliable. so her i am buying it on ebay. This phone takes awesome pictures. Love it a must have	1
"This is our second FireFly.  I have heard all the horror stories from my friends, where their kids ring up a huge phone bill ($500 and more).  I personally think they should take the phone away from them, but I bought the Firefly, and my son has used it for 3 years.  Its great that I can set the numbers so he cant call everyone, nor can he text.  Hes 18 now, but not making enough mony to get his own line, so I dont have to worry about it.  I can get ahold of him, or my daughter, and not feel like I am going to go bankrupt, added it for $9 to my existing AT&amp;T account, and they have a way to call me.    I was laid off last year, and a $500 bill would kill me, so this works out great.  Any parent giving a kid a normal phone deserves the bill, if something like this is available."	1
This is perfect for a replacement for a teen small fits in pocket  no butt dialing nice ringtones at a great price We LIKE IT	1
This is phone operates well but on a full charge the battery only last 5 hours.  I've had two of the same phone and they both had poor battery life.	0
This is probably a good product if it arrived in working order which it did not!!! Would not power up!!!  	0

"This is review is about the seller - the item was looking good on the bidding - I paid instantly by PayPal upon winning the phone.  I eventually had a mail from the seller telling me he would not accept PayPal, despite it clearly stating he did.  I than had to get the money back from PayPay and issue a cheque - all takes time. Eventually the phone arrived, in a reused envelope with a small amount of bubble wrap around the phone. Amazingly the phone was not broken into tiny pieces. The phone was in a disgusting state. Dirty, and very &apos;hacked at&apos; inside. The SIM connector had undergone some very crude soldering, with part of it damaged, rendering it unuseable. Also around the card holder was &apos;bathroom sealant&apos;, heavens knows why. A lesson learned here. 70.00p gone, it will end up in the bin."	0

"This is simply best used android phone out there under $75.  Galaxy SII is where samsung made quantum jump from mediocre phone to outstanding phone.  Since then, Galaxy S3 and S4 have been incremental upgrades, and SII is still very good.  Sprint version comes with 4.5&quot; screen which is even better than SII for other carriers (4.3&quot; screen).  This phone can be upgraded to latest android Kitkat 4.3 using cyanogenmod which is great.  I have Galaxy note 2 as well, but this phone is also a very good performer with few drawbacks."	1
"This is such an awesomely durable phone.  It&apos;s not loaded to the gills with crapware, and it just got even better now that T-Mobile is upgrading to HSPA!"	1
"This is the 2nd LG Phone that I have had in the past two years. The first stopped working after about a year. It was an issue with the ribbon cable between the two sides of the phone. This phone did not work our of the package. It was not a new item, but it was refurbished. The charger would not charge the battery. The 2 button would just randomly push over and over. Many problems with this phone."	0

"This is the 4th V3 I have purchased for different family members. It is a simple phone to use, don&apos;t have a lot of bells and whistles but that is what I like. It is stylish, compact and has a large screen. Camera pixel not high but it is a cell phone and I didn&apos;t buy it for the camera."	1
"This is the ABSOLUTE WORST transaction I've ever had on EBay. I buy absolutely everything on EBay, I literally shop on eBay every week, almost every other day , and I have for NEVER had this kind of experience. Unbelievably Horrible. As soon as I received the phones I took them to Sprint and Sprint said that they were  unusable, when I try to return them. The seller declined. I wouldn't of even minded an exchange but to just blatantly disregard your customer and not even try and resolve the matter in someway is just awful. I would never ever ever shop with them and I wouldn't advise anyone to either. I will not discontinue my usage of eBay just this seller. So terrible. "	0
"This is the best galaxy I have used. Beautiful screen, long battery life, and I love the pen. I use it all the time. This phone is fun to use. Love it and highly recommend it. "	1
"This is the best phone available today, and it isn&apos;t close.  3 of my friends has an iPhone 4 and the competition isn&apos;t even worth discussing.  The Evo is much faster, more fun, apps are cheaper on the andriod market, and overall more fun to use."	1
this is the best phone i could find as it connects to your computer with the motorola phone tools software with which you can do loads of stuff including making ringtones and videos for the phone .	1
This is the best phone I have ever had! Better than the Iphone. Vivid screen easy to navigate through the phone. I like all the different features and the clarity of videos and photos. It is lighter and has a bigger screen than most touch screens I have seen.	1
"this is the best phone i have ever had. very fast, camera works good,and the screen size is perfect i recommend this phone to any one    "	1
This is the best phone I have had compared to all iPhones and Samsung phones I have owned. Looooong life battery.	1
"This is the best phone of its generation in any features.  I used many years w810i, after this it was hard to change it new touch-screen or qwerty phones. I searched many places, but couldn&apos;t find suitable phone with good music and camera. So I bought from ebay (thanks to ordinaryworld) about 130$ with shipping. Now I use wi-fi, 8mp camera,as a walkman with 8gb memory,many other features and charge it 2-3 times per week.   In one words recommend to all SE lovers."	1
This is the best phone that I have ever owned! I like everything about it. I can use it without touching it! The battery last me all day and then I charge it overnight. It also keeps quiet from 10pm to 6am while I am sleeping. It has plenty of space for everything I need. It takes great pictures and 4k videos. It has a fantastic 1080 HD screen. I would recommend this phone to anyone that ask.	1
"This is the best phone, the Touch ID is very responsive and protects my info."	1
This is the best slider phone on the market.  Fast and so easy to use.  My husband loves the qwerty keyboard for texting.	1
this is the best sprint phone ever put out so far. yeah its no razar (not small) but it has the best sound. this phone sounds like a loud speaker. stroage is so great( even without the minisd card). it is kinda big but it blows u away with what it can do... if you are offered a great price on this phone...DO NOT PASS IT UP... this phone is like the god of all phones	1
"This is the contract phone, certainly not from apple store.A liar "	0
"This is the first LG phone that I do not like. I bought it because it has the Lollipop software version, but had no idea what the phone itself was really like. It has no notification lights! That to me is unfathomable! The only way you can find out if the battery is fully charged, check to see if you have any messages, etc., is to pick the phone up and activate the screen. I did find a program called NoLED that I have to use to make up for the loss of notification LEDs. I also find that the area where you type text messages is so small that it's almost impossible to use the correction tool. And one more thing- the camera constantly turns itself on when I do not want it on! How that happens is beyond me. That causes the phone to heat up! I wish I'd stayed with my old LG, version 4, instead of this thing!"	0
This is the first time I do this experience with my eBay. This seller doesn't respect himself 	0
"This is the fourth iteration of what is perhaps the most popular phone in cell phone history. Now featuring a higher-resolution &quot;RETINA&quot; screen, 5MP auto-focus camera with LED flash, 720p HD video recording, FaceTime, and a slew of other features, this iPhone 4 has all other companies going back to the drawing board yet again."	1
This is the hottest phone out on the market if you are a Sprint customer. You can&apos;t go wrong with is phone. The only down side to the phone is the battery life.	1
"This is the modern 64 bit iPhone in the all metal case of the iPhone 5.  It's a little brick, does it all.  I have wanted to keep the iPhone 5 size ever since I got one.  The SE is a fast, powerful little machine.   "	1
This is the most wonderful phone I have ever own. I decided to buy this phone due   to the reputation it has overall.	1
This is the only phone on the market that is built for industrial us...it is very practical and the wifi uma used with tmobile works flawless....even after the phone update I have found a solution to the wifi uma working	1
"This is the perfect phone for those who just want to make & receive calls, as well as retrieve voicemail. This is all we actually wanted in a cell phone because it's simple & easy to use. It does have other features, but we do not use or need them. Tried a ""smart"" phone for more than a year & found it too complicated when all I wanted are a few basic features. The size is nice as well. Had zero difficulty entering contacts, choosing ring tone & volume, etc. I recommend this phone for anyone who just needs a phone for what they were intended to do in the first place.  "	1
"This is the phone I should have purchased instead of the S6 Edge! More features, such as water resistant ,upgradeable SD card, and replaceable battery.  Why Samsung went backwards I'll never understand. "	1
This is the Samsung that is the flagship and I can use bluetooth to listen to music all day when I ski and still take calls	1
This is the second Epix purchase.  Battery life is very good unless you surf alot on the Web. I use for text and calls mainly.  Mouse is very user friendly and fixed Qwerty keyboard is great.	1
"This is the second iPhone 6 plus I've had, and it is a good phone.  This phone is very slippery (like a wet bar of soap) so get a good non-slippery case for it.  This so-called ""unlocked phone""  arrived locked to At&T.  My carrier (T-Mobile) wouldn't unlock it, so I messaged the seller who told me they check every   phone they sell and offered no help at all.  After much time and effort I got AT&T to unlock it for me (I did the sellers job for them)."	0
"This is the second Moto I've owned. The first a Moto E, which was a great phone, and now the Moto G4. This is an excellent phone, its fast, reliable and I love the 5.5 inch screen. You can't go wrong with Motorola/Lenovo. "	1
This is the second phone I buy from them . They have excellent customer service . Any problems get fixed quickly. Great job!	1
This is the second phone I received from this company. The first had a bad battery and was the wrong color. The second has a problem locking up.	0
This is the second phone they have shipped me that does not work 	0
"This is the second SCH U640 I have bought. The first one is 3yrs old, it works just fine yet, I just needed to get a battery for it once. It shows a little wear from use, and dropping it a few times, etc. It is a tough little phone, fits in your pocket, has good sound, speaker phone feature works good, and has a lot of features. The only reason I bought another one is because I needed a back up, because I drive a truck. All I ever needed was a phone, I link my Blue Parrot headset to it, I like the pictures and videos it takes, and I also use it as a alarm clock."	1
"this is the second time on this site that i have been duped by lies written on the screen. once more i purchase a &quot;T Mobile&quot; phone with internet and mms, and for the second time neither of those features work...this sucks!"	0
"This is the third android maxx i have,  ordered. It is such a wonderful bargain, plus the sound playing music is awesome. i recommend this iphone ."	1
"This is the tracking #( 9505516003887086084379) I just returned this phone because doesn't work, it is locked and can't activate with any company, thank you, after you receive this item please deposit my full refund to my PayPal account."	0
this is the worse phone i ever purchased in my life it has had so many glitches and ive had to reboot the phone losing all my personal stuff in the phone 2 times..and now it wont do anything at all....	0
"this is the worst experience in buying anything. almost 2 months later and i still don&apos;t have the phone. he never bothered to contact me,I had to contact him and he gave me some excuse about why i haven&apos;t got it yet and that he will resend it. That was like three weeks ago and i still haven&apos;t got it. I am staying away from this seller as far as the east is from the west."	0
"This is the worst phone ever, the service is shotty if you have at&t be warned that even if your in coverage area it will bounce in and outta service cause a defect in marshmellow os, some apps dont work. Overall this is a bad phone."	0
This is the worst phone i have EVER had! Do not buy it! I am on my 3ed warranty replacement and they all have had the same problems even without any apps downloaded off the market! It freezes up and locks itself all the time. WORST PHONE EVER.	0
This is the worst seller I meet. Be careful he is a liar. He sold me an iPhone which was locked. It provides liyuu information. Don't believe him.	0
This is the worst smartphone! My text messages don&apos;t send most of the time. The battery life is short. It&apos;s just a piece of junk! What a waste of $100.00!	0
this is to be a boost mobile phone that is now listed as a boost phone if it wont work for boost i am going to be angry	0
This is used phone not new .... And seller is ******	0
"This Is very fake phone,   poor battery life, charging port is not well fixed   they put own lines for charging port   It&apos;s seller repair and said new phone.   The phone I got I am sure it&apos;s fake product/ manufacture rubbished one.      I have open the phone and through digital microscope I checked, If you want I will make video and link it to you"	0
"This is very good phone ,long life battery, it works great ."	1
This is what someone can call a real smartphone !! Good battery life and is very easy to use.............	1
This is worth every penny. I don&apos;t have any problems in using the phone. Very basic for people who do minimum texting.	1
"This isnt a comment on the seller. This is a terrible phone, I&apos;ve had two of them one from Verizon and one from an Ebay seller. Both times the mini-USB port will start to fail on you after about 6 months of use. At first it starts acting funny when you plug it in (not instantly recognizing that it is plugged in) after awhile you&apos;ll have to start pulling the cord one way or another. Finally even when plugged in a not moving it will just stop charging."	0
"This item appeared to be in very good condition and I loved the fact of the details provided by the vendor.  The item, when I recieved, was exactly as pictured.  I purchased this phone for someone and they love it and say that it is working wonderfully.  Plan to use this company again for phone purchases.  Want to add that the delivery was very rapid."	1
This item came with water damage and was unable to be activated at the Cricket Store. I opened a claim for resolution; however this seller does not respond or communicate at all. Not a good experience for such a new seller! Horrible product and not as described.	0
This item does not include free shipping. The post office will send you a fee of the shipping cost. 	0
THIS ITEM HAS BEEN RECALLED! Samsung is sending fireproof boxes for returns so they're pretty serious about not wanting anyone to use them. Why are you trying to sell this & risking people's lives instead of getting your refund? DO NOT TAKE A CHANCE ON BUYING THIS PHONE!	0

This item is defective....brand new in box and it doesn't work properly.  I now have to contact the manufacturer if I want any resolution to this problem.	0
This item is in violation of federal laws in trafficking in counterfeit products.	0
"This item is new, seller represented item accurately and was honest and easy to work with. As soon as seller was paid, the item was shipped to me."	1
This item is not what lister say&apos;s. I live very near person that listed item and ask to be able to see item before paying for it to make sure it&apos;s what lister says. Lister refuse&apos;s to co-operate and allow me to make sure item works as listed. I would recomend no one do business with this lister.	0
"This item is so good and well priced and absolutely unlocked I have to order twice. I ordered them as presents for my relatives back in a foreign country. The unit works great as long as you have the GSM Network for any local carrier in the country. For a price less than $60, you cannot beat this smartphone. It even comes with a GPS and can also be used as an MP3 player. The only drawback is it is a single camera and doesn&apos;t have a flash. But for less than $60 what else can you complain?"	1
This Item Is Stolen.. This is a stolen item.. I don&apos;t like it. Sad that people have to take from other.. I don&apos;t want to buy thing that some one stole.. Get a job	0
This item is water damaged!	0
this item only worked for 2 days before becoming useless at performing what it was bought for. Unfortunately I am still waiting for a response on the return request I submitted roughly 3-4 days ago so I can again try to replace my personal cellular phone. 	0
"This Item the most likely I have had. I am very glad to buy it and I hope not to buy another different one.    The only dislike I have it is not with the Item, it was suppose to be unlocked and it was a little difficult for me to unlock due to not receive any answer nor support from seller.    By the way, deffinitively I am very glad with the Item"	1
this item was a piece of junk and i want my money back. none should be allowed to sell this kind of junk to hard working people.	0
"This item was advertised as being absolutely new and unused. However, the piece I received was clearly used, with signs of wear and even damage. The box was a white cardboard box with the Sony Ericsson logo printed on it and nothing else, clearly fake. Inside the box, the earplugs and the charger were also labeled Sony Ericsson, but the overall build was poor, clearly not manufactured by Sony Ericsson. No manual or other documentation accompanied the phone. In sum, a total fluke. Steer clear!"	0
This item was certainly NOT as described it was said it would work with my carrier and it does not and its ugly.  Pretty much got told to bad not my problem.  I will NEVER buy from this seller again.	0
This item was described accurately. .. The shipping was lighting fast as well! Would definitely do business with seller again!  Thanks! 	1
"This item was fairly priced (saved nearly $350.00 over purchasing from my service provider!), new and exactly what I was looking for. I received this item quickly (within 2 business days) and arrived in the same condition as described. This seller took extra caution in requiring a signature, which I appreciate! I highly recommend looking to this seller for your cell phone needs!"	1
This item was listed as 32gb however the phone I received was a 16gb when I advised the seller of what I received was told they know what was sent. I provide photo of storage capacity and provider imei#. The seller offered for me to send phone back however insisted that a 32gb is sent. This phone was in great condition as described just a major discrepancy with storage size. 	0
"This item was never received , never sent by seller    I will tell the community : NEVER BUY FROM THIS SELLER      thanks, padelgado"	0
"This item was not as describe. It says BRAND NEW AND NEVER BEEN ACTIVATED, BUT IT WAS ALREADY ACTIVATED IN SOMEONE ELSE NAME. So i contact the seller, and it was very hard to get in touch with seller. I Had to email him over 15times, this seller customer service is HORRIBLE! it took forever for me to get my refund. The seller also tells me that he&apos;s going to cover the shipping cost. It&apos;s been almost a month, and i still did not get my refund for the shipping cost. I emailed him again, like 4times, and still no response. I don&apos;t like to leave negative feedback, But i&apos;m very pissed off about this seller. If you buy something from this seller, please be careful. i got ripped off, and i am going to report this seller to eBay and have them deal with this, because this is ridiculous. HORRIBLE SELLER!! PLEASE BEWARE!!!"	0
"This item was purchased for only as needed use intended. Used infrequently. Phone is turned on when my mom is not in her apt, in case she has an emergency or we need to reach her if shes out. Battery does not hold a charge. Indicates charged and very quickly battery is completely dead. Very disappointed with this item. Basically this phone has been useless and total waste of $38. "	0
"This item was returned for malfunction and the seller did not refund back, now the seller is trying to re-sell this item, it is a fraud."	0
"This item was unsatisfactory, wrong advertized on the actual phone, missing charger, case, missing screw on the charger input, batery is bad.wont hold charge,earphone does not work..i wont buy another item this seller again...J.Agabin"	0
"This item works PERFECTLY... The battery life, signal reception, user ability, and very stylish. The display is crystal clear when view web pages and the camera takes great photos that are easily shared with friends with one click of a button. I made a great choice with this phone."	1
"this its the fast-best phone that I have in my hands, its an amazing, beautiful, great phone, its fast, its the best screen resolution, the life battery its excelent because I dont need to worry about charging..."	1
This kind of action is not acceptable	0
This lady said nothing about the phone being an all tel phone. I needed a Verizon phone and was assured that this was a VERIZON phone. I was misled by this lady. My cell phone service is through Verizon so I needed a Verizon phone to get it activated. I&amp;apos;m very upset and feel deceived. This lady is what&amp;apos;s wrong with ebay!!!!	0
This LG G4 has a serious heating problem. It gets hot even from the most simple usage. It gets so hot that it can hurt to touch it to ones ear. The specs are very tempting and so is the price but it comes at a terrible price. 	0
This Listing is a scam. He will not give you the IMEI number till you make a bid he likes. The number in the pic says that it is Financial Eligibility  Device is not eligible for resale (financed).                                                             BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	0
"This little phone has tons of features! I love the fact that I can put it in my pocket and it is so compact, and it will not &quot;pocket dial&quot; anyone! Had a few bar phones that I would forget to put on button lock and they would &quot;pocket dial&quot; my contacts! This phone you just slide it down and it is in the key locked automatically! Love the keyboard too! So much easier then using regular phone pad for texting or emailing."	1
This little phone really impressed me its small simple durable and has a loud ring I recomend it to any one who wants a phone that is not complicated it has worked great for me	1
This lumia Phone is a Wonderful at a even better price.. Performs just as smooth and sleek as other high price phones. Would recommend to anyone who likes the Windows os  	1
this man never answered and lost $ 850 and I did not get my purchase was not delivered to me with a signature and according to this seller I had insurance and the insurance does not make it worth maybe I already charge it and he does not answer me	0
"This mobile is refurbished, is not new. The keyboard is not working. I dont recommend this mobile nor the seller."	0
"This mobile phone is very bad because I bought this mobile phone but l saw that hasnt  head phone and original charger and the board of mobile phone had problems.Then l send back the mobile and I pay 13 Canadian dollars but he did not return the shipping cost to me, due to the fact that the problem was from their side."	0
"This model is known for having microphone problems. This makes it difficult to understand on the other end of call.    The phone likely had not been checked out prior to shipping.  Having said that, the seller had no problem with returns."	0
"This my friends, is a Samsung Note 2 CLONE. It does work with my T-Mobile sim card, but I can not access my internet. It also shows &quot;INVALID IMEI&quot; on the phone when you pull down the drop menu. With that said, your carrier probably will not acknowledge this phone for insurance purposes. Ive read this will work with other carriers, but whats the point? I am already with T-Mo? Im not even sure if the GPS works, as I boxed it back up and filed a dispute with the seller tho eBay/Paypal. If the seller advertised this as a CLONE, then by all means, use it in EUROPE or ASIA where they dont need IMEI numbers as US carriers do! Be advised people, this is NOT an original Samsung NOTE 2!"	0
This Nokia is for my hubby valentine day&apos;s. Before that he use iphone3gs and he really don&apos;t like it. He said his notes keep loose. When he use nokia E63 he never get that problem so that why i have to find Nokia for him again. Now he got Nokia E5-00 and he just really love nokia.	1
This Nokia Lumia 630 is a very nice phone for my daughter.  This windows based phone can easily sync with her laptop.  Works well except there is no rear facing camera.	1
This note 4 had discovered when I went to take the screen I had glued the flex with silicone to fit the base that damaged the flex and was no longer useful	0
This old Nokia phone is (IMHO) the greatest Pnone of the classsical GSM phone generation! I use this Nokia as the second mobile (the first one is  Android phone) and I like to take this solid gadget and simply hold it in my palm :-)	1
"This order was an excellent experience. I thought the phone I ordered was used, but I found it to be new or referbished. I will do business with Blue Bay again. Thank you for a fantastic experience."	1
This package never came	0
"This particular LG Shine phone had UNDISCLOSED WATER DAMAGE (BIG RED CIRCLE INDICATOR ON THE INSIDE), so NOTHING was salvageable on it for parts!"	0
This particular Motorola i1 is a piece of junk. I cannot rate it because 1/3 of the touch screen does not respond to touch. We could not make it work even after we spent 2 hours with Sprint/Nextel on the phone.	0
"This particular phone its a great machine overall.     Its small, has MP3 player, perfect 2.0 mpx Camera, MS DUO slot. Add to this accesories like the ones I got in this auction a Add-on extra flash, a RCA converter to take your MP3 just about everywhere and a 2gb memory card and you have a phone everyone would love.    Only negative point its that the screen  gets easily scratched, so a screen protector will come in handy."	1
"This particular phone's Voice mail set up is only in Spanish; even when the set up says 'answer in English' is still answers in Spanish; I can't use this particular phone due to this as I do not fluently speak that language, rather English. it has many serviceable and fine features but since it appears the software has been altered, the Voice mail is no good for me, which makes it not useable for my family & friends to leave me messages understandable to me. I will not use this phone for this reason, though if I'd gotten a used one that allowed English to be used to both answer and take Voice mails in English, that is what I'd have preferred. "	0
"This particular unit has a real problem with battery life.  Also, it seems that there is a problem with the internal connection for the charger.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn&apos;t.  Not the seller&apos;s fault...it tests OK, but then just doesn&apos;t work a half hour later."	0
This person did not just sold me a defective item he sold me a piece of crap and make me lost my time with unlimited messages about returning my money and a hole month after I'm out of 60$$ and no longer answers. 	0
This person has used my personal information to open a phone service without me knowing or asking me at all now they will not give me any of that information to fix the phone to be able to change services. I just wanted to purchase the phone not phone service! Now I can't do nothing except try to contact eBay.	0
This person is a thief and is already reported to Metro Police for sterling my phone.	0
This person knew the phone was rubbish and still put sales as it may be easy to fix maybe not ..	0
This person sent me a locked phone. And I paid for an unlocked phone. And didnt get me a solution. Be careful when buy a phone to this seller 	0
this person sent us a phone that was supposed to be unlocked and wasnt and also had internal software problems! then when we try send it back they wont contact us with the info!	0
This person soled me a phone that doesnt work. NEVER BUY From this person. I personally got  bamboozled thankfully I didnt pay so much for the phone. But this person is a shady I personally wouldnt buy from them again. They sole me a phone then reported it stolen. 	0
This person won&apos;t reply to your email.  His not going to refund your money and keep the item when you returned to him.	0
"This phoen is one of tracfone&apos;s higher end phones, basically because the other phones they offer are basic. This phone is a slider with a 1.3 MP camera and bluetooth, and honestly works VERY well. I really loved how good reception was on this phone, it seemed to me the one I tested with had excellent reception at ALL times, so that&apos;s also something good about the service. It is also very cheap, cards don&apos;t cost much, and minutes aren&apos;t a rip off. The one con I can think of, but this phone is so nice so it doesn&apos;t need a con mentioned: is the browser UP key. It launches you in the web, and you don&apos;t know it sometimes. So you waste your minutes without you knowin&apos; you are.  It is rip-off-ish (not even sure if I used a correct word LOL) because you wonder why minutes are missing, and you don&apos;t figure out why until it happens again to you. This phone will work for you, and is very easy to use. you&apos;ll love it."	1
this phon is lock i have to pay some mony to unlocked and is not new is he say   i will never buy from this guy agin	0
"This phone (Blackberry ) was advertised as being remanufactured by the manufacturer.The Blackberry I was sent was not redone, it must be at least 5 years old is very dirty. Has a battery in it that does not belong to it. The add read the phone was with bell mobility, it isn&amp;apos;t it is with telus. I was charged double the amount that it really costs for shipping $20 and it was just sent standard mail $10 with no signature and no insurance . I sent a email with my concerns and was not even given a reply!"	0
This phone also did not come with a sim card. When I took out in to sprint they replaced it because out was broke. At least I got lucky with sprint. Sent in my husband.	0
This phone arrived broken. So I spent all that money and waited for a broken phone to arrive.. such a waste of time 	0
This phone arrived in excellent condition looks brand new.  No scratches or marks I would buy again.  Fast delivery.	1
This phone arrived which one SIM card slot broken it is a used machine so I'm assuming it was never tested before it left that's why it's only getting one star when you sell a used machine you must make sure everything works when you say like new	0
"This phone at first was the best thing I have ever bought from Ebay, but after two weeks or before it began to mess up. This was a HUGE waste of my money and time. Save your money, don't buy this.. PIECE OF CRAP.. The saler was nice, but this phone was not what i expected it to be. It is now in my burn pile waiting to be burnt. "	0
"This phone brand is awesome, it meets all my expectations."	1
"This phone came as seen in picture, so far it has been great!"	1
"This phone came in average shape. I filed a claim with ebay got a claim number and tried to go further with ebay. The seller has no returns and she had listed it as NEW - mint cond. The phone came it has scratchs on the front and back. It was also in spanish, when I emailed her for help she gave me the instructions in english. Luckly AT&amp;T cust. service helped me. This phone had been used for a while. It had all kinds of spanish music and tones on it. According to ebay, New means unopened in new box. This phone was far from it and when I tried to contact ebay I never got a response. I sent numerous messages to ebay and nothing. So eBay Buyer Protection is just a JOKE."	0
This phone came trouble in touch malfunctions have problem I want a solution as quickly as possible. that in detail says good condition	0

This phone could not be activated.  When I called to activate the device I was informed that this was stolen....nice...	0
This phone did not even work and I could never get ahold of the seller.I wish I could say more about this phone but that is all I know.	0
This phone did not work and randomly scrambled from screen to screen...did not keep this phone.  The phone appears to be fine but when you put your own sim card in it would not stay on the screen long enough to dial a number.  All info was for the UK.	0
This phone did not work. We received it quickly though. The seller did offer to refund the money if I mailed out the product back to him. But is was going to cost me more to ship it back then what I paid for the phone.	0
This phone didn't come with a sim card so I can't even use it!  And yes I tried using my own sim card. What a waste not happy at all.	0
This phone didn't show up in the davit said in the tracker. Then when we got it the phone has been wet and will not read a Sim card. Horiable Horiable. 	0
This phone different phone I ordered  I order ata or t-mobile they send to me for virzen 	0
This phone does all I need it to do. The third one like it I've owned............only style I've ever used. Thanks.	1
"this phone does everything that anti-iphone customers wants! only negative is the flash is not xenon like on the N82. asides from that, great styling, great apps, great sound, great reception, great compliments. i love this phone...i am definitely taking care of this one."	1
"This phone does have a lot of good features, great screen resolution, good call quality and feels very solid.    But, for me, all of those positives are cancelled out by these three issues: 1) it begins to overheat almost immediately if you use it for anything other than phone calls (and sometimes even then); 2) the battery drains so fast you can almost watch it if you use it for anything other than phone calls; and 3) if you allow or are forced to allow the battery to deplete to the point that the phone shuts down, it cannot be turned back on for 20-30 minutes, even if connected to the charger.  That is SO frustrating.  The fact that I didn&apos;t pay very much for a smartphone is not a valid argument in the phone&apos;s favor.  I would have happily paid more to have a phone that didn&apos;t dictate to me how long I can use it or what I can use it for without it melting down in my hand."	0
"This phone does it all.  Fast processor, good camera and LOTS of memory.  Plus, it holds a HUGE micro SD card (not included).  Being unlocked, I can swap out the sim from my US provider and slip in a sim when traveling in Peru.  After my experience with this LG phone, I'll never go back to Samsung again!  I was a little cautious to buy a phone via internet sales (ebay or not) but THIS phone from THIS vendor is exactly as described and exactly what I asked for and needed.  "	1
This phone does not activate with Boost Mobile. I bought two and Boost Mobile could not activate them. 	0
This phone does not connect to any internet services via WiFi. As a matter of fact is dosent even show in the WiFi settings any open WiFi portals to use it just keeps searching. The phone cannot be updated because it cant connect to WiFi therefore the FaceTime option doesnt work and downloads of certain apps cannot be downloaded because of the connection problem with WiFi 	0
"This phone does not hold a charge, it gets hot and turns off by itself.  I believe the seller knew about it and didn&apos;t divulge."	0
This phone does not take a SIM card I can't use it. Waste of $	0
This phone does not work good at all. It drops calls all of the time. It would be nice to exchange it for one that will work!    Garry	0
this phone does not work right the touch screen is junk when you tap on a letter to put in a name it puts in a total diff number.......not happy at all	0
"This phone does not work with the TouchPad. I purchased this phone expecting the tech reviews and HP&apos;s website to be accurate. I was mistaken. Touch To Share (TTS) does not work. Shared SMS (text) messaging does not work. Phone calls don&apos;t work (i.e. speaker phone echoes horribly for the recipient and mic&apos;d headphones lose audio). Switching from the iPhone4 to this Veer was a major disappointment; especially, because I changed for many of the features that are inoperative. Also, while trying to get customer support for the inoperative features, HP could not and would not help, and AT&amp;T reps didn&apos;t even know what the phone was or that they were selling it. I was trying to combine the TouchPad and Veer to get rid of the iPhone. This endeavor was an epic failure!"	0
this phone does not work. I am very disappointed	0
"This phone doesn&apos;t take pictures, shuts off for no apparent reason, does not recieve text messages and doesn&apos;t alert of incoming call.  I expected to be satisfied but I am very unsatisfied.  I would like a different phone or a refund."	0

This phone drains power very quickly. It has to be charged more than 3 times in a day. Its not for the value that I paid for. In short I over paid for this phone. The seller never mentioned it in his distribution.	0

This phone gave me a hard time because l thought it was unlocked but when l gave it to my sister to use with a gsm sim card they charged a lot of my. Beside this the phone is good	1
"This phone got to be a even faster one with the Symbian Anna update but gave a better all around interface experience when matured into Symbian Belle OS. Nokia has held back this Belle update in many regions so getting this phone with the update is a must. Average phone use with data will give you almost 2 days of running battery life without the need to recharge, decent for a smartphone. The camera features and the HDMI video connection give the sense of having a need for a separate camera or video recording device covered. If you have this phone and want to get the best of the Carl Zeiss Tessar 2.8/28 12MP AF lens for camera still pictures or video recording, you really need to get an expansion 32GB class 4 memory card for proper media recording speed and storing capacity. No Iphone or Android phone out there that can match the quality pictures of this Nokia phone. Also if you like to carry your multimedia with you, the FM transmitter on this phone will let you stream to the car with great sound quality. You will get free apps like skype, youtube, Shazaam, quickoffice, free Ovi maps for GPS use, and facebook and twitter social networking, so there is little need for a lot of smartphone comparison."	1
This phone had difficulty charging then wouldn&apos;t turn on at all.  I took it to a verizon store to have the battery checked out and they said that wasn&apos;t the problem- it was the phone itself and couldn&apos;t be fixed.  The company gave me a full refund	0
"This phone had to many problems, won&apos;t buy again.  I bought it for my husband and he hated it.  The touch screen was seriously flawed."	0
"This phone has &quot;okay&quot; features, but it doesn&apos;t last very long at all. This is a very poorly made phone &amp; I would not recommend this phone to anyone ever. I sent this phone back immediately when I got it. I thought maybe it was just that the owner hadn&apos;t taken care of it because the screen worked for about 3 minutes (not exaggerating) and it quit.  So I ordered another one just like it on E-bay, and this one the screen didn&apos;t work from the start. So that makes 2 phones in less than a week that I bought that didn&apos;t work. I went online to see if there was a way to fix the screen problem because when the screen doesn&apos;t work, you can&apos;t do anything with the phone and come to find out, these screens go out on a regular basis, I read at least 20 stories of this happening.  DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!"	0
This phone has a bad ESN. I was not aware that this phone does not work when I bought it. 	0
"This phone has a glitch (the lock screen/sleep screen keeps popping up while in the middle of transactions or scrolling through facebook) and especially but not limited to when the battery is low. I can't help but feel like this was happening before this was sold, which is probably why it was for sale. States it was tested for 100% functionality but if that were true then it would be noted that it does have a glitch. Not happy."	0
This phone has a lot of functions and works good. It is light and easy to carry. The shipping and delivery was propmt. I like this phone and would recommend it to people who like samasung.	1
"This phone has a major flaw (with no fix) where you cannot use VOIP phone apps with it like skype, nimbuzz, friendcaller, csipsimple, sipdroid, truphone etc.     The sound comes out of the back speakerphone and there is no way to fix it. The phone also locks up a lot, especially when the battery is low. the phone gets really slow and battery dies fast...u have to charge it 4 times a day and it takes over an hour to fully charge.    It freezes and I constantly have to pry the back open and take the battery out and put it back in and reboot. I read this complaint from hundreds of others right after I bought my phone and THEY WERE RIGHT!!!"	0
"This phone has a poor signal, and drops calls. The internet is really slow also. Would not recomend phone for business use."	0
"This phone has all the features that I needed. When I talk on the phone, I can clearly hear the other person&apos;s voice with the voice clarity. The mp3 player and the camera is exceptional. The mp3 player could use a little tweaking to make it better since it won&apos;t recognize an mp3 format at times. The 3.2mp camera takes excellent shots as long as the scenery is still. Text messaging is a breeze. Customizing ring tones is easy with the samsung program. I have a 1gb micro sd card and it works great in the phone. I also downloaded more java games onto the d900. I also was able to watch a movie on this phone. The physical appearance of the phone is very slim and stylish and will get attention from others.     I think the only downside in my opinion is the phone book. I have trouble adding caller id image or ring tone to contacts since I have to add the contact from the sim to the phone so I have two same contacts. Also, plan on buying a case for this phone since even though it is durable, you don&apos;t want to drop it. You can&apos;t find faceplates or anything to replace the oem."	1
"This phone has all the things you need, very good signal"	1
"This phone has an old Gingerbread Android on it, and there are set apps that run, keeping the battery down. It is an open international phone that is limited greatly due to the type of android that it is compatible with."	0
"This phone has been a big hit in Europe, where people drool over the features and qwerty keyboard - it has a great little camera, an MP3 player, a pull email ability and a mini-internet browser.  The phone is fully 3G running off a Symbian 60 OS and of course features the reliability of Nokia.      You won&apos;t find this phone new in the US anymore - Nokia US has discontinued it, but Nokia Europe offers it, and it is offered in most other places in the world.  Make sure you get 2nd generation and also update the software when you get it...but otherwise happy browsing and texting!"	1
this phone has been completely worthless. All parts were spoiled.    this phone has been completely worthless. All parts were spoiled.	0
"This phone has been GREAT for me with probably the best reception in almost all situations. When my friends don&apos;t have a signal, I do. It is a shame Sprint does not sell this phone any more in South Louisiana. It is not as cool as a flip phone but it&apos;s a GREAT business phone. Highly Recommended."	1
This phone has been nothing but problems. Apps crash constantly and the voice cuts out during calls all the time. 	0
"This phone has cool features, and takes awesome pictures. MP3 player is cool because I can put songs on the phone from my computer, and since I like having different tringers, I can use these as ringers. Only downfall is that there isn&apos;t a lot of phone memory to put a lot of songs on the phone. You can put some on the memory card, and can always purchase a bigger memory card(which I&apos;m considering since I like the music on my phone.) As far as size, I don&apos;t really think it&apos;s that big. It fits in any of my pockets no problem. The battery is typical of Nokia&apos;s, and holds a charge for a few days no problem. Lot better than my last phone held one."	1
This phone has everything I need in a cell phone and more. I love the easy way things can be done. It is fast and lasts days on a full charge. Great value for the money.	1
"This phone has exceeded my expectations.  This is an app for anything you can think of.  The Google maps/GPS navigation is better than my stand alone GPS.  The touchscreen keyboard and dialer work well and have the option of tactile feedback when you press a key.  The menus and navigation are quite intuitive and beat Win Mobile hands down, and this is from someone who likes and is very familiar windows desktop OS&apos;s. With add-on software (Touchdown), it handles exchange email perfectly."	1
"This phone has high quality  Built-in wifi, camera, flash  good user interface, I like this phone  I recommend it, is different from the previous bold 9000  now comes with trackpad"	1
"THIS PHONE HAS IT ALL IT IS STYLISH FUNTIONAL AND VERY WELL PUT TOGETHER.  THIS PHONE IS A GOOD BUY! WITH FEATURES LIKE BLUETOOTH, MP3, EVDEO HIGH SPEED INTERNET, SPRINT TV AND GPS AND ALSO SIRUS RADIO IT IS AN OFFER YOU SHOULDN&apos;T TURN DOWN"	1
"This phone has it all. It can take a beating and keep on working. I have ridden my horse with this phone, dropped it, stepped on it (of course not on purpose) and it still works like a gem."	1
This phone has many issues wouldn't suggest buying. Works part of the time shuts off all the time.	0
"this phone has nice features, but it&apos;s not good quality, i mean you can do many stuff like original iphone, and it&apos;s not functioning good, it just has camera like others, the GPS is just name also not working in here USA Chicago, so lets say it isn&apos;t functional phone or active."	0

EVERYTHING works and locks will be reset and any passwords will be given along with the phone. there is nothing wrong with this device i just liked my s5 better. the other reviews are not for this phone this is my first time selling anything! and i would not sell it if i thought it was damaged. "	1
This phone has one major problem that makes you have to reboot the phone  Too much. The screem will turn black in the middle  While you are using it and the only way to correct it is to reboot the phone. The phone dose not receive a good strong signal and keep it from the network. Also the storage place in the phone is very limited. All other operation of the phone is good.	0
"this phone has poor service, i cant hear very good out of the phone  so i put it in the desk to rott"	0
"This phone has severe crosstalk from the RF output into the microphone audio. In layman&apos;s terms, everyone you talk to will complain about buzzing sounds and those annoying cellular chirps and beeps. Spend more money and get a better quality phone."	0
This phone has so many software issues it is unbelievable. It has the shortest battery life and won't stop crashing. Thought it may of just been mine so I bought another one. And they both had the same issues.  	0
This phone has the Android 4.1.2 and now all my apps are telling me I need  androind 5.0 or higher to access the site to pay my bills ! So far consumers power and last night wells Fargo.. Just great.. What's the point in having a smart phone if it's not smart .enough to update to 5.0?? So mine will be for sale soon on eBay. Now I have to braak out the laptop to pay my bills.. May as well go back to a flip phone.. I mean what's the point.. But loved this phone for the year I've had it..	0
"This phone has too many glitches for the price paid for it. It has restarted right in the middle of me using it for no apparent reason. Then when it starts again internet connectivity is lost and you have to power it off, remove the battery, power it on and hope connectivity is restored. No matter if I am using downloaded apps or pre-installed apps this problem occurs. Just today something showed up, the display timeout is set to 2 minutes and stayed on for 20 minutes before I manually turned off the display. Did mention that will also shut off when I am not even using it?"	0
"This phone has worked great since I've purchased it. Does everything my iphone did, plus it costs 1/3. Cant beat it,"	1
This phone have screen cracked and seller didnt Manson it Im not happy with that 	0
"This phone I had replaced 3 times... I&apos;m very careful with phones but the touchscreen never worked and eventually I just gave up on UT Starcom, I will never buy a phone from them again."	0
This phone in particular had unsatisfactory dictation ability and poor battery life	0
This phone is ... Perfect	1
"This phone is 4 Years old, yet it still does everything I could want in a phone. Granted it isn&apos;t up to speed with the latest Droid and iphones, but it still is pretty good compared to its age."	1
This phone is a 2 year old model that Firefly doesn&apos;t even sell anymore.  It is only useable if you purchase another sim card for $9.99.  It is not the easiest to program due to not having any numbers. So much for the advertised free 30 minutes of free air time - you don&apos;t get that!!!	0
"This phone is a classic. As an unlock phone, it still works very well on the existing at&amp;t service.  It&apos;s durable, very basic and perfect for a backup phone. I&apos;m sure many of us has bought a higher tech phone with all these features that end up breaking down like my motorola v505. The v60, no matter how long you keep it for, it seems to never break down and is very dependable."	1
"this phone is a disappointment. Bought it in December and its already not working. It&apos;s crap. When u try to use it or dial a number to place a call, it rings once then a recording comes on. No calls are received, screen resolution looks primitive."	0
"This phone is a good phone and it does everything i want it to do.There is nothing i dont like about this phone.Ive had other phones and there very simular but this phone is stronger so if you drop it,it wont smash."	1
This phone is a great alternative to a flip phone as the querty keyboard makes it easier and faster to text.    It is also a pretty good mp3 player.    Excellent phone for the price!	1
This phone is a great phone for those who enjoy watching videos on a big screen and check their social accounts. what's even better is the price tag. I would recommend this phone to anyone who's looking for a sleek and affordable phone.	1
"This phone is a great value for the price. It looks good, responds well, battery life is phenomenal.  I really like this phone."	1
This phone is a joke.  Mine has been replaced 3x&apos;s under warranty.  Touch screen starts to fail and you can&apos;t even make a call.  I can&apos;t even begin to tell you all the issues this phone has with apps/down loading etc.  I&apos;m warning you ....don&apos;t do it!	0
This phone is a one of a kind.  It has everything someone would want in a phone.  Its the type of phone anyone would like.	1
this phone is a piece of crap had to send it back twice and if it has to be sent back again im a have them send my money back...	0
THIS PHONE IS A PIECE OF CRAP. THE PHONE CRACKS DURING CALLS;WILL NOT ALLOW MMS MESSAGING;WILL NOT ALLOW INTERNET ACCESS. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PHONE.	0
"This phone is a piece of junk, I cant navigate messages correctly, The Signal never works inside buildings.  I cant send text messages right, there is any mp3 or install sd cards.  No QWERTY keyboard etc.  I threw it in the trashcan.  I got something with a qwerty keyboard that actually works now and am much happier.  I can actually get signal some times in buildings now."	0
"This phone is a pile of junk.  Screech's, and can't be understood. Don't waste your money!"	0
This phone is a straight forward device and easy to handle and navigate.  I am enjoying the features and ability to customize as desired!	1
"This phone is a waste of time and money. Battery lasts for about four hours stand-by time. To use it i will have to keep it plagued in to power supply all the time. This phone is not a DREAM G2 is a NIGHTMARE G2, it&apos;s totally useless.  Don&apos;t waste your money."	0
"This phone is ABSOLUTELY AWESOME ...if you live in Canada, Great Britain, or China.  Bums sold it to me knowing I live in the US... I don't know, maybe they didn't know it doesn't have the right frequency. Otherwise, the phone rules. I'm writing this review on it right now!  It's lightning fast, has two Sim card slots, expandable memory... It's nice and BIG!....... Yet still, I refuse to give it up. I use it with WiFi."	0
"This phone is absolutely useless, it can&apos;t be used at all because it doesn&apos;t have a place for a SIM card.  And can NOT be programmed for use."	0
"This phone is advertised as Alltel and it is not. Alltel is going to charge us to &quot;unlock&quot; it and the guy said he would take it back and refund money...except $15 shipping. It is not worth it to send it back. I don&apos;t know what I will do with it.     As a general rule, I love Ebay."	0
This phone is advertised UNLOCKED and it is NOT . It's also a Claro network phone that cannot be unlocked . Here is the URL that gives that info and the reason why . I have contacted the seller with proof the phone is Locked with a screen shot showing the Network lock status . They will NOT acknowledge the truth I provided . So far I've spent money two times to get codes to unlock this phone . It cannot be unlocked . Now you know why the price is so low . BEWARE  	0
"This phone is amazing even it is not a flagship device. Specs inside are very good, runs really smooth and even though it has a huawei UI over the android OS, it does a pretty good job. It has many useful apps that come with the huawei UI. Camera does a good job and the front camera is one of the main features. Battery life as in any smartphone will not last for several days but i end up with 30% and i use this phone from 7am through 10 or 11pm, so very impressed with the battery life. The design its very sleek and outstanding, you can feel the quality of the materials choice when holding it. Only problem i encountered was that i am not able to find a huge selection of cases as in other devices."	1
This phone is amazing smooth and awesome speakers 	1
"This phone is amazing! Beautiful display, very good sound quality and excelent camera. Not to mention that it is smart and it looks good. 4 days average battery without abusing the hands free feature or the camera&apos;s xenon flash feature. All in one is a great mobile phone for it&apos;s price and category level.  I have to mention that all the above are only my opinions and for only my mobile phone. If you happen to have other thoughts about this phone please let us know."	1
"This phone is amazing, takes great photos!!! It might not have the most updated firmware of android, but its still wonderful!!! Just to let you know, it has the 1.5 firmware and after doing research about updating it to 1.6, i would suggest not to get the update, alot of bugs, T-Mobile pulled the update because of all the complaints they received from owners of this phone. If you have to have the latest &quot;IT&quot; phone then buy another phone, but this phone does it all and more. I can send text messages and MMS messages and record a small clip to send with the photo! I can download tons of apps from the droid market, surf the net, check email and the phone calls sound great on both ends. People who do not have a data plan will not enjoy this phone too much, I have an unlimited data plan and have no problems with this phone."	1
This phone is amazing. Ive had a lot of phones including other Blu phones but this one beats them all. Android is better than IOS. Google play has different apps than Apple that are better apps. The Blu phone is the perfect size. It works fast and the sound is totally awesome. Way better than Samsung.	1
This phone is an amazing phone for kids 10 and up! I bought this for my daughter and it still works perfectly! The camera is great and there are zero glitches whatsoever. Amzing phone	1
This phone is available directly from OnePlus for nearly $100 less with full factory warranty	0
this phone is awesome in so many ways.  LG makes a great product that can withstand just about anything you throw at it.  i decided to get this phone because i am replacing the exsisting one that i have.	1

"This phone is awesome, The marketplace is kinda small but its quickly growing. Its like having a windows computer in your pocket."	1
This phone is awesome. I&apos;m SO impressed with it&apos;s style and looks. The phone is way more advanced and has so many more options than my blackberry curve did. I love it because now I don&apos;t butt dial people (:	1

This phone is awful. No memory of any sort. Battery life is horrible. You wouldn't want this phone even if it was free. Idk if it cause it's REFURBISHED. But not good at all. 	0
"This phone is bad: the microphone does not pickup the sound, you have to shout load and the person on the other end can barely hear you.  The seller claimed it was new.  But what I know about Sony products and quality, he was not telling the truth.  Sony would have been long out of business making such low quality products."	0
This phone is being  sold over and over by this seller be careful. 	0
This phone is big but still better than other big phone. The speed is amazing and the picture quaility is fantastic. Its almost like you wen and bought a $1500 Cameron camera but better. 	1
This phone is broken Has a shattered screen Dead screen spots It is 64GB not 256GB 	0
"This phone is built tough. Easy to use. Speaker phone, internet ,downloads, video, pictures. All in a small compact phone. I like the flip verses the touch tone. The buttons aren&apos;t as easy to accidently push verses a touch tone. I am tired of hanging up on everybody when my cheek touches the buttons on a touch screen. Well this is my answer. I can hear loud and clear, long battery life. Perfect for me. :) hope this helps"	1
This phone is compact and easy to maneuver.  I like it as it has microsoft operating system and is compatible with my email and computer information.  Great for anyone professional and it&apos;s size makes it even more desirable.	1
This phone is cool. All features and battery life is perfect. I have used a 9780 for 3years and don&apos;t think I&apos;ll change to any other phone anytime soon.	1
"This phone is crap. Only had it a month and it's already crashing. It cuts off in the middle of a call. The screen will go black, so I have to take the battery out just to restart it. I do not recommend this phone. Want my money back"	0

This phone is everything the reviews said it was.  The camera is amazing and the AI features are all very cool.	1
"This phone is exactly what I needed. My old version was pretty beat up, and this black and orange one works perfectly and looks great.  It was easy to switch the sim card and battery."	1
This phone is exactly what I was looking for. The seller dispatched it to me and was helpful throughout to ensure I got the phone. It is a lot thinner than I thought it was and is beautiful. The battery life is impressive and interesting how they have done the power saving mode. It does take a bit of getting used to but the phone is helpful in setting up and explaining everything to you.  I would recommend this phone from this seller to anyone that wants the dual use and e-reader type screen on the back. 	1
"This phone is exactly what was advertised, it is a great buy!"	1
This phone is excellent value and has a number of features that are found on more expensive phones. I need to learn how to use most of them.	1
"This phone is excellent, I going to buy others. The price is very good. Excellent seller.I bought this phone for a gift, it has MP#, TV, and radio."	1
This phone is excellent...for phone and text only. The browser does not work period. Not even for t mobile.	0
This phone is fabulous a must have has everything that I want &amp; need and more because I have had several phones but this one I have to say beats all the rest.	1
This phone is fantastic and it's one you should get.	1

"This phone is for my wife.  She already has one but it is so old I thought it would be a good idea to have a back up if she looses hers.  All Motorola phones are really good.  This one in light weight,easy to use and has all the function any one would need.  My son talked me into an iphone or I would be using a Krazer also."	1
"This phone is for those who want the power of a blackberry but arent really caught up to the corporate, email, browsers experience. Its a blackberry for those who want a blackberry and love music...for a younger crowd!!"	1
"This phone is garbage.  It was a waste of money.  The functions are terrible.  The screen freezes, and its so thick, you can use it as a weapon.  I wouldnt recommend this phone to my worst enemy."	0
"This phone is gonna last a long time I believe. It is great for calling, texting and email, which is all I need in a phone. The only areas I dont like is that the flap for covering the charger port is flimsily attached, and even when it is stored loosely in a side pocket it wants to dial random numbers. It takes great pics, videos and call clarity is excellent. Well worth the price."	1
"this phone is good quality, and just the right size"	1
This phone is great and has all the features like videos and great for text messaging.  I am very glad i bought this phone its one of the best phones for virgin mobile.	1
This phone is great for its price has nice specs but it was missing the sim injector tool but everything else is fine. I don't know if it's only with my phone but it takes forever to charge but the charger says it's a fast charger. 	0

"this phone is great the shipping was fantastic, it took no time, everything worked???"	1
This phone is great!  It works well with my service with no problems right from the beginning.  The battery life and ease of usage has been the best phone I've had.  	1
"This phone is great! This is second one I&apos;ve used, I love the physical keyboard and how it&apos;s so lightweight. This is a pretty good starter phone, its cheap but it lasts pretty long. The downside is that there isn&apos;t enough memory so I have to constantly delete my text messages, but my phone takes care of that for me through the messaging settings :)"	1
"This phone is great, battery life, over all usage, and it is water proof. I love this and would recommend this phone to anyone"	1

"This phone is great.  Different than all others, one of a kind.  You can speak when open or close and it has the neatest sounds, tones, and graphics."	1
"This phone is great.  It is durable and has extremely clear reception. I love this phone. I purchased this phone for my son, but instead I started to use it.  It is much smaller than a flip top.  I think it is a great value for the price."	1
"This phone is great. Even though meant consider it old with the s8 out,  it really exceeds what you can ask for. With prices on it going down,  it's probably the best deal on am elite phone you'll find. "	1
This phone is great. It beats the iphone 4s in every single way besides battery life but even then i would just download the battery saver app and i&apos;m good to go. Built quality is amazing.	1
"This phone is great. My husband had one and no matter how many times he dropped it and ruined it, the phone worked perfectly. I had one as well that worked great and never gave any kind of problems."	1
"This phone is horrendous !!! Stay away !!! It would regularly lock up. When you flipped the qwerty open, the screen would not shift. Way too many glitches to list. Awful Awful !!"	0
"This phone is horrible.  I wish I didn't spend the kind of money I did to get it.  The phone constantly hangs up on people and calls others I didn't want to call.  The slide keyboard is hard to type on and the ""h"" is so hard to push, I find many messages that are missing all of the ""h's"".  I do not recommend this phone to anyone.  Spend the extra money to get a better phone.  "	0
"This phone is ideal and is a joy to have. used it in Belize Central America while on vacation.This was my first time using a smart phone in that region, but to my surprise it worked like a champion. Before I came home a friend convinced me to me to leave it for me as gift. I did bless him with the phone and must now by another before I prepare for another vacation.One thing I can promise you is that I will never give anther review if you are asking for one hundred characters. I like the phone but I don&apos;t see why I should spend valuable time sharing my experience with the community. I should be able to give you a sentence or two, but what you are asking for is too much for someone like me that is always on the run"	1
"This phone is in excellent working order except for one small problem. When I'm talking the screen stays active and my face/ear/chin accidentally touches a button and performs an action. It's annoying, but I don't talk on the phone much as everything is text or email or other functions that do not require my face touching the screen.   The processor is fast. the battery life is excellent. Very happy."	1
"This phone is junk has compatible issues with app downloads. Phone gets hot when charging, along with battery."	0
"This phone is junk, locked up and won&apos;t come on even though it has a full battery. The phone was suppose to be unlocked but it isn&apos;t. Don&apos;t bother if your T-Mobile cause it won&apos;t work."	0
This phone is just another example of the fantastic quality of the entire Mytouch series. They come in many different styles and colors all the way from a white Mytouch 3g original to the new LG Mytouch Q in black! They have so many easy to use fun features that this phone could fit anyone from a child to a business man. 5 stars for sure and a good gift for anyone!	1
This phone is just what I ordered for my daughter for Christmas.  I know that she is going to love it.  Thanks so much!!!	1
This phone is leap and bound above my s7. It's faster and has much better battery life. 	1
THIS PHONE IS LISTED AS STOLEN.  CANNOT ACTIVATE IT AT ALL.   REQUESTING MY 130.00 RETURNED AND YOU CAN HAVE THIS JUNK PHONE.   THIS US HORRIBLE	0
This phone is locked do not buy it.	0
This phone is lost and stolen bad seller and lier do not purchase from this seller !!	0
"This phone is more then I will ever need, I&apos;ve had it for several months and haven&apos;t gotten close to knowing all of it&apos;s features."	1
"This phone is necessary to have if you like to multi task! It has seven windows you can operate on and allows you to keep up with all featured social networks on the phone. Its super easy to add in email accounts and quick office is a plus in case if my on the go with my little newborn! I brought this phone mainly for those reasons but the primary one was for the wifi calling feature it has especially since I don&apos;t get much service in my area since T-Mobile has yet to add a tower; I am glad I brought it!    My likes about this phone is the touch screen and having a keyboard that way I am not always getting annoyed with my fingers doing something unwanted. I also like that during a call the screen lights up for other options only when you pull the phone away from you to avoid misplaced calls.    Dislikes is that this phone is defintely like a mini-computer and should be treated as such by shutting down to eliminate sporadic frozen screens. The phone comes with two batteries and two battery backs. Although the smaller battery doesn&apos;t stay charged enough for me I find my self using the extended battery more. I wish I could find a nice case for when I am using the extended battery and battery door.    Otherwise, my previous phone had water damage and paying for a new $300 phone was a bit ridiculous. I would highly  recommend to a friend."	1
"This phone is nice looking , however mine has several problems with it. The #7 had to be pushed really hard to dial numbers. Then the battery went. Replaced battery but power doesn&apos;t come on. I had to buy a new different phone."	0
This phone is no good. It cannot send or recieve picture messages. What is the point of having a camera?	0
"This phone is no longer sold through Verizon, but my Daughter really one, so I was very happy to find it on eBay! The seller shipped it fast and the price was decent:)"	1
This phone is NO LONGER SUPPORTED by VERIZON or ANYONE ELSE.  WILL NOT ACTIVATE!!!	0
"This phone is not a good one. I got it in a box that seems to be new but the phone has a very poor signal reception. At my home and my office, I have full bars on the signal on my old phone (ZTE Zmax Pro) but when I put the sim card into the new phone, I barely got a single bar of signal. I could not make any call. Then I took it to my office where I have excellent signal with my old phone but got no bar at all on this Samsung Galaxy Note 5. I then logged onto the WIFI network trying to make a WIFI call and the damn AT&T features on this phone would not let me make a WIFI call without an AT&T account. My service is with T-Mobile and I thought this phone was for T-Mobile. So, I'm returning it and get my money back. I will never buy another Samsung phone through eBay. "	0
"This phone is not a very good phone, but it&apos;s a blessing. It doesn&apos;t hang up when I call people, so it could run up your daytime minutes.  I have to charge it at least once a day, and there are few options.  I&apos;ve had Samsung phones before with another company, and they were SO much better than this one.  I&apos;m taking it back to the store!"	0
This phone is not compatible with the major GSM 4G networks in the U.S. I bought the phone last year and just got Edge on T-mobile network and H on AT&T's.  Don't buy this phone if you are in the U.S. and want to use 4G data.	0
This phone is not in working order. In order to do anything you have to keep it on charger and this just won&apos;t work! Bad dealing here!	0
"This phone is NOT NEW, it is REFURBISHED!"	0
"This phone is not the Samsung Galaxy J7 (2016). The phone I received was a Samsung Galaxy J7 (2015). There are major differences and Best Buy is advertising the wrong phone for sale and got me good. I bought two, one was shipped to me and I chose to pick up the other at my local best buy. They had to cancel my order because they couldn't process the transaction...but they took my money and HAVE NOT refunded it yet! Beware of Best_Buy eBay. They falsely advertised the phone and are not failing to refund my money for my second purchase THEY CANCELED on their own."	0
This phone is not unlocked to work with other operators as the title says.  This cell phone has no sim card slot.  the saleswoman tried to cheat me    I charged her with the truth in front!	0
This phone is not very user friendly. Too many steps to do basic things. Battery is terrible but could be acceptable if the phone didn&apos;t freeze up so much. I used it for a day and then i was done!	0
"This phone is not working anymore...reported stolen,is on black list.....so i need u guys to help me out soon!!"	0
This phone is not worldwide compatible. You MUST have a Verizon sim card to make it work. Do not purchase from this seller. They will accept the phone back but not return your money! Do not purchase from this seller!!!!!!	0
This phone is not worth the money. The seller sells the phone with no SIM card and the SIM card is impossible to get your hands on but they make it sound like it is no big deal. With out the SIM card you get no 4G among other problems. On top of everything the functionality of the phone kind of stinks and is annoying to use.	0
This phone is ok so far.  But a couple of days before I bought this phone via ebay I also bought a Slvr L6 Motorola and I bought the warranty ebay offered me by square trade. 2 days ago the screen on it went black the keypad is the only thing that lights up. I tried using my warranty from squaretrade and they said its not covered becuase the phone is a forieghn phone from china not a USA phone. So basically I got riped off by EBAY!! So once the Motorola T722i breaks down which is also probably a china made phone I am screwed even if I bought the warranty. So I dont think ill be buying anything from EBAY anymore. Thanks for nothing!!!!!	0
"This phone is one of the best I've ever had.  The large 5.5"" screen helps make viewing very easy!"	1
This phone is one of the best phones i have ever had. I love it. Its not to heavy and it has everything you need.	1
"This phone is our second phone just like this.  The first one broke about a year after we got it.  It was new when purchased and was very well taken care of.  This phone was also well taken care of but broke only 3 months after purchase.  I have heard of other people also having problems with their Kyocera phones.  I will NEVER, NEVER, NEVER, EVER buy another phone from Kyocera!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"	0
This phone is packed with both fun and serious features. It is a relatively small phone compared to other phones with QWERTY keyboard.  The 2MP camera takes good pictures and the memory is expandable. I would definitely recommend this to people who like a to have a user-friendly phone on the go.	1
This phone is perfect for me for several reasons:    - Light and compact  - Both CDMA and GSM capable  - Great battery life  - No data plan required with Verizon   and   - Great Price!	1
This phone is perfect!!! has all the features of a real live blackberry for a boost mobile price. The screen is a little small but I hate touch screen phones.  video and pics look great. The keyboard is easy to see and use. I would highly recommend this phone to all who are looking for the blackberry experience with a prepaid price.	1
"This phone is pf good quality, and considering its price, it is great value. "	1
"This phone is poorly designed.  I bought this one thinking I had a flaw with the one I had owned before.  When I received this one, it was cracked in the same place as my old one.  I sent it back and would never by another one like this."	0
This phone is previously used and I understand it wont work like new I&apos;ve bought used phones before and they work remarkably well some like new this phone freezes to much and drains the battery too fast I find myself charging it more than I use it and then I have to keep opening the back to take out the battery to shut it off and turn back on cause of freezing the valume sounds very low at its loudest when you use the loud speaker not at all what I read from the previous owner when I bought the phone highly upset and planning on buying an other phone this time galaxy 3 and hoping never to deal with this phone again hope my review helps people think before buying from this seller oh yes not writing the review cause Im mad cause like I said I bought used phones on ebay before just a month ago I bought an htc for my hubby and it works well and last year a phone for my daughter and that works well and so to end I gave a 2 1/2 stars cause the phone hasnt fully died yet and the features are great	0
This phone is really easy to use and the best thing about it is it has wireless charging.	1
"This phone is reasonably priced compared to other phones with many extra features that are convenient. It has a camera, comes with a cover,is easy to use, and it is nice and slim. One thing I do not like is actually the cover which has a huge clip on it. It makes the phone seem big when it is not. Also, the plastic that covers the viewing windows sticks to the phone and makes it hard to see the numbers.    One other thing is that there are not that many ring tones that I really like in the standard phone tones."	1
"This phone is several years old and still being an iPhone killer.    Its specs are below average this days (2011) but it performs very well, with little money you can find one of these here on ebay, you can&apos;t go wrong.    I was looking for an iPhone for parts or repair, but thankfully I did my research and ended buying one HERMES in great full working condition.    I cannot be dissapointed with my purchase."	1
"This phone is sleek, has great features, good picture quality large screen and I love it!  Accessories (cases) were easy to find with a lot of variety unlike other phones I've purchased. You can't go wrong with this Moto!"	1
This phone is small and very user friendly. Reception is clear and it is very easy to send text messages. If you are looking for a good basic phone this is it.	1
This phone is so bad I buy 1 day the phone is broke I don't know why I sent back the phone I don't like it it's no good people on the phone Define coming and if only one day is block that's so sad	0
This phone is so easy to use. I enjoy the light weight and slim design. This phone is exactly what I was looking for.	1
"This phone is so old it's not compatible with current versions of Android, and is not compatible with many apps in the Google play store. "	0
"This phone is so old that I have to turn my own light on; I have to use the side scroll part to move through the options.  Sometimes, when it gets tired, with a full battery, it will shut itself down for like 5 minutes; no matter what I&apos;m doing.  I DISLIKE this phone."	0
"This phone is so sleek and LG never fails to produce a sturdy and reliable phone. I was just looking for an upgrade and when the Chocolate became a clam shell, I just had to have it!"	1
This phone is so unique and has all the features a person need where a smart is concerned. i had the optimus g pro before i purchased this phone and so far i can give it 10/10 until i get my hands on the G3	1
This phone is stolen    Be careful whit this person.  Very bad person.    	0
this phone is stolen!!!	0
"This phone is sturdy, user friendly, and holds a charge well.  The buttons on the side don&apos;t seem to get pressed accidently as much as other phones I&apos;ve had and the picture quality is OK for it&apos;s size.  It withstands drops better than many (I&apos;ve had this model nearly 2 yrs).    It doesn&apos;t seem possible to record a sound and set it as a ringetone.  Of course, you can purchase sounds and songs as ringtones, but no real personalizing a ringtone is possible.   I didn&apos;t want a phone requiring an additional charge per month for internet availability.  Also, too many friends make accidental calls w non-flip or non-slider phones, so my choices became limited.  Fortunately, this is a good phone which fit the requirements."	1
This phone is superb	1
This phone is terrible! It locks up all the time and had terrible glitches nonstop! it don&apos;t even vibrate when you receive an incomming call &amp; you cannot text half of the time!!!!	0
This phone is terrible. You can't even type on it. You can't do anything on the screen because it jumps bad.	0
"This phone is the best phone I have had thus far.  I used to have to carry my Ipod and my cellphone but this phone is like the baby of them both. (an Ipod and cellphone in one)  The MP3 player is very loud, battery has a long life (especially with the amount of features on it).  You can program your phone to block numbers that are not on your call list and I can still send and receive text messages while I am roaming.   I highly recommend this phone."	1
"This phone is the best. Its compact, crystal clear screens, easy to use, and very durable. And trust me, I am really hard on a cell phone. I have dropped mine, kicked it, ran over it, and nothing will break this phone. I even soaked it water, and the only part that messed up was the screens, I can still call, and receive calls. Sweet phone!!!"	1
"this phone is the last best thing that nextel has come out with, I also had one before and wanna keep having the same phone."	1
"This phone is the ultimate productivity machine. Highly secure, fingerprint sensor encrypted by default. Very fast and with a better screen than an iPhone or Pixel. All day battery life and quick charge. Has SD card port and a type c port.   This is the perfect phone for the professional, who wants a fast, secure and productive powerhouse, with the graphics of the best and more expensive phones. All at a much lower price. "	1
"This phone is too old to be selling, alltel wont activate this phone! Would not buy from this buyer again!"	0
This phone is trash worth nothing to spend someone hard working dollar on that piece of trash. This phone doen&apos;t deserve my rating stars...	0
this Phone is used and its under Verizon mobile and it is locked by Verizon I can not use the phone  	0
This phone is useless since Verizon no longer activates 3G service. The description for the phone shows 4G but I was sent a 3G phone. The company isn't willing to make it right so I won't be ordering from them again...	0
This phone is very cheap. It does not get good reception at all. Very hard to hear and most of the time it does not even ring.	0
"This phone is very durable--I have dropped it, gotten it wet still works great"	1
"This phone is very easy to use, the battery life is awesome. Unfortunately it does not have WiFi connectivity."	1
This phone is very good. It had minimum cosmetic damage and it works better than the one i brought a year ago brand new.	1
This phone is very much worth the money. The condition of the phone is flawless. Highly recommend this phone.	1
"This phone is very nice,and for a phone without a flash on the camera it takes really clear pics.  BBM is awesome I prefere a Blackberry over a android."	1
This phone is very poor knock off.  Said standby more the 280 hours lasted 8 and was dead.  Talk was about 35 minutes then dead.  Vendor was good and took it back.  Don&apos;t buy the phone.	0
"This phone is very practical, the battery life is great it last about 48 hours without being charged. The features are very up to date, I had a 4g android phone prior to this one, and the battery lasted no more than 5 hours a day. This phone is small and very reliable, the camera resolution is great and I wouldnt change it for the world. I strongly recommend it."	1
This phone is very slow..and hard to text on. Would not buy again. its dirty and scratched up.......	0
"This phone is warming very much in daily using (facebook, youtube, chrome, whatsapp). I dont play games on this phone. If i want to took picture with flash the phone got stuck and i need to remove the battety for restart it.  Battery is very low quality. Not enough for the day with low contrast screen."	0
This phone is will not work if you are a Verizon customer.  No way to send it back.  I have been trying to figure out how to send it back and get my money back.  Not documentation come in the package.	0
"This phone is Wonderfull feature allows you to play music and ringtones through the phone&apos;s speakers, wifi, and I must say, for such a small phone it certainly puts out a great amount of sound and everything."	1
This phone is working well for my husband. A bit of a learning curve as he upgraded significantly but used the Samsung App to transfer information and also helped. Recommend highly.	1
This phone isn't good it turns off by itself it cannot can turn back on needed to return it to get back my money ASAP so i can get my son another good phone	0
This phone keeps crashing and I have to open apps three or more times to get to use them and after a few minutes it crashes again. I restore back to factory state and keeps doing it even with no third party apps only stock apps. Even settings app crashes. It a nice door stopper though.	0
this phone lasted maybe 30 days then showed hardware issues. would randomly black screen or shut off and not turn on. sony refused to repair because item imei was not from us or Canada. not happy with sony or the purchase of this item. 	0
this phone look nice but if you have another provider than AT&amp;T it will give you very limited features.the phone weight is really heavy.i didn&apos;t accept my 1 GB micro SD card.the battery life is very poor i only stays about 8 hours standby (without using the phone).  i had to return it and loose the shipping fee.	0
"This phone looking like S7, NOT S7 EDGE. Also on the box,it it written Samsung S7 only. But seller says it is S7 EDGE.. Which information is correct, I cannot depend of this item to buy.     "	0
This phone looks good and all but does not work worth a dime and it does not hold Network signal long enough to use data or make a calls. Just terrible!	0
"This phone looks news, and is very intuitive. I have nothing but praise for the seller, who provided me a basically spotless phone, Samsung ,the maker, and Sprint, who set it up for me with great customer service"	1
This phone may be small which is kind of perfect it fits in your pocket just right it's not bulky. It also has good picture quality takes really good pictures. The one I got literally has no flaws not next no scratches on the screen no nothing it's actually a good phone. I might be an adult and most people think they are for teenagers but this phone is good for me because I don't do a lot on phones I just talk text and take pictures so I don't need a great big fancy expensive phone when this one does the exact same. So it has good quality on taking. Fits perfect in your pocket and it's also pink my favorite color so I love the phone whether it's small or not. People pay top dollar for these Galaxy S7 and iPhone 6 and successes just because they're new and bigger and everything but they do the same thing as this phone does if not better. So if anyone wants to buy a phone that is small and fits your pocket and is not too big and does just about anything inexpensive phone would I highly recommend this phone. I love it. They also shipped it very fast and when they say 9 out of 10 they should say 10 out of 10 because mine had nothing at all wrong with it. It came in mint condition. So I highly recommend this phone if you're wanting a small phone that fits your pocket and yet still doe	1
"This phone meets my needs very well. I like the Android OS, and my tech needs are quite simple. This phone does far more than my typical needs require."	1
"This phone never worked at all.  They promised to replace it if I showed proof of return shipping.  I  have waited several months and still no replacement, only excuses.   Do not buy from them."	0
"This phone never works. I send to my mother,she can&apos;t use it. I try here in USA,the same problem.I just lost my money"	0
this phone not work in israel  seller is say me that work   but not work                           dont happy	0
This phone operates on android and  was unlocked so it could be connected as I wanted.  It also has decent battery life.	1
"This phone poorly functions. The speaker and ear piece don't work well and frequently lose sound.  The earpiece doesn't function at all, and using headphones is in and out. Takes good pictures and has a large screen which is nice, but the poor function make this a non-starter. "	0
"This phone provides a solid platform in a galaxy S family, not labeled a such but it is just like a galaxy s4 with windows, very responsive and the screen has great colors and contrast"	1
"This phone replace one like it that was lost.  My 10 year old is happy again, games galore, and oh she loves the flashlight feature on the phone.  She works one game on the phone, while doing another on the computer.  She loves it.  My son and I have the same type of phone each, and we are connected with a calling plan,  This is my first ""smart"" phone, and I don't find it intimidating for me.  There are may features that I probably am not using, but I am sure my 12 year old son is using them all, as he is forever on the phone."	1
This phone replaced the same phone that we already had.  We find that this phone has all the features that we need.	1
"This phone rocks, the camera, the screen, the speaker, wi-fi, gps, the reception are the best, the song that you download you can make it as a ring tone you dont have to buy a ring tone anymore. This phone can do almost everything compare to other phone on the market right now. The only little thing that i dont like is the battery capacity and you have to pay  some upgrades of the software. The gps is great if you like to travel a lot like europe and asia you can purchase it. Right now this is best phone i ever had."	1
"This phone satisfies my needs: texting, simple searching on the internet, make/receive calls, receive voice mail... - without the expense of a Iphone.  My first Pantech Breeze II lasted until it started to come apart (and still was working).  So I found the same phone on Ebay and I&apos;m very happy with my purchase.      Without going into a store, I exchanged the SIM cards, transferred my contacts, and no worries about another 2 year contract."	1
"This phone seemed quite difficult to use, not user friendly as many of the other reviews let on!   This particular phone did not function properly either."	0
This phone should be banned because of quality. It said needed new screen. I purchased a screen and still didn't work	0
This phone should not be in market at all. I highly do not recommend it to any body. Please do not buy this phone even for a penny. It turns off at least 5 times a day with me even when it was new. I took it to the nextel repair center and exchanged it for a new one in a box and still the phone would turn off on me all the time especially whle iam pressing the buttons to make a call or to review messages. Imagine waiting for a very important phone call and your phone turns off while its on your side or in your purse by iteself without you knowing that its off.	0
This phone shows no service after inserting into the SIM card. The signal disappears suddenly for unknown reasons. I tried to change the antenna but not working.	1
This phone sold by the seller doesnt have Proper description and his communication of mails doesnt have proper information either and he is very harsh towards buyers. I would never do business with him again	0
this phone still had someone&apos;s information still left on it and could not be removed so is of no use to me at all.	0
"This phone sucks in so many ways,that the only way I bought it was for the free Amazon Prime. Who ever was in charge of this phones development needs to be developed. This phone was like $650.00 new. And I purchased the phone for I think $119.99 or 129.99 with free Amazon prime. I don't know what that phone was good at. Give me a reason to buy another one, or something it does very well. This was a complicated  device to use. And what kind of operating system did it use? Overall the worst smartphone ever in my opinion.   "	0
this phone sucks! do NOT buy it.  camera is horrible and just everything about this phone is bad. it's a waste of money. 	0
"This phone sucks, couldn't use it at all. Lost my money"	0
"This phone sucks. I do not know why I bought this phone. It just sucks, I hate the OS, I hate the phone and I hate that I paid $80.00 for it. Please dont buy it and if you get one for free use it for a door stopper."	0
This phone sucks. The battery was shot. 	0
This phone that I bought got overheating and battery doesn&apos;t lasting good time. Even I bought double life battery and same problem.	0

THIS PHONE TURNS OUT TO BE ONE OF THE WORST PHONES EVER MADE BY MOTOROLA. IT&apos;S A PIECE OF JUNK AND THAT&apos;S ONE OF THE REASONS T-MOBILE DISCONTINUED IT SO SHORTLY AFTER IT CAME OUT....	0
"This phone wants to do randimsoftware updates everyday, sometimes skipping a few days, and when it does that it switches the time I'm on my phone which has cause me be late for work 3 different times. I almost got fired. I dont kniw why it does this but I just hit the no button now when it asks. It's very frustrating and the phone is also encrypted somehow now, which my kids could of accidentally done I can figure that out. Thank you Rat Pritchett"	0
This phone was a bad choice.  I feel that I was taken advantage of.  Seller would not help.  It may be unlocked but it is not in good shape. I am very disappointed...	0
This phone was a great buy and the shipping was really fast would definitly buy from seller again!Got the phone 4 days after buying it. It is great condition better then I expected for the price. Thank You	1
This phone was a great deal at a great price! I would recommend this product to anyone thats looking for  a good phone at a reasonable price.	1
"This phone was a great purchase! It was listed as in good condition, but is actually in nearly perfect condition - way nicer than expected and working great!    Thank you!"	1
This phone was a replacement for one I used for many years.  With updated software there are many 'new' features and looks that were very well done.  This mil-spec phone is like a brick and takes quite a beating and keeps on working.  I'll continue to use until not available any more.  Very satisfied!	1
This phone was a waste of money for anyone who ikes to txt alot the keys and touch screeen are good but it has no toggle and it is so frusterating to try and fix any mistakes you make while txting it would have been a much better phone if lg had just added that small feature and the battery life was just a bit better if you dont need this phone for txt i would highly recommend it if not find a different phone	0
"This phone was advertised as a Verizon phone and it is not. It's a AT&T phone. Also it was advertised as new, but it didn't come as new. It came in a box with no seals or plastic coverings. Very disappointing!"	0
"This phone was advertised as new and unlocked. It came in 2 weeks, looking spanking new in the box from overseas. After a considerable amount of trouble trying to get it activated and my number ported, it was discovered to actually be locked! Upon going to AT&T unlock portal, I get a message saying 'unable to unlock because account is delinquent'. I have no AT&T account in the first place and if I did, I always pay my bills. This was a true ripoff."	0
"This phone was advertised as s straight-talk phone but when I received it, I learned that it was a trac phone. Besides that the phone could not be activated due to ""it not being scanned properly when originally purchased"". Not sure exactly how that works but I do know the only way I would have been able to activate it was to obtain the original receipt and fax it to straight-talk. The seller of course was unable to produce the original receipt so I requested a refund. I was then told I would be charged a restocking fee. Luckily eBay stepped in and cleared all of this up, I still haven't received my refund yet but I'm expecting it soon."	0
This phone was as described! It was clean without scratches and so appealing to the eye.  I love it!	1
"This phone was bought and sent overseas for my younger brother, but the sim card holder is not good. Unfortunately I can get it back because of the cost"	0
"this phone was claimed as new, refurbished, however, it was old phone with only the top screen was changed to new one. the trouble is that the wifi was not working, and we thought it was new so that gave a gift to a guest, until 32 days found out the wifi was not working,  the seller claimed passed 30days, without any responsibility  it is sad"	0
"This phone was defective from the get-go.  It turned itself off periodically, without warning.  It would not hold contacts, call history, or texts that I transferred over from my old phone.  It would shut down in the middle of an app.  It was obviously defective and should never have been sold."	0
This phone was dysfunctional. It is was tested at all the seller would have know. Received it with about 10% battery. Charged to 100% and battery would last about 15 minutes before being completely dead. Next day the iPhone shut off randomly and would not turn back on. Really sucks having to return this phone and wait another few days to get another one. I expected the phone to actually work when paying almost $200. 	0
This phone was exactly as described. Super fast delivery 	1
"This phone was exactly what I wanted and at a lower price than Walmart and other websites. It was mailed in a timely manner and actually arrived sooner than I was expecting it. It was in the packaging and came with everything as advertised. I needed it because I'm downgrading from a Galaxy S5, but this phone isn't so bad. "	1
"This phone was for my boyfriend. He loves it! He previously had a Samsung which he did like, but he is in love with this phone. It was said to have been a display model in a mobile store. It had one tiny knick on the back which you could barely see. It works great and was at a great price. Never had an HTC before, but it has a lot of its own HTC features that are cool along with the regular android Microsoft features. Exactly as picture and description was spot on, they even had told me about the tiny knick before purchase.   "	1
This phone was for my son. Unfortunately he couldn&apos;t use it due to his phone plan. So I ended up just using it for a alarm	1
This phone was functional for all of about five minutes. The screen is damaged and does not respond to touch. It has also now stopped charging - it is a phone fault not a cable as I've tried at least seven cables in over a hundred power outlets.  Hugely regretting wasting my money on this product. Do yourself a favour and buy a legitimate phone from a store.  i was offered to return it for a refund but I've been moving around the states and Canada for the last two months and it was impractical for me to try and post it back. It went in the bin LONG ago. 	0
This phone was horrible it will not charge and I bought it for my sons birthday very disappointed and the seller was no help had to go through eBay for my money back	0
"This phone was in great cosmetic condition when received  But at no point in the description did it state that the phone would be BURNED BACKGROUND IMAGES ON THE SCREEN! I would be returning it, but I'd rather not go through the hassle!  "	0
This phone was in perfect condition when i got it. Not a thing wrong with it. Thank you so much!	1
"This phone was introduced in 2001 for $600 in some retail markets.  It is particularly sought after by European tekkies because it was made in Sweden. It is considered a &quot;world&quot; phone.  It operates on a tri-band frequency.  When unlocked, it accommodates Sim cards for service in most countries.  Features like SMS, WAP, GSRP, and Bluetooth compare to the technology of the newer models.  Two things to keep in mind after purchasing: It must be unlocked and the firmware should be updated.  Purchase a data cable to download your Outlook Express address book, et.al.  The phone is a workhorse for the frequent flyer.  It is not a flip phone, but it is lightweight and the battery is thin.  They appear on US eBay every once in a while.  Fifty bucks is a fair price, considering the phone&apos;s capabilities."	1
"This phone was just as described. It had very minimal scuffs on the outside, which don&apos;t impair its performance at all. I bought this one to replace my old razor. I know how to use the razor and tend to be hard on phones, so these new I-phones that you drop once and they break, just don&apos;t work for me. This razor works wonderfully!"	1
This phone was listed as a new unlocked phone. Upon receiving this phone it came with a power block which appeared to be something used in Germany not the United States. I went to activate the phone and it cannot be activated in the United States.	0
"This phone was marked as a new phone and it's NOT.  I have to send it back and buy another phone. Huge hassle being without a phone.  Sometimes it works, other times it powers off and won't power back on,  even with a full charge.  "	0
This phone was not a straight talk phone as advertised.  It is a Track phone and is of no use to the person I bought it for as a Christmas gift.  Very disappointed. 	0
THIS PHONE WAS NOT FULLY FLASHED. SELLER DID NOTHING TO HELP. I HAD TO PAY AN EXTRA $15 AT CRICKET TO GET IT FULLY FLASHED&gt;	0
THIS PHONE WAS NOT FULLY FLASHED. SELLER DID NOTHING TO HELP. I HAD TO PAY AN EXTRA $15 AT CRICKET TO GET IT FULLY FLASHED&gt;	0
This phone was not possible to make working with AT&T.  Its technical support could not understand what is wrong with the phone.	0
This phone was not unlocked and Verizon verified it's not unlocked 	0
"this phone was OK for a month. It takes OK pictures, no flash. I had many dropped calls and live in an area surrounded by verizon towers. Also, it only had SMS texting and no EMS. The reception was never very good. Then after a month, the front LCD screen just stopped working correctly. Now I am missing calls, messages and voicemails and am already in the market for a new phone."	0
This phone was poor in quality like a fake plastic toy phone. It didn't have any of my cell phone company apps available in the app store either. I wouldn't recommend this product.	0
"This phone was purchased as a Christmas gift and was set up on December 27, 2016.  However, after a week of usage, static can be heard.  In the past, Samsung Galaxy Prime have been good smartphones; maybe a defective phone was received."	0
This phone was purchased to replace a flip phone. The flip phone required the use of two hands to open and operate. The Samsung A777 has the ease of one-hand operation. The keyboard has larger buttons which are easier to depress with less chance of misdialing.	1
This phone was rated 9.5 out of 10 and I have to say it really is! The phone is as described and is perfect!! Thank you so much!!! My son is very happy!! 	1
This phone was reported stolen! ! Be on alert for stolen items. 	0
This phone was sent to me in a very filthy condition there was food in the flip of the phone it obviously digested food or vomit. I want my money back immediately. It is a health issue.	0
This phone was sold to me still locked on a account the seller has ignored to close. The phone was still on a virgin mobile account that was never closed.	0
This phone was stolen using my ebay account seller would not help even knowing it was stolen Never did recoup the money terrible 	0
"This phone was suppose to be unlocked , but it's locked to another carrier ...   Of course it's past the 30-day period so the seller is not trying to resolve the issue ...   "	0
"This phone was supposed to be unlocked for AT&T use, but it is not.   Only can call and text no mobile data.  Do not buy!"	0
This phone was the biggest piece of crap ever.  I opened it up abd literally snapped it in half if you are lookin for a phone to recycle then this is the phone for you	0
This phone was the worst phone i have ever gotten it had lots of problems it had dirt inside the screen i couldnt clean it! and it turned off by itself didnt have any signal the touch system is very slow and freezing all the time cant see my contacts sometimes i mean am i unlucky or this phone is so stupid everybody is being sarcastic?? it just got me really mad!	0
this phone was to be said to be in good condition and after receiving it first off the charger didn&apos;t charge it and then you could not access the web and after contacting my provider i was told the phone was defected then i took it to a sprint store and sure enough it was defected so by now it was too late to return it and guess what i was out of $22    Thanks for nothing	0
"This phone was warranted to be ""water resistant for up to one meter for 30 minutes"". Not true! The phone was accidentally dropped in a pool. It was in less than one meter of water for less than 10 seconds. Upon retrieving the phone and druing it thoroughly the screen failed to operate. The phone will turn on but the screen is dead. The phone was less than one week old. The supplier has failed to stand behind the phone as promised. Bad vendor:bad phone. The video about this phone shows it submerged in a glass of water for 30 minutes. This phone failed after 10 soconds"	0
"This phone was way better than I imagined.  They described the phone accurately, and I had no problems activating it or using it.  I am very pleased with this seller.  They had shipped promptly and I received the phone within 2-3 days of winnng auction."	1
"This phone WILL after placing your sim card in (because it is supposidly unlocked) direct you to vorizon for billing of any call you attempt to make as per my experience involving AT&amp;T sim cards on this phon. Just a heads up that this phone does not work as advertized and you will have to go through several channels to finnaly get your money back E.G Ebay,electronics 4 less, paypal...  Very inconvenient do not buy this phone."	0
This phone will not connect with any towers in my area after being told it would by the Tracfone rep. ( seller).	0
"This phone will not store contacts and numbers. it will not connect to my computer to transfer files, only charges, does not have an accessible  Mac address to register with WiFi"	0
this phone will not work with assurance wireless. they no longer accept this phone.	0
"This phone won my heart the second I saw it!!! It's so sophisticated, thiny, has a pretty good big screen and lots of features like recording your call which can be pretty useful!!! The phone is amazing, now my husband wants one like that. Although the brand is not so popular like Apple and Samsung, Blu keeps impressing me with the quality of their phones. I highly and strongly recommend this phone, and believe me I rarely write reviews. "	1
this phone work great when I first got it after the first month it would not power up not  even with the charger	0
This phone worked for a couple of weeks then went dead it also overheated when attempts was made to charge it. Attempts made to contact the seller has been futile as i emailed and did not get a response do not waste your money on this its a bad buy i repeat ITS A BAD BUY.	0
This phone worked on LTE immediately unlike the last two that I bought from other sellers. Freedompop has an excellent yearly plan with premium voice for only about 100.00 a year. Works great.	1
"This phone worked well out of the box but in real life, using it to its potential, facebook etc, it overheats in a scary way. Battery drains in a few hours. It is not really usable. sitting there sleeping, screen off, alarm clock running, no wifi, it may be usable, also for telephone calls but it is made to do much more, only, it cannot due to the overheating problem. "	0
This phone works but it's obvious this has been used hard. The phone has long lag periods and take forever to load content and find things. Same issues I had with my old note 4. I was hoping buying a different one would resolve these issues. It didn't.  A used phone is a used phone. ....old and crappy but just slightly better then the old one.....that is this product.  	0
"This phone works for T-Mobile and has only 3G network, I don't care cos it works perfectly. I bought the 6.44"" one, it sure is go big or go home. At $310, you will get every value for your money. Heads up, you will need to download play store for Google related apps. You might need to watch YouTube for directions but you will definitely be able to figure it out. Thank me later lol"	1
"This phone works great for Verizon.No contract,can upgrade to another phone at any time.Very rugged and durable."	1
"This phone works great, I have had this phone for 2 years and since sprint took out the second antenna on the galaxy s 4 and 5 (which will not allow you to be on internet and talking on phone at same time). I am staying with the galaxy 3 fo as long as I can."	1
"This phone works perfectly except for one major defect: no one can hear me. I can hear whoever I am talking to but the speaker is broken and the person on the other end cannot hear me. I don&apos;t know if I missed some fine print about this being a possibility, but it was disappointing, especially since I did not realize this until I got abroad. I have yet to check if the problem would be remedied with the use of a headset, which I&apos;m assuming it would be and I would have brought one with me had I known about this issue. Other than that, the phone was delivered promptly and has good battery life, etc."	0
This phone would be a lot nicer if I could actually use it. I&apos;m not please to find out that I bought it and can&apos;t use it because the previous owner didn&apos;t pay their bill or whatever.	0
"This phone would never charge, so it was not useable. I ended up buying a brand new phone which I was trying to avoid,"	0
This phone would not charge because there is something wrong with the charging connection or wiring.  This phone erased all my messages when I switched batteries.  This phone would not allow texting with singal letters as my old one did.  The functions were not working properly.  Thank you for wasting my money...I&apos;m pissed.	0
This phone would not register because it was stolen. Do not buy from seller. 	0
This phone&apos;s technology is not supported in this area. Please contact our Customer Care Center at 1-877-836-2368 for further assistance.So I am not able to use this.	0
"This phone, like Casio's previous model, is very durable. The phone is a used purchase, and looks and works as new. The previous model was in an ironworkers back pocket for five years. Aside from some edge abrasion to the finish, it is undamaged, after being dropped, bumped and banged numerous times. The new one is an upgrade, and operates quickly and with ease. It was purchased for the durability, the ease of navigation is a bonus. I would recommend this phone to anyone needing a phone that can take abuse and still work very nicely."	1
"This phone/computer is excellent. The screen quality is excellent, the connections speed is wonderful. I&apos;ve never owned anything like it. I give it 2 thumbs up."	1
This phones are cool and cheap but they last less than two months. I'm not happy with it. I don't recommend it 	0
"This phones keyboard sucks. You have to restart it constantly for the buttons to work. Blackberry has no apps. The service was crappy on Sprint service. I am sooooooo fed up with Blackberrys. I would not recommend it to anyone, and I recommend selling yours ASAP."	0
"This piece of junk came with the center of the touchscreen unresponsive to any touch. I can not do anything with it because I can&apos;t press anything in the center of the screen, like the number 5, or basically anything. My aunt took it overseas to give to a cousin, and brought it back to my attention the day she came back, and Daily Steals won&apos;t issue me a store credit or a refund. They are crooks."	0
this pnone dosent work!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and also i want my money back beacuse it dosent work...............!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! so i hope i can return this phone back to you because it dosent work and i cant connect it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	0

This product appears to be great! 	1
"This product came as described, It was in good shape. There was a little glitch with the charging cord. it was the wrong one. but after an email to seller i had the correct one in a couple of days. I would look up this seller again when needed."	1
This product came on time and was s described.   I love this phone.  It is affordable and competitive with newer models.	1
This product did not live up to expectation.  Would not buy again.  It malfunctioned almost immediately.  The screen was upside down and backwards.	0
"This product does not appear to have been an actual Samsung product, but a fake.  It was total junk which I tossed in the garbage 10 minutes after I received it."	0
This product exceeded my expectations for a budget this size	1
this product I really liked! price function corresponds to the design! recommend a good estimate of all!!!!	1
This product is a great buy! Easy to use cell phone with lots of features. Texting and emailing is easy on this phone.	1
"this product is all in Spanish and I do not speak that language, I speak English and so I would like to return it"" and am asking you to send me a return label as soon as possible to 413 Gassaway St. Hinesville GA.31313 I would like an exchange for another phone"" thank you "	0
This product is defective. 	0
"This product is good for a back up ONLY. It is super huge and thick--like a brick! I thought it would be smaller than it was when it came in the mail. It works, and that is what&apos;s important. I would only recommend this product if you need a cheap back up phone."	0
This product is great. I bought the white one for my mom and she loved it. It works good. Good value for the money. I would recommend it to others.	1
This product is no quality and no satisfaction 	0
"this product isn't  new and not have the wire charge , so really not is new "	0
"This product looks good, but it was locked by sprint and was unpaid by the seller. So it did not get activated on my number "	0
"This product only had 4 gigabytes of storage. it constantly shuts down and or freezes to the point where a hard reset is necessary which is not what i would consider ""good working condition"". the battery lasts maybe 3 hours of constant use and even when you don't touch it all day its dead by the evening, for example, today it lasted 10 hours on a full charge. the charging port is loose so it doesn't always charge during the night and is basically dead when i get up to go to work. If i play Pandora it dies by lunch. it seems like when i need it the most its either dead or freezes the whole screen keeping me from doing anything. It feels like someone used the phone for three years, it started causing problems so they sold the worn out phone before it fully broke. only upside? I did only pay 22 dollars for it so i guess you get what you pay for, and ill be paying for a new phone."	0
"This product seemed cheaply made.  Quality in hand was less than I expected based on description.  But it would be the Motorola manufacturing that would address this situation..  Motorola brand is why I chose to purchase this and I do like Motorola products, but this one was of the lowest quality for me."	0
this product that I purchased I never received cause after the purchase the seller no longer was a member of ebay. have not yet received the product which I never will and my refund not yet refunded.	0
"This product was a replacement for another one, so glad that ebay had it available since AT&amp;T no longer carried it, I knew that I could rely Ebay to have this item. Thank you ebay for your awesome service and the shipping was right on time too"	1
This product was awful the phone is defective dont buy it . 	0
"This product was completely destroyed when I got it, and when I went to return it, the sell shut down their ebay account and didn&apos;t refund my purchase. Very unhappy."	0
This product was just as subscribed! Great communication from the seller and fast shipping! Phones excellent just as described and couldnt be happier! A+++++	1
"This product was not as advertised.  I returned it to the seller and asked for my return postage but they did not send that back to me.  They did return the original amount paid.  Also, I specified that it must be unlocked to AT&amp;T but it was not.  I took it to my local AT&amp;T store and they could not get it to work.  They said it was a poor quality so I returned it."	0
This product was received on time and in great condition as described. The product works great and I am very pleased with this service and product.	1
This product was sold as advertised. Also it was shipped and received in perfect condition and on time.	1
"This product was suppose to be new, it was not. it was refurbished and they used aftermarket parts.  it cost me an additional $198.00 to have it repaired so I could use it.  because of time restraints, was unable to return the phone."	0
"This product was way cheap. Good Value, and snazzy to!  I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a cheap, replacement flip phone."	1
"This product wont work in India and it was not dual sim, Please don't go by description of the product provided by seller check the model number.  I had internet connectivity issues when using this mobile other than At&T carriers and it also wont display the contact number of the person calling you "	0
This product works great and it was it great shape! Thank you very much! I would get more products from this person!!!	1
This produt did not work.  I had to return it with more money.  I am still waiting to get a replacement.  I do NOT recommend this product or this seller!	0
"This purchase unlike my other experiences w/ ebay was terrible. 2 phones in a row were sold with bad esn #s then it is my responsibilty to pay for return shipping. What a pain in the butt- my time, no phone, and hours of time dealing with it. All one has to do is call the phone provider and ask for a esn # check. Simple but not done by sellers. E bay needs to crack down on these guys and guarentee that phones sold and not part of insurance fraud and are usable by consumer which is why I bought it.   making me reconsider ebay use and I have been a happy camper till now. Come on and take steps to protect your consumers and make your sellers sell what they advertise."	0
This purchase was just as it was described.  Good deal for the price I paid for this phone. I really liked the phone.	1
"This really is a great phone to use! Easy to use and if you don&apos;t want a smart phone this is the phone to use! I can still use facebook, etc in an easy form."	1
This reconditioned LG G4 VS986 arrived in very good condition.  It was upgraded to Android 6.0 and is working perfectly.	1
"This replaced my wife's 8 year old flip phone.  She loves her new Kyocera Dura XTP - E4281 phone. It was very easy to get the phone activated with our carrier, Sprint. The battery last her 3-4 days before it needs to be charged. This is even with  heavy usage. Highly recommend this durable flip phone.   Update 10-7-17. Still working great. Wife is ""happy"". When she is happy I am happy! "	1
"This review is not about the phone but about my first experience using Ebay, it SUCKED.   One I was ripped off from the start, the seller never shipped the item, second Paypal only refunds up to $200, so I was out $98.  I will never use Ebay again as it seems to be more steered towards protecting the seller as opposed to protecting the buyer."	0
"This reviews pages are nonsense ! You cannot leave 1 star (poor) review just because your seller sold you crap. Reviews should be written for a products and not for a bad sellers. It&apos;s a great phone with many useful functions even with original Android 1.6 OS. It has nice &amp; big screen, good qwerty keyboard and it works pretty fast with original software. Also, you can upgrade it to Android 2.2 if you&apos;re willing to spend some time on community forums. With Android 2.2, G1 gets new life and can be compared with latest Android devices. If I consider eBay prices (in this moment under $100) for a good used G1 phone, I would give 5 stars for this first (ever) HTC Android phone."	1
This same phone is available at Walmart & Walmarts website for $18.	0
This Samsung S7 phone is a great value! Price and shipping is fantastic. Could not ask for a better seller to get a great product to you.	1
"This screen was just what we were looking for. It's durable and pretty easy to set up. Since we were installing it in our basement on a concrete wall, the velcro was not strong enough to hold it up, so we bought some industrial strength velcro from Walmart and it worked perfectly. The screen is nice and thick so you can't see through it. It works really well with the projector we have. It allows for a clear picture (not pixelated). We would highly recommend this screen."	1
This seems like a scam and I would even say that eBay is responsible because without them they would not have stolen me so more than 400 U $ S	0
"This seller (listed as Ryan Ni, Ebay ID: m6coupse, e-mail addy: username@berkeley.edu ) did not respond to my e-mails to confirm he received my paypal payment, mailed the item, or was no longer interested in sending the item to me.  I was forced to file an ebay claim and he still has not responded.  I AM SO TIRED OF FAKE EBAY SELLERS!!!!"	0
this seller buy this box from me it is not original box neither the accessories i refund him his money and he didn't returned it to me this man is thief 	0
This seller cancels orders for no reason!	0
This seller deceiver. I  bought 2  Nokia Lumia 810 - 8GB - Black (Unlocked) Smartphone and been send both of them to another country. Both items are NOT UNLOCKD.	0
This seller deserves more than 5 star. I did not test the phone still but they try hard to deliver and make the customer happy. Thank you	1
"This seller did not indicate that the phone was locked and unlockable. It was only usuable through US Cellular which I never heard of. I paid $400 for the phone and it is worthless to me. When I wrote the seller, she took a &quot;not my problem&quot; attitude. I intend to dispute the item because she refuses to take it back. She did not disclose this to me prior to purchasing. Watch out for her!!!!"	0
This seller didn't even send the damn phone. Took my money and never replied. Don't buy from this crooked seller	0
This seller does not deliver the product as advertised. I received a phone that said &quot;E55&quot; on it and it didn&apos;t come with protective plastic over screen. The build of the phone was of poor quality and the back panel was slightly bent. When I tried contacting the seller I got no reply. DO NOT BUY THIS	0
"this seller first sais it was for metro pcs but after he shipped it that cost me 5.00 for shipping and cost him only 2.20 it was not a metro and the charger he said he was sending was a car charger, he did say i could send it back but i bought the phone for 10.00 and spent 5.00 for shipping so how much money should i put into this phone. he should have messaged me before shipping out the phone telling me it was not for metro pcs now the phone sits in a draw. i would never buy anything from this seller again, he was very shady"	0
This seller goes above and beyond. Do not hesitate to purchase from them. 	1
"This seller had incredibly fast shipping. The phone came in immaculate condition, and is the best purchase I think I have ever gotten on eBay! Highly recommend this seller"	1
This seller has agreed to refund  my money even though it was stated in the beginning that it was a no return item. since this item did not work. I have sent it back and I am waiting for my refund but he/she did reply and apologized and asked for my email so they could send my refund.	0
This seller has been reported to ebay  He is a liar and a thief  due to his inexperience i got dinged by ebay and he got nothing even tho my rating is substanially higher  Would i buy from this seller...NO run now	0
"this seller has the worst communication in the world, I bought two pink phones, one or two days after he answered: &quot;Sorry sir we get out of stock I have only black and gold&quot; as it was a gift for my mother and my wife, I could not deny.  he send me back $ &quot;20&quot;, which were $ 18.50 because Paypal charges a commissions transaction.I asked the two phones come involved, and only one came in as requested.no other comments... he combined the shipping and not sent me the $ 9.99 back..."	0

This seller is a scammer! Plan on reporting them!	0
"This seller is a total fraud, one of the worst sellers in eBay. They NEVER send me the item and they continuously told me lies about the shipment.   They even told me that there was a mistake and  that they would refunded me as soon as possible, but never did it.  As a buyer from 2008 and with a 100% positive feedback with my transactions, i expected a more descent treatment. I didn&apos;t opened a case in paypal because they asked for patience and i tries to be reasonable. But those guys waited to pass the 40 days limit for the open case and they never refunded me. They didn&apos;t answer to my questions after this period of time.  They are total fraud and scrap. The worst in ebay"	0
"This seller is amazing very fast shipping and the phone looked brand new , love my new s7 edge "	1
"This seller is bogus and a fake!! Dont buy from this seller, took my money, cancelled the product and refused to refund the money, when I investigated they said, something went wrong with my address , Funny I received all other orders from EBay without delay. Stay away from this seller!!!"	0
"This seller is crap. Selling new phones that arent new, seller says they are new condition. What exactly is that? Sounds like used to me. Also it is advertised to be compatible with any carrier but it didnt work with straight talk, even tho I messaged the seller before buying. And the return process is a nightmare, still trying to get my money back. Not to mention just a rude person. Just spend the extra hundred bucks or so to get a for real new one, trust me. "	0
"This seller is excellent. I actually got the gold RAZR V3 and it is excellent. It came with everything: both car and AC chargers, and an international AC adaptor for travel. Quick shipping and great service!"	1
This seller is fraudlent.Not sure how he can say he dont have the phone when i won the item. He was possibily expecting more .He is a cheater so stay away from hime. he says he dosent care if ebay deletes his account .so DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY bidding with this fraud.	0
this seller is good but his phones or not worth your time he takes care of it but again if he replaces it you might get something u dont wont	0
This seller is great... I made a grave mistake with a payment option and he corrected it without question. He had no obligation to help me but he was glad to.. Will do business with him for years to come... 	1
This seller is my life saver. Great price for excellent product and fast shipping. Thanks so much!	1
"THIS SELLER IS NOT RESPONSABLE, MY HUSBAND BOUGHT 2 OF THEM IN VERY DISGUSTING CONDITION, SELLER REPORTED TO E-BAY THAT HE/SHE OFFERED A REFUND, BUT IT'S NOT TRUE. DO NOT BUY NOTHING TO THIS SELLER...   DO NOT BUY / DO NOT BUY !!!!!!!!!!!!"	0
"This seller is really a liar,he said that the phone is unlocked but it's not,so  everybody must be aware of this."	0
This seller is selling fake phones. do not buy from this seller.	0
"This seller is selling RESTRICTED, COUNTERFEIT, AGAINST EBAY POLICY ELECTRONICS  DO NOT PURCHASE - REPORT!"	0
"This seller is very careful in the way he packaged my android phone. Not to mention he put it in the original box with all of the manuals, the charger, usb and head phones that came with the phone. He also left the memory stick in the phone. He didnt leave anything out. The phone looks like I just picked it up from the manufacturer brand new. I recomend this seller to anyone out there! He is honest, FAST and meticulous."	1
This seller is way overpriced	0
"This seller knows what they're doing! The description said minor signs of use but there's only a single scratch on the back. Phone felt like new otherwise! They even upgraded my shipping to 2 day by FedEx, beyond what I was expecting! There's even a return label printed, which I've never seen any company do for you before. The phone itself is great! Probably could do with a better battery, but that's not the seller's fault. Neither is the power button location, so I won't take stars off for that. All in all, if you're looking for a great used phone and want the best possible product (and service beyond what you expect during purchase) for your money, I'd highly recommend this seller. 10/10"	1
"This seller listed the cellphone as being unlocked, but it is defective electronically and continues to relock on its on. There was no notice in the ad depicting defects, but its a piece of junk. Beware !!!!!"	0
This seller mailed the morning after I won the bid. It arrived within two days - the day befor Christmas Eve!    I&apos;ll be adding them to my favorites!	1

This seller on eBay is the worst person I've ever dealt with in my life use use profanity towards me in one of my emails to him trying to find out where my phone was located that I purchase gave me the run-around telling me that it was mailed had to call several different post offices neither one of them received the item ever was scanned into their system is seller kept telling me that it was scanned and on its way and it was never even skin in either one of the post offices that he mentioned got upset with me told me that I was harassing him because I wanted to know where my phone was since January 1st today is January 4th still no tracking showing nothing but a liar will never do business with him again	0
this seller publishes good articles and sends damaged items .. and then he is not responsible for anything ... he does not buy anybody please is the worst seller in the world.  see the photo all please if they buy this irresponsible so they will send their products ... then they are not responsible	0
"This seller refused to take the phone back when I discovered Verizon would not activate it on their network since it was not 911 compatible.  Further, the seller does not take paypal and insists on getting your credit card number, which makes me suspicous.  Do not buy this phone or deal with this seller."	0

This seller sent an iPhone that doesn&apos;t work and does not respond to emails. His ad stated that the phone was in working condition but then later he emails me after the fact stating that he needed to get the phone checked out by the apple store. I told him I didn&apos;t want the item at that time but he&apos;s refusing to do what&apos;s right. Please be aware of this seller.	0
This seller sent me a phone that only works with cricket after selling as a CDMA unlocked phone. When I asked to return it they were VERY RUDE when I asked for a return label with the address that they asked me to send it to. This was not the same address on the return label that was sent. Don't buy a phone from this seller or you may have a surprise!  	0
This seller should be ashamed for selling a phone like that am very unhappy about it 	0
This seller sold me a counterfeit I phone.  Identified as such by an Apple tech at an Apple genius bar.  It had two different Id numbers was supposed to have 64 gig but the tech could only find 16 even though the phone it self claimed to have 64gig.  This was found out when the phone was taken to Apple because touch screen stopped working and sims chip couldn't be removed.  	0
This seller sold me a phnoe that I paid immediatly for it.  Then he sends me an email the next day( on an overnite ship)and says that he doesn&apos;t have the phone and needs to charge me to link to another company to bye it direct or I can have my money back. Either way this is not the way you do bussiness anywhere. Ir the seller can&apos;t supply he shouldn&apos;t be selling!!!!!!!!!                                   Disatisfied customer	0
"This seller sold me this phone months back, and i have sent tons of messages about my refund! I was new to ebay returns and did not know how it worked. I sent him a message telling him that the product was not working. He said sorry and asked me to return the item by mail so he can give me a refund! I paid the item and the shipping but after that i never heard from this seller. Im so helpless coz i cant go through the ebay seller protection, i thought this seller would actually work with me. "	0
This seller was great!  Delivery time was 12/21 to 12/26....received it 12/23....thank you! In excellent condition.  Would recommend this seller	1
This seller was out looking to scam people on ebay charging them money to show them how to buy nokia phone8801 for cheap. Firstly it said on the add on ebay $140.00 is for the phone nokia 8801 &amp; then at the bottom in fine prints it said it was for the site where you could find those phones for cheap. I think this seller should be removed &amp; fined for misleading people &amp; expecting people to pay them hundred + dollars just for a site which could not be true.	0
"THIS SELLER WAS REALLY HORRIBLE.  DID NOT RESPOND TO MY NUMEROUS EMAILS ABOUT WRONG ITEM BEING SENT...PHONE WAS LOCKED AND NOT ADVERTISED AS LOCKED.  ABSOLUTELY NO HELP FROM SELLER AND AGAIN, LACK OF COMMUNICATION A REAL PROBLEM. DOES NOT PAY ATTENTION TO DETAILS (I BOUGHT TWO PHONES AND BOTH WERE LOCKED AND THE WRONG PHONES WERE SENT.) HORRIBLE TRANSACTIONS."	0
This seller was very quick to deliver the phone. I'm impressed! More people should deal with this seller.       Awesome phone 	1
This seller will scam you!	0
This senior phone is not senior friendlt! I have had 7 email communications with the seller trying to increase the incoming volume & when it could not be done he will not let me return it. My husband is 83 & hard of hearing & he still will not give me authorization to return.  Not happy.	0
This shipping is outta this world 2 day shipping and theres nearly any scratches on the phone and the price is amazing this is like new but it doesn't come with the Samsung box or right charger	1
"This should not be labeled both AT&T and T-Mobile as the hotspot doesn't work on T-mobile without rooting the device to permit changing settings.  The screen burn problem on this device has to be fixed several times a day even keeping the brightness so low it is barely visible.  The battery drains so very quickly from a negligible amount of use. The USB cable sent with it was broken. The seller wouldn't replace the cable and gave irrelevant recommendations related to the battery and the cable.  Moreover, this phone runs slowly and hangs. This phone had too many things wrong with it when it was sold to me for it to be ethical to sell to another person. The nature of what's wrong with it took a gradual use in different contexts to become fully realized.  "	0
"This small smart phone that will fit in the palm of your hand, looks and feels like a Razr but that is where the similarities end.  The lower half of this flip phone is a fully functioning QWERTY KEYBOARD as well as dialing pad.  The entire upper half of this flip phone is a color monitor screen and there is a second screen on the outside of the flip that shows the Time, Caller I.D., Everything you need to know before you open up to answer or call out.  Being an alumni of Kansas State University ( the original home of PURPLE PRIDE ) and now being a (30) year resident of Fort Worth, Texas ( the only home of the 11-0 TCU HORN FROGS ) As Jimmy Johnson would say ( How Bout Those Purple Horny Toads !!)I am proud to tell you this LG LX600 Lotus comes in a Great Deep Purple so you can  show your colors without hurting the feelings of all the UT, SMU and OU fans.  This phone handles your calendar, checks and sends your e-mail, browse the Internet ( Aren&apos;t you glad Al Gore invented that? ), takes pictures or 75 second videos, will handle all Bluetooth accessories and will replace your need for a MP3 player or iPod, in general has every bell and whistle known to the human race or needed all in a very well made, compact, easy to handle flip phone.  If you don&apos;t already have one, go get one NOW you won&apos;t regret it."	1
This smartphone fail you wireles after the month   Fatality    Not recomended noting...	0
"This smartphone is perfect for my husband who is a smartphone novice.  I wish that the battery life were better, but I would buy this phone again."	1
"This Smartphone was nightmare for me, works very very slow, system errors are a  lot, especially when you&apos;re getting a lot of messages. Battery life is extremely poor, only 1 day (!)"	0
"This Sony Ericsson T316 was even better than I expected.  I purchased it for my 12 yr old granddaughter and I was concerned about it not being a flip phone. But it has such great technology and works so well... she loves it. With the buttons exposed all the time, I was concerned that she would be making calls without intending to, but it goes into key locked mode after 15 seconds of non use and unlocking the keys is quite easy. Texting is easy and my granddaughter texts a lot! Plus it has bluetooth and the main control button works like a mouse!  Great technology and works well.  My granddaughter was extremely pleased with it and I got it &quot;for a song&quot; in comparison with the value of the phone. I would highly recommend the phone and if I had not just upgraded my phone, I would be looking for an Ericsson T316 for myself.  Thanks,  Linda F."	1
"This tablet have too many problems I don't know where to begin first of all you get what you pay for I'm going to run down some of the list ok here we go the battery,the pictures,the internet,the call drop in the middle of a conversation,the tablet freezes up without a warning like I said it's just a few I can run down to you"	0
"THIS TELEPHONE IS NOT WORTH IT. IT IS ONLY COPY IS NOT ORIGINAL, IT IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THE TELEPHONE COMPANIES IT IS A FRAUD THAT WAS SPECIFIED THAT THE SELLER THEREFORE DOES NOT ACCEPT RETURNS. THAT'S WHY IT IS ESSENTIAL AND ONE IS RESPONSIBLE IF BET OR NOT. BUT THE DESCRIPTION DOES NOT SPECIFY THAT A COPY IS NOT ORIGINAL"	0
This thing has outstanding battery life and a fantastic camera. This has the best fingerprint sensor I have ever used and this is the best mid-range phone I have ever used. 	1
"This thing is not NOT and unlocked AT&T phone. When you turn it on, the boot screen says ""SPRINT"". Because of this it is only 3G and not 4G. It will never fully work correctly on AT&T. I've been had. I would return but which liar do I believe next?"	0
"This Tracfone is easy to use and has all the features that I need. Very pleased with the product and the cost. Thanks, Karl"	1
"This transaction was very unsatisfactory.  We received the iphone quickly, and just as quickly, it became unstable and is no longer usable.  We feel like this is fraud, and misrepresentation of what we purchased."	0
"This turned out awesome.  My girlfriend loved it.  I wanted to get her a razr like her old one but better so she could save and play music/videos.  This was the perfect solution the RAZR v3i is just that a razr with exturnal memory.  However at first we were a little bumbed because she could not send or receive pictures on this unlocked phone.  But, happy day, I found a link to Motorola&apos;s website that shows you how to send the MMS setting for multimediaPicture sending and receiveing and now she and I are very happy with it.  Thank you unlockcellphonekings."	1
This unit did not charge right out of the box finally got it going after wiggling the plug enough long story short sent it in 4 times for the same problem. Never did get fixed. the fort time they said they couldn't find anything wrong with it it arrived dead and they would not take a charge. They said any further repairs I would have to pay for it cuz it is now out of warranty.	0
This unit replaced one which went thru the wash machine  The price was excellent  The battery does not hold charge very long	1
"This unit was pretty to look at, polished, unblemished and delivered safely packed, on schedule  This Unit needed to receive and transmit AT&T 3G signals. It could not do that. We tried to set it up at our local AT&T Franchise store.  Without the ability to operate in a 3G environment it serves no useful purpose.  The price of failure is low so I will buy another in hope of getting an operating unit. This unit was manufactured in 2007 and is the only unit that forces AT&T to deliver Communication to our location."	0
"This used iPhone 4 was in great condition, it looks like new. Quick delivery too. It came with all the basic accessories, that was a surprise."	1

This was a birthday present for my husband and it was perfect!	1
"This was a Christmas gift for my niece. She charged it overnight. as of Jan 4 2016, she is having battery issues.  The phone keeps powering down. Called T-mobile customer support they said its a battery problem. Changed the battery a couple times. It stabilizes for 24 hrs, then goes back to powering down.  I would not recommend buying this phone."	0
"This was a cute little phone. I purchased it at the time as I wanted to upgrade to a better phone. It was very easy to handle and small enough to put in a pocket or front of a pocketbook. I loved the wallpaper that came with the phone and the ringtones, one epescially, I dream of jeanie theme song, that was so cute. Overall,an excellent phone."	1
"This was a gift  for my brother and his wife. We have two of these and I refer to these phones as the Swiss Army Knife of Android. Very little it can't do from speaking GPS directions on long or short trips to using all of it's features - the camera, video recorder, sound recorder, music player, calc, Bluetooth, etc. There's really not much to add to this phone."	1
THIS WAS A GIFT FOR A FRIEND. SHE IS VERY HAPPY WITH THIS PHONE. WAS VERY EXCITED TO GET. ALREADY REFERRED A FRIEND OF HERS TO THE SELLER. THANK YOU FOR THE QUALITY AND FAST SHIPPING.	1
This was a good deal and worked like a charm.	1
This was a good phone. But my fist phone I bought thru ebay sucks. The reason I even bought this phone was because yhe first one didnt work .I sent it back by regular mail an the postage recipe two monrhs ago an havnt been reimbursed yet	0
this was a great  deal on this phone the phone works great its just as good than the one from t-mobile	1
This was a great buy for me. It is just simple enough and best of all in very good shape. I was able to get it working thru Sprint without any problems.	1
This was a great deal	1
"This was a great deal! Fast shipping. Would definitely purchase from this seller again.  The phone itself works fantastic, just like new. Extremely happy. Thank you!!"	1
"This was a great item just as advertised.  The shipping was quick and great communication. Thanks, Great seller would buy from them again"	1
This was a great purchase for our son. The features are amazing- from printing photos from the small disk to the recording feature.	1
This was a great purchase..Thank u for the quality of the phone	1
"This was a great transaction.  The top of the line Net 10 phone was an excellent value.  I&apos;ve been using the Net 10 service for several years and am extremely satisfied.  The opportunity to upgrade to their best phone was just too good to pass up -- phone was free and the minutes came out to 4.5 cents apiece.  The phone is in excellent condition and I&apos;m enjoying the many features -- MP3 player, camera, etc., etc."	1
This was a lost cause!! Terrible!! 	0
This was a new defective device that I spent hours on the phone with Tracfone trying to activate properly.  I contacted the seller but they never even bothered to reply to my quiery.  I wound up buying another phone. This was definitely a manufacturer problem but the seller still should have acknowledged me.	0
"This was a perfect phone. Had to work today with Sprint but well worth the money. Sprint issue not the phone but once online dammmmmmm it was great, you are on my favorite list."	1
"This was a phone that I purchased for my Mother in rehab.  She said she really likes the phone. Have not seen or used it but, seems to work good for her.    Thanks"	1
This was a replacement for the same phone which I love. This phone heated up and dropped calls on a frequent and regular basis. It was returned pending replacement of same model.	0
"This was a SCAM. The seller sent me a phone that was factory locked by t-Mobil. I took the phone to the Verizon store and contacted Apple and they were not able to unlock it, but they did tell me that there was no way that the previous owner would not have known that it was locked.   I contacted the seller to request a refund, explaining that the phone was locked, and he refused to issue a refund. His response was basically no. it is unlocked.   Im now having to go through PayPal to get my money back.   Do NOT buy from this seller. He is a CON ARTIST.  "	0
"This was a terrific value - 49.99 for phone, one year service, 1500 mins, and 1500 texts - was so easy to transfer to my old tracphone and customer service was terrific as well."	1
This was a used phone purchase. Condition was like new. The phone was purchased to use on AT&amp;T pay as you plan for tethered Internet connectivity to a laptop computer using the phone&apos;s internal modem. Works great and a lot cheaper than an air card when only limited Internet access is needed. No regrets.	1
This was a very good phone for the money. I bought it for one of my employees &amp; all they need is a basic phone. This phone suited our purposes and was a great value.	1
This was actually the third razr v3 phone i have purchase they last about 2 years or so probbaly longer but I  bought them for my parents who arn&apos;t that tech savy and all they wanted was to make calls and it did just that with good battery life.	1
"This was advertised as New and In-the-box.  Not so:  the box doesn't have the same IMEI number as the phone has; the power plug is for and LG phone instead of a Pantech (and doesn't work, anyway); there was no screen protector in the box ... instead it came with an extra battery.  So, the phone seems to work well and I'm sticking with it; but I don't have a great deal of residual faith in the seller."	0
This was an AWSOME PURCHASE!! Just as described and works perfectly! I highly recommend this seller&apos;s products!	1
"This was an excellent deal, I am very satisfied with the product. Iphones are the best! The item was shipped very quickly! Thank you seller, thank you ebay!"	1
THIS WAS AN EXCELLENT TRANSACTION AND A GREAT PHONE. IT CAME WITH MANY ACCESSORIES AND THE PHONE WORKS GREAT NO ISSUES. IT WAS UNLOCKED SO WE CAN USED ANY PREPAID CARRIER. OVER ALL VERY SATISFIED CUSTOMER	1
"THIS WAS AN OLD REVIEW FOR V3 RAZR, I HAVE CHOCOLATE TOUCH NOW.    While I like my RAZR v3m, I find that the battery has gone down, even when I replaced it and the phone keeps restarting."	0
"This was bought to replace my partners old nokia 6136 clamshell phone.  Have to admit he was looking for something easy to use similar to what he had but with better technology and this suited him perfectly.    The robust design of this phone means that it takes a fair few knocks and bangs without falling apart.  I&apos;m afraid to say that he did get bought a HTC S710 and had it wrecked within 3 weeks, broken screen and you couldn&apos;t hear anything..lol.  The nokia 6085 suits him perfectly and function wise it has everything that he needs, no it isn&apos;t touch screen with all the bells and whistles that alot of the phones seem to have now, but form and function it works perfectly and being a nokia it&apos;s design is fantastic."	1
This was cancelled by the vendor.    Never received the item.  Nothing to review so cannot give a positive experience about the product.  No favorable comments for this vendor.	0
"This was exactly want I wanted,  awesome phone. "	1
"This was great! Came with a case and screen protector, all accessories as described. Was new, as described. Powered up and worked for me right away. The little guide that came with it was helpful in setting up my phone. I am a happy camper."	1
This was in excellent condition like new. Everything works great. Charger is a low amp slow charger. Not the Google fast charger. Love the adapter's it comes with. Easy to transfer all files from old phone using cord and built in software.  Very happy after two weeks of use.	1
"this was listed as U.S. Cellular as the carrier , and when I recieved it , it was Sprint , for the carrier , and I cannot use it , it was a total waste of my time , and money , spent ,, furthermore the seller refused to do anything to resolve the issue , , and then Ebay , already removed the item  from my  list , of what Items I purchased , via pay pal ..so I have no course of action I can take , against the seller  to return it , and recieve a refund .."	0
"This was my exchange with the shipper after I received the phone. As you'll see, he did not tell me how to return the phone but instead whined about how much money he would lose (I already knew that I would be responsible for the return shipping, so it wasn't that). In addition, the phone was cheap and clunky, and I hated it. After his response, I decided to just donate the phone to my local women's center, but I will never use this vendor again because of his reluctance to stand behind his statements online and for merchandise that is not as described.  ME: I thought, after careful research, that I was buying an unlocked flip phone that I could insert my large SIM card into and use my existing phone carrier (PureTalk), but the phone came with a label that said the large SIM card slot was for T-Mobile only. I inserted the battery and my SIM card anyway, to see if it worked, and it didn't, so I need to return it. Please let me know the procedure.  HIM: You can easily make replace the SIM card to a smaller one and use this phone You have nothing to lose, Return this phone means a loss of $7 for me I think you can help changing your SIM card to a smalller one"	0
This was my first purchase ever on ebay where the seller responded quickly to a few small issues and resolved them immediately every time . Will definitely purchase from this seller again ! The product itself is of great quality and works perfectly 	1
This was my first purchase on eBay I did not receive my phone but my money was return back but it does my me a little scare to make another purchase	0
"This was my first smartphone, i have only had the phone a week and the memory is almost full, also i am having to charge the phone at night and at least once during the day. it is however very user friendly and not too big. if i had it to do again and know what i know now i would not have purchased this phone for myself. it may be a good first smartphone for a child."	0
This was my first time buying on eBay which suck completely. So he tried to pass a bad father to me knowingly that it had the effect on the battery and it overheats this dude should not be selling Electronics on eBay shut him down	0
"This was my first Windows phone.  I liked it so much, I bought a Windows 8.1 phone and gave this one to a friend."	1
This was not a good purchase. We have tried numerous times to get this phone activated by sprint says it&apos;s locked.	0
THIS WAS NOT PURCHASE. IT WAS A SCAM. LISTING WAS PULLED BY EBAY. SELLER NEVER CONTACTED ME OR SHIPPED ITEM. HAD TO FILE THROUGH PAYPAL TO GET MY MONEY BACK.    BEWARE.	0
This was not what I was looking for so they returned my money immediately and I was just in awe of them. Will use this seller again so honest!	1
This was one of the worst phones I have ever owned! Phone was constantly freezing and turning off for No reason. Phone would turn itself off in middle of calls or while texting. VERY UNSATISFIED!!!!!! 	0
This was purchased for a friend who was leaving to Ecuador. She says it works just fine and loves her phone.	1
This was scam and my ebay and paypal accounts were hacked!!! I did not receive a phone!!!	0
"THIS WAS SUCH A RIP OFF! I went to go activate it and the phone was registered as stolen so it cannot be activated ever! So I bought this phone for no reason, I can&apos;t do anything with it!"	0
This was supposed to be a new phone but it isn&apos;t new  This guy is a SCAM watch out!!!  I bought this phone and it had ARABIC letters on it and   it looked like the phone was used when I opened it up to see inside.  This guy is a scammer WATCH OUT!!	0
"This was supposed to be an unlocked GSM iphone, compatible with any network. Shame on me for not thoroughly testing prior to my trip. First day in Amsterdam, I discovered there was a crack in the camera lens, allowing condensation to fog all of the photos. Arrived in Kenya and purchased a local SIM card. Installed it and was prompted for a PIN, which of course I did not have. So I ended up purchasing a cheap phone from the local carrier. Upon my return to the States, I contacted ATT to get the phone unlocked. ATT says it is now unlocked, but it still won't respond to a SIM card from an independent carrier. At least it was only a $50 mistake."	0
"This was the 2nd time I purchased a Galaxy S4 from this seller.  While the seller was prompt with the initial refund (and I expect them to be so for the 2nd as well), both phones showed significant signs of defectiveness within the first 2 weeks.  I'll be moving on.  "	0
This was the biggest mistake purchase I have ever made in my life. I have returned the phone to Herbert.	0
"This was the first time I  actually used ebay and I was extremely pleased with the entire process. I was initially afraid to bid for the phone, but I had a ball with the bidding process and excited when I won the bid. I bought the Blackberry Curve 8530 for my daughter&apos;s birthday. She was so surprise and excited that you would&apos;ve thought I gave her a million dollars. Needless to say that she loves her new phone. I have ordered several items on ebay since then and will continue to use ebay in the future.  Great items at Great prices!"	1
This was the stupidest thing ever. It was 20$ wasted for me. I thought it was the phone but it was just a stupid promo code that didn&apos;t even work because my contract wasn&apos;t up! UGH!	0
this was the worst item i had ever bought. i got the item twice and both times it was defective. And they never gave me my money back either. the seller is a theif!!!!!	0
This was the worst phone purchasing experience I have personally ever had.  Ordered this phone for my stepfather and had to jump through 90 different hoops to try and activate it only to find out that there was no way that we could.  So I fully plan on getting my money back for this phone.  It wasn&apos;t even sent with the correct battery and we had to order and pay for a new one only to find out that wouldn&apos;t help either.	0
"This was the worst purchase I ever made through EBay. And finally my last! Done with this company! The seller sent this phone to a working address. Never put my hands on it. The seller was unresponsive after several emails. Ebay didnt trust me after several evidences, including a USPS gps tracking with the right address where this iPhone was delivered. Honestly, Ebay should add on it police a line about respect, for the main reason Im done with it is because I was treated like a trash. Sellers like this should be banned immediately as well, for their lack of responsibility. "	0
"This was the worst purchase that I made on Ebay...The phone was so slow. You couldn't hear or people couldn't hear you, the sound would just go out.  It would dial on it's own.  I shouldn't have to take the time out of my day to send this phone back to get my money back...I took the phone to T-Mobile and they agreed ""it's cute"" but it was a piece of crap.  I have never had a problem with a phone being  sooooooo slow.  I had to purchase a new phone after one week. And I am not paying shipping to send this phone back because I not sure if I'm going to get my money back.  I don't trust this company and I'm not willing to take the risk."	0
"This was to replace my old unit that had an accident. The phone wsa working fine after years of use and all I needed was a basic phone so I thought &quot;Why not buy another?&quot;    The replacement is working as well as the first. Camera, text (not a qwerty keypad!) and photo messaging fine, reception fine, volume fine. Just like a new phone. Would get another if I needed one. This is a rugged unit. The flip open hinge is solid and the display clear and large enough for most usage.     If you want to get on the internet, this will do it, but I would recommend a newer phone with a big screen. But if what you need is a tough little phone that reliably takes and makes calls, has good ringer volume plus vibrate and is easy to use this is it. Oldies sometimes are goodies!"	1
This was very fast and pain free transaction i would buy from this seller all the time.thank you so much.	1
"This watch is suppose to be a standalone watch using a micro sim card.  It did not work with my 3G ATT sim card.  I could not make or receive calls.  The keyboard is so small  that it is almost impossible to type if text input is required, and it is for many apps.  It does have a workable camera and a voice recorder.  "	0
This worked fine for about three weeks than I started having problems such as can not connect to the Internet or wifi than the phone starts to overheat when charging and does not stay charge for long	0
this works perfectly easy set up and use. I would buy the same if buying again.	1
This yellow Iphone 5c should have never been sold.  Not only is it jumping on the screen but it has a crack inside which may be the cause of the glitch.  I bought this as a gift for my 13 year old needless to say I was crushed when I got it.  I have had two used I phone for more than 6 months now they work great. There was minor scratches could live with but the damage takes away from the great use of the Iphone itself.   Please be more upfront with your damaged items.  	0
Those thinking about buying one of these Don't As of 01/01/2017 they will know longer work. I got one and it ask for a code so I emailed the dealer and he told me to take it to AT&T. And they told me there was nothing they could do because it was a 2G and they will be phased out. Hope this helps some one.  Paul	0
"Though used the condition of the phone was excellent, I keep finding better uses, tools and apps for the phone. My kids like it better than their I phones (3G)"	1
Thought it is a nice product and cheap but the seller sent the defaulted product which was not working and returned it by post and waiting for a refund?	0
"Thought the price was right and would enjoy the features.Did not care for the phone when I received it and trying using, for me was more complicated than I wanted.  Will go to authorized dealer in the future. Contacted 24 hr deals about returning it and their comment was &quot;we are a small family owned business and unless the phone is in PERFECT condition we will not accept back&quot;  I had inserted my battery and tried using so of course it was not PERFECT.  Therefore I am stuck with a phone I don&apos;t like and and won&apos;t use"	0

T-Mobile does not manufacture the SIM card anymore that works in this phone.  So the phone won't work. So I just threw away the money I spent to purchase the phone. Not Happy!	0
T-mobile lets you add blackberry data. Unlocking cost about $5 so if you want for T-mobile then it's a go. Otherwise there are no internet services for this phone with AT&T GoPhone.	0
"To any one out there wanting a touch screen phone and does not want to pay the Fruity price,this is the phone for you.I bought mine and I love it .this is the most responsive touch screen I have ever had comparable to my iPod touch.I Love the phone and would recomend it to any one.The shipping was fast aswell no waiting 2 weeks I got mine in 5 days.The newer slim line sides of the phone make sure that it is not given away as a Sciphone.I would go on and on. But check out this phone I am buying one for my Best friend .One more thing there are alot of extras in the phone already installed."	1
"To be completely honest, this phone is terrible. The buttons will quit working, you just wait. The touch screen will also quit working properly. Whenever I text someone this is what it looks like because my M, L, U, J, ?, and my period and comma don&apos;t work... Hey, do yo want to coe to y hose ? What I am really trying to say is Hey, do you want to come to my house ? BUT NO, not with the KIN. It&apos;s terrible and I only had it for 5 months.."	0
TO BEGAIN WITH. THE PHONE DOES NOT WORK AT ALL. THE SCREEN SHOWS NOTHING HAS BEEN SITTING THERE SINCE I BOUGHT IT.	0

To now I have not received the product was close the case and I still am not able to receive the device.   Seller uncooperative in the search for the problem of shipping	0
"To pay over 1000 is crazy, shit ya can get them at tmobile for $969 or any other company cheaper, plus make cheaper monthly payments like $30.00 a month "	0
"To start off the phone is sleek and stylish with the only ergonomic unlikable feature being that it has an antenna exposed.  The function of the phone is great and clean compared to my old LG 225.  The text messaging works fairly well with the exception of punctuation and predetermined words popping up even while those functions are turned off.  Again this is a step up from my old phone and if I was shopping for phones, I&apos;m not sure if this is the one I&apos;d go with."	0
To summarize I feel Ihave been cheated but I do not know how. First: the device is too expensive in my country it is only 300 $ AD while I paid 588 $AD. I sent my opinion to the seller waiting for thier response but in vain. I am very much regretting uying any item online.  The problem If I returned it back I will lose110 AD plus shipment fees twice costs. I advice everyone not to buy anything from China Hong Kong. Still Ican not exlude ebay from my dissatisfaction as I bought the item putting my trust in them The device is not original. It is a fake	0

Too small. And dont  like	0
Took a little longer getting here for some reason but thats on USPS the phone itself is in great shape and I tested it out on my old sim and its all set to go!	1
Took eight days before it was shipped out and when We got it we found out that it only works with the original SIM that came with the phone witch was not included. Now we have to wait 10 more days to get a replacement SIM. Sent several emails to the seller before it was shipped and never got any response.A little communication on the sellers part would have went a long way. Phone was everything he said it was. Great shape. Just the delay in shipping and lack of communication and now this SIM issue has us more than irritated.	0
"Took it to Verizon - they couldn't make it work, so got my money back."	0
"took order, took money, never responded, never delivered item. Had to reverse charge AMEX. When buying use a credit card for some recourse.    DO NOT BUY HERE!!!"	0
Took over 4 hrs to set up though verizon due to phone issues and then the battery only lasts 2 hrs each charge. 	0
Took this phone to Cuba and would not work with their SIM card. Said it was not unlocked. Had to pay to have it unlocked. 	0
Took too long to ship.   Stated it was new and it is not.  A lot of scratches. 	0
Top internal speaker does not work - will only work on external speaker phone	0
"Top notch Samsung Galaxy S5! If you're looking for a replacement smartphone and don't mind not having the latest/greatest, purchase this phone. Very clean, barely any noticeable wear.  Even the Qualcomm CDMA sticker is on the phone. Display is scratch free and battery life is good ~12 hours of surfing, texting and talking. Speakers don't sound blown and calls are clear. You can purchase a replacement battery for less than  $10 on Amazon if you're a Prime subscriber. SIM card is required unless you are a Verizon customer and are replacing a smartphone within the past 3 years. "	1
"Top phone, i&apos;ve had countless over the years and if all you want is a phone this is great. Battery that lasts a week and easy to use."	1
Top quality. I have had NO problems with 8 out of 8 phones that I purched. Will be a returning customer.	1
Total garbage!  Battery Life app shows battery is 80% destroyed (Apple recommends replacing after 20%).  No way shipper was unaware that they sent me useless product.  Wont even operate while plugged into charger.  Had to get battery replaced by Apple who confirmed battery was in terrible shape.  Cant trust this vendor.	0
"Totally a great phone ,I came from a old s4 an wow. Thanks this is great, so many new an improved "	1
Totally Awesome Phone - Customer Service Can't be Beat - love this store	1
"Totally not the seller&apos;s fault that Cricket has crappy customer service. They sent me my phone on time. It was a really pretty red phone which I was thoroughly excited about using since Cricket was supposed to have great features for a phone without contract. Don&apos;t let Cricket&apos;s service deter you from this seller&apos;s other products. Ssam are great, responsible sellers, and will do what is necessary to help you."	0
Totally satisfied buyer. Seller is a great communicator and thoughtful individual. I highly recommend. 	1

Touch screen is so hard to use and phone just slow.  Very disappointed even if for daughter to use lightly	0
Touch screen was not working properly. The product should have been better examined by the seller.	0

"Tracfone discontinued  NOKIA 1221.  Nokia 1221 Tracfone  is of no use as a normal cellphone, Tracfone will not activate, reactivate Nokia 1221.  MIGHT be useable for 911  but I wouldn&apos;t bet my life on it."	0
Tracfone sells phones that are made for specific area codes and will not assist you when you try to use them in a different area. They will sell you minutes but then not allow your phone to work . We have retailers including Walmart that sell phones that won't work in the same town as the store is located. I consider this a Tracfone shortfall not the seller.  	0
Tracfone won't register this cell I tried everything with tracfone this cell is not on their files I lost my money and time 	0

"Twin SIM is excellent  You need smallish fingers.  Due to its small size battery life is limited, but spare battery supplied with mine.  Have previously owned 2 Chinese phones which were rubbish, this one is fine so far and excellent value for money"	1
Two many things wrong with the phone.	0
"Two stars for great phone condition. Like new. Love it. Fast shipping, great handling time.  One star for seller. The phone came password locked and haven't been reset I had to get the seller contact information from eBay customer service because I've sent the seller a message a couple of days ago and he never responded and so I wasn't very confident on the seller's response time. Contacted the seller through their personal cell left a voicemail and text message and I also left an eBay message as well there was no response. I thought I had to return the product but I found a way to set it to factory reset. I also have to check the ESN myself to make sure it was fine and so far everything clears out. Will not buy from seller again due to lack of communication and phone did not come as described. I had to do extensive research to figure everything out."	0
Two thumbs up. Thanks  	1
"Typically when buying in bulk the price tends to be less per phone, not more. I would think you might get a better price by selling them individually or starting a bid somewhere around $2000-$2500 (for all 4). Good product, but poor price point. Best of luck in future sales!"	0

"un exelente telefono... Lo recomiendo 3.5G, wifi, GPS de todo... Es como una computadora... Le pondria una pantalla mas grande y de mas resolucion, al ser un telefono de la serie E es un telefono empresarial y es dificil conseguir juegos y temas mas que todo para este resolucion de pantalla, en el area multimedia le mejoraria la calidad de sonido del altavoz y mas que todo el volumen, es realmente bajo... Pero si reproduce todo tipo de video y audio.    Una cosa que es lo unico que realmente no  me gusto es que no encuentro como enviar un mms solo de texto, hay que adjuntarle algo para que se transforme automaticamente y al responde un mms tampo se selecciona autometucamente en mms. Eso deberia mejorarlo, que en mi antiguo E50 se podia hacer     Como todo telefono tienes sus cosas, pero en general a la final resulta un exelente telefono inteligente y me encanta."	1

Unable to activate.	0
Unable to get it connected to my carrier will have to return it	0
Unable to review product as it has not arrived after more than three weeks. Hope it shows up soon.	0
Unable to use phone.  Internal malfunction.  Purchased new phone prior to return.  Quick refund from seller.	1
"Unacceptable: At least fifty messages back and forth with the seller and so far and ""Emily"" refuses to address the concern besides stating ""let me check"" ...Also not the first time this happened with a quick online search. Return of faulty products (to a foreign country) should be addressed by seller not the customer. Purchase here if you want a non-US seller and risk of defective product and if you are willing to pay up to $100 for shipping."	0
Understated phone that may be a few years old but still kicks butt	1
Unfair to rate this phone because the product that was sent to us only lasted 5 weeks and died.	0
Unfortunately  this phone will not stay connected to the discard. It keeps rebooting.  The battery discharges faster than it should.  I am Sorry to have to say this.	0
"Unfortunately I lost my +size phone, but I was getting tired of hauling it around anyway. I had decided to go back to a small phone, looked around saw that I could buy this brand new SE with 32 gigs for $30. less than I could at my carrier store, which has 16 gigs. Fast delivery, perfect size, brand new, works great.  "	1
Unfortunately I&apos;m not satisfied with the product because in the description did not included that can&apos;t be use with sync card and my actual company use sync card in all of their product.   The product is not useful for me and can&apos;t return the product.	0
"Unfortunately the phone has a NON CLEAN IMEI number. After two days of working the phone then stopped having access to the network. I called T-mobile and after a 2 day investigation they have claimed they have blocked the IMEI number because the original buy has not paid it off.   This phone was for my wife's business, so this is extremely disruptive."	0
"Unfortunately the phone wasn&apos;t working properly, didn&apos;t receive text messages for hours, and dropped calls.  I think Verizon made their service bad for the phone just so they could get you to buy the more expensive phones.  The company was great though.  Quick service."	0
"Unfortunately the seller sends me this phone with a dead battery & the have not addressed the issue yet. It pains, we order something on eBay & are being cheated by the seller & now we have no control over it."	0
"Unfortunately this particular phone simply did not wor. The battery discharged after a few hours, the buttons did not work and I was not able to activate it. Similar phones bought from this seller worked fine therefor, I did not ask for a refund. Given the low price it was just not worth the effort. But to avoid having the same experience, I recommend not purchasing this item from anyone."	0
"Unfortunately, I never received it.  The seller was very honest and cancelled the order because the camera lens was scratched"	0
"Unfortunately, I&apos;v got a not this stuff that I ordered. This one I received much bad and contains only 2 SIM instead of 3 I wanted. I feel my self like a fool. I am very upset and disillusion... ((("	0
"Unfortunatly the description of this item was not detailed properly. When the seller says the item is above average that doe snot fully give the proper detials of the wear on the item. There were also not enough pictures. The seller did not take pictures of the back of the phone obviously to hide any wear. Yes it was my fault that I did not inquire enough, however the seller needs to provide a greater deal of description to ensure there buyer is happy. Beware from buying from this seller and others like this who know how to word their items in just the right way to protect them from a buyer filling a claim against them."	0
unit did not work. Returned to vendor for refund. Vendor was prompt about refunding the purchase price.	0
"Unit was deactivated by the carrier (t-mobile) within 2 days of me transferring my sim into it, due to the previous owner's not paying their bill.  I was satisfied with the supplier since they did refund my money, although from a consumer standpoint, I also feel that I was deceived, in that my assumption on these phone re-seller's is such that I feel that the items offered for sale are actually valid units, unencumbered by past ownership issues.  IMHO of course.  Good luck with your purchase, and since they only offer your money back if contacted within a week, make sure that you test use the unit quickly."	0

upgraded from a 5 to 6. Did not want to pay for current version ( 10) because they depreciate so fast. My carrier wanted $650 for a Iphone 7. Got this for $340 and very happy with it. Very easy to switch phone myself. Buy a older new model is the only way to go...	1

"Verizon checked phone ID after sim card installed, before activating and confirmed this 'Brand New, Unused...' phone was previously activated and used. Watch these scammers on Ebay... verify with carrier these phones are truly new if you truly demand new as advertised! Seller easily accepted return knowing.   That bar code sticker seal was not on my box either as advertised in this webpage photo. That was the first 'FAIL' . Also missing was the S pen clips and extra tips. This is my second note 4 so I know what it comes with. Scratches in the battery compartment.   These sellers know it was used with the bar code sticker missing and missing accessories. More power to sellers with simpleton customers getting rid of them. Probably used and immediately returned to carriers and sold to 3rd party sellers on Ebay.   "	0

"Very happy with service and phone My only complaint is that the menu system on the phone makes you click four times before you can find someone in the address book, set an alarm, or perform a additional functions. Other phones I&apos;ve owned have simpler menus and get you to important features easily. Overall, I&apos;d recommend the phone if you&apos;re on a budget."	0

I am having the hardest time with my apps and signing into them....I have been trying to sign into Facebook for hours and it constantly timing out....May have to get a different phone. My internet is not the issue.  Love my apps.... But other than the phone itself, got great service, fast shipping. "	0

"Very similar to Verizon&apos;s Razr with Kevlar case. Big screen, surprisingly light, 4G LTE speeds are ridiculous fast, android 4.1.1, using car dock with Motorola smart actions that allows custom configuration. When docked I have it automatically activating mobile hotspot and google maps navigation and automatic replies to text messages all while charging the battery which is needed at some point during the day with moderate use, the price to pay for big screen and LTE speeds. Still learning android and still love iOS but this hardware at these prices make it difficult to look away from android and google play store. Came with quick office installed which one pays for in the apple App Store."	1
Very slow and hard to configure to the carrier network.	0

Very user friendly. Great phone!! I actually like it more than the 5s - seems to holds a better battery charge also. If I had the choice I would go with the 5 not the 5s - at least until I see what a possible &apos;6&apos; looks like.	1

From the beginning, the phone did not work right. It would not get service where other cingular phones got full service. We took his simcard in to have it checked, and found out that it was the phone, not the card. I wasted my money. I would not buy this phone again, nor would I buy from the same people again. This is the first time I&apos;ve gotten ripped off in Ebay!"	0

"Watch out. This product cannot be used by another Operator, just TRACFONE. I've tried of a thousand ways to unblock it and I failed.   In the end of the day I re-sell it for $15. It was a huge loss for me."	0

"We activated this phone through Republic Wireless, but it still doesn't make phone calls no matter what we try to do.  It will go to facebook and snap chat through wifi, but no calls to or from this phone.  We already have two other phones of this type that both work, but we bought them new.  Please send info about how we get this phone to work.  Thank you. "	0
We are happy about the condition of the phone. We are pleased with the purchase and we recommend the seller. Thanks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	1
"We are selling this phone so I had a chance to use one and I must say this phone is incredible! Super fast, smooth to use, easy to navigate with the pen and just great all around!! "	1
"We believe this was a stolen phone.  There was no way to activate it....no serial numbers or identifiers anywhere on the phone.  Seller refused to respond, ebay sent label to return, returned the item, now everyone claims no tracking available.  So the Seller, a thief, has the phone and my $191.01.  Going on 7 or 8 weeks since purchase and still no resolution/refund.  And if I do not receive a full refund and soon, I will NEVER again use ebay for anything."	0
"We bought 3 items from this seller for a total of $1,200 dollars. On of the items was never received (although its shown as delivered by the carrier). We disputed the case and neither the great guaranteed buyer protection from Ebay nor from Paypal covered the shortfall. So we are down $450 dollars!!! "	0
"We bought a phone, it said clean esn and then it was networked locked.  It had no battery and we could not use it at all even though it said on the description that it is ready for activation.  We asked for a refund and he offered only 40$ which is a joke to the $325.00 that we spent on a phone we were only expecting to replace the screen on.  do not buy from him for he is a cheat and a liar.  We will not buy from him anymore and I will let our corporation know not to trust or buy anything from this seller.  Buyer be very aware of buying products from this person or people."	0
We bought these cell phones because there were 3 (2 for back-up).  Cingular is our carrier and we needed phones that were compatible.  We are having problems with our current phone (probably dropped it too many times!) Cingular hasn&apos;t been around that long so we thought the phones would be a newer style.  The picture is not what you are actually buying.  The phones are ancient and in pretty rough shape.  We will take our chances with the phone we are having problems with rather than use this old cell phone from the 90&apos;s.	0
"We bought this phone after my wife's phone fell in some water, and we ended up saving over a hundred dollars by buying it on ebay. It is the exact phone in perfect condition!"	1
"We bought this phone as my wife liked her previous ones which were identical in appearance and same model #. They were easy to use.  As mentioned in previous reviews, don&apos;t drop this phone, it breaks easily at the hinge and you&apos;ll have no recourse but to shell out the money for another one. Samsung doesn&apos;t warrantee against this.  So, when my wife wanted a replacement phone, something that she was familiar with in it&apos;s operation, we bought our 3rd one.  Here&apos;s the rub:  There are apparently two generations of this same exact model(SGH-X427). The newer ones require a newer technology with the sim card and require an upgrade to your plan through AT&amp;T at higher rates, shorter off peak hours, etc. The older phones, regardless of condition, can be used with your older cards (identical in appearance)and older, existing, plans.  If the seller has a &quot;No Returns policy&quot; and there is a difference in the technology between the your previous one and the one you are buying...   Just be carefull"	0
We bought this to replace the exact same phone with sprint service but when he took it to sprint to turn it on and transfer his call list they told him that they could do what he wanted because it is a pay as it goes phone meaning he had to buy minutes to use this phone but that isn't what his service is and not what he needs so he can only use it to charge his batteries for the phone he already had but the charging port is broken so it won't charge. So it sucks to spend $20.00 to just use it for charging. 	0
"We broke a phone.  The price seemed good for the features.  For some reason, though, if you call someone without connecting from the contacts (if you just dial the number instead of clicking on their name), their name is erased from tht contacts, and their number is listed as their name. . . .hmmmmmmmmm."	0
"We decided to purchase this phone because of the good reviews that were given about it and it seemed to be at a good price.  But, the reception is awful.  It goes to analog constantly.  Many times, where we get reception with other cell phones in our family, this one has no reception. We are not happy with it at all."	0
We don't have the product anymore. I sent it back with your label you sent me. We just want our Money back. Thanks 	0
"We first purchased this phone in mid to late 2002, and have had problems with it since day one. We even purchased a second T720 approx 1 year later, hoping that it was just the first phone with issues, with nothing but problems with the second one also. The T720 is very nice in appearance(being very slim/sleek/easy to use/attractive), but the mechanical perspective of it is very poor. This model has been known to have the following problems:    *Poor Speaker/Call Quality  *Short Battery Life  *Poor Reception(regardless of any specific carrier)  *Needing ~Frequent~ Data Uploads  *VERY POOR Charging Capabilities. This type of charging plug/adapter was a Motorola experiment that proved to be very ineffective. This model has many charging problems, even with Brand New units. The ability to charge the phone after months/years of use becomes almost impossible.  *Fragile Parts/Hinges if unit is ever accidentally dropped.    We were impressed when this unit first hit the market, with all of its great features, but soon after purchasing is when all of the issues began.    All of our Cellular Phones purchased since 1989/1990 have been Motorolas, but at this point, we have decided that the Motorola brand will possibly become a brand that we will not consider. Motorola carries a good name and reputation, but after all of our experiences, we feel Cellular Phones/devices just isnt their niche.    Shop around before deciding to buy Motorola. If possible, check with other phone users regarding a particular model, or maybe even check with Forums online to see all the Rants &amp; Raves on a particular Brand or Model.    We rate Motorola CellPhones 2/5, and the Motorola T720 Model 1/5.    Good Luck on your next Cellular Phone purchase!!"	0
we got the phone but we recieved no battery... whats the deal with that??? its like paying $150 for a piece of metal and plastic &gt;.&lt;	0
we got this phone to replace old broken phones no one liked this one its hard to use and theres no valum when you call someone you can not hear them	0
We had a problem with the first phone we bought...e-bay made it good.  we  were sent a different phone....it works great...very pleased...my husband  lost his phone and wanted one just like the one he had....that&apos;s why we   turned to e-bay.....	1
We had difficulty setting the phone up with our service provider; this could have been the fault of the service provider. The phone had to be reset and in the process of downloading the battery died. Then the phone would not come on at all; it is totally dead. 	0
"We had to replace our phone and ended up getting the SGH A777 from Samsung. Very easy to use, even without a manual. Nice big numbers and easy to follow promts on the screen. Best phone we have had."	1
We have had lots of difficulty with this phone shutting itself off and the battery does not keep charge.	0
"We have loved these phones in the past and plan to continue using them.  Easy to carry around and no fear of damage from dropping or other accidents.  One even fell into my riding lawnmower while I was cutting grass, busted up the fan blade, but escaped unscathed (except for a small chip in the casing)."	1
We have not received this item yet	0
We like this phone a lot because it is easy to use and it is exactly what we wanted. We didn&apos;t want a smart phone so were pleased to find this on EBAY	1
"We lost one JUST like it and were looking for an affordable replacement. But short of the iphone, there isn&apos;t anythign close. This phone is a fabulous, fast, standard phone, especially if you don&apos;t need to use a phone as your whole world/date book/poratble pc. This phone has internet, calendar, alram, timer, calculator, plus some other neat features, and the camera is not bad at all. Takes a fairly good clear picture.    Bought this one used and it&apos;s still awesome.  Thanks!"	1
We love our new phones bought 3 of them. Like that it is water proof so my son does destroy his fishing or walking though creeks.	1
We made the mistake of not realizing that you had to buy into a specific phone plan upon purchase of this product.  So - we just didn&apos;t bother to get our $.99 back.  Later we bought the same phone from AT&amp;T (added it on to our existing plan) and are very satisfied with it.	0
"We needed a reliable 2G/3G GSM talk/text phone for a recent trip overseas.  Found a ZTE Rock F165 on ebay for a reasonable price.  Bought a prepaid SIM on the Salt (formerly Orange) network after arriving in Switzerland and the phone worked perfectly for us after installing the SIM and entering our PIN.  The phone felt good in the hand and had large enough buttons for accurate dialing and texting.  Some reviews I've seen rated it for 30 days of standby time.  I think we got about 15 days, so your 'mileage' may vary.  "	1
"we needed to replace my husbands cell phone as it had been thru the washer...literally. we picked this particular one because of the sleek, simple design. we were very happy with our choice as it is not as complicated to operate as some other cell phones we had shopped around and seen. there is really nothing i dislike about this phone and to be honest i have even thought of putting my own older cell phone thru the washer as a perfect excuse to purchase another one just like it for myself.   :)"	1
We never receieved the phone.  We paid through Pay Bid and then the seller wrote and said his roomate threw the phone out.  Right. Good thing PayBid was able to cancel payment to him.  This has made us very wary of buying on eBay.	0
"We now have three I-phone 5s&apos; in my house.  I love the size, the functionality and features of the I-phone.  Siri is awesome!  The battery seems to run down quickly, but it isn&apos;t nearly as bad as every android I had.  I was the first to make the switch and I switched every phone in my house.  Never using any other than i-phone again."	1
"We ordered our iphone on the 8th, and it's expected delivery, according to Ebay, was in 8 days. The Iphones came in 2 days, to much of our surprise. We didn't have to pay for faster shipping, it was free. This is the only time I cared to give a review for a phone-selling company. I would recommend to friends and family!"	1
We ordered this phone on the 24th of July...Shipping said delivered by 28 July to 1st of August.  Come to find out it didn't even get shipped until the 1st of August which is the expected delivery date.  Now won't be here until the 4th and my elderly customer has entertained sending it back..	0
"We purchased a phone from ebargains and not to their fault the phone didn&apos;t respond to our area. We got a hold of them and requested that if they could give a return or possibly find this specific phone we used to have that worked fine in our area. Low and behold they actually found one of those phones and quickly called us and let us know what we wanted to do. We picked the exchange of phones rather than the refund. A couple of days later they sent the phone to us boxed very nice. The phone looks brand new and we are trying it out right now as we speak. Loading info into it and hopefully get the reception we had with a phone just like it before. I thank them for going the extra mile and finding the phone that we had asked for instead of a the return hassle we would of had to go through. Also sending a return label was very nice of them also. No hassle there either. I again will do business with ebargains just because out of the many bids we won and had a situation, they were right on top of the situation RIGHT NOW, and satisfied our want&apos;s and questions without any doubt in their minds. Quickly and accurate. If any one wants to know how we were treated by ebargains, just re-read what I just wrote. Amazing! That is all I can say about this whole experience with ebargains.   lee1ray1      PS: Very honest sellers and people. My compliments to them. I also give them 100% positive feedback!!"	1
We purchased a used Sprint cell phone at the end of August.  It worked for 4 days.  We contacted the seller who asked if we would like an exchange or a refund.  We chose refund and never heard from them again!!!!  Not sure if we are interested in using ebay ever again!!!!	0
"We purchased this phone for my technically-challenged 85-year old father-in-law. He has mild dementia, so we wanted a simple phone that would be easy to operate (we tried the Jitterbug phones, but the rates get too expensive if you use it more than once in a while).    At first, it seemed to be living up to the promise of a easy-to-operate flip phone, but for the last month or two, my father-in-law had been complaining about it not holding a charge. Since he has mild dementia, we questioned whether he had actually plugged it in or not. But when we tried, the USB port was very loose. And even when we could get it to charge, the battery literally was lasting for only about 10 minutes of calls in a 5 hour morning.  Now the reason I am left to question whether this was a new phone is that my wife had this model for over 4 years before it suffered a loose port issue. And she used it for another year before the hinge broke. And a friend had one for about 8 years before he forgot he had it in his pocket and went for a swim. This phone will survive a momentary dunk, but not 30+ minutes underwater.    A ""new"" phone couldn't have gone bad that quickly, could it?"	0
"We received the iPhone in 4 days and it looked like it was in very good condition. Minor scuffs that weren't major. We had issues with it running slow and not responding with certain areas of the screen. We contacted Apple and they suggested a factory reset and then did a diagnostic. They set up an appointment to bring the phone in to be tested. When we brought the phone in, they found the phone had been dropped hard enough to damage the processor, the proximity sensor was broken, and the screen had been replaced with one that was not made by apple. The cost for repairs were $264 which was discounted by around 50% due to the insurance we have on our phone plan. Very disappointed. When we contacted Lumberjack about the problems, they suggested we return the phone for refund so it could be sold to someone else.  Very disappointed in this company. Be weary of buying anything from them because they repair broken phones with non compliant parts and the phones do not function correctly. I'd give 0 stars if I could."	0
"We received this phone in a timely manor only to find that (after bringing this phone to the Verizon store) that it had water damage and the phone would not go past the main screen when turned on. This was a lemon. Also, why send a phone wiht no charger??"	0
We recieved the phone it was fine then later we try to activate it and sprint told us we couldn&apos;t due to the original owner&apos;s non payment. I have never been able to us this phone and will never purchase another phone through ebay.	0

"We wanted to buy this phone because it was similar to the one we had had prior and it is an older model and no longer sold new.   The first thing we encountered was difficulty having it activated because it was an older model. We found out that not all older phones can even be activated. We had to take it into a Motorola store to have it reprogrammed. It did not cost anything but it was inconvenient. We found out if the prior owner owed any money on the phone, then the phone company won&apos;t activate it. The serial numbers can be checked before purchase.  Once it was activated, we noticed that it has a lot of background noise. We had not had that problem with any of the other phones we have like it that we bought new.   It was not very expensive so it is just a case of you get what you pay for. We would not buy a used phone again."	0
"We were happy for the first three weeks of use of our Nokia 521 phone.  It had quickly developed one little glitch once in a while that we at first thought was caused by inadvertent touching: the phone would suddenly show No Service.   It was acting as if it had been put into Airplane Mode, so we would go the Airplane Setting.   The setting showed, however, that is was NOT in Airplane Mode,  but we would turn ON Airplane Mode and then turn it OFF again.   Problem solved; back in service.   This happened often enough for us to suspect that this glitch was instead a defect in the phone. We are pretty sure that is, indeed, the case.  Then during the third week of use we used the headphone jack to keep a stylus attached to the phone (the stylus has a plastic jack plug designed for this use). The next day incoming calls could not be heard, even after testing several times. Use of the headphone jack had killed incoming phone sound.  It turns out that the headphone jack is very badly designed and breaks down very quickly after practically any use of the headphone jack at all. I plugged and unplugged the plastic jack in and out several times and the calls could suddenly be heard again. Thats not good enough as a solution because we want to use the phone as a music player with headphones and such use will eliminate usage of the machine as a phone by stopping hearing of incoming calls.  So; two problems: unplanned Airplane Mode and an extremely poorly designed headphone jack render this phone completely useless. Goodbye, Nokia.     https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeJd-ymPfHI"	0

"Well first of all I did get the item very quick no damage to the phone just as it was advertised but today is August 29,2008 and the device DOES NOT WORK AT ALL.I went to a retail store to replace the sims card still no good.Did more reseach the phone has a defect.So I say to all never by anything used if the seller can&apos;t be honest enough to tell you that the phone has a defect instead the seller claimed to be getting an IPhone(probably not true).So now Im out of $55.00 dollars for a broken phone and another 25.00 for a new sims card that I dind&apos;t even need.And I actually bought it b/c it had no outside damaged to the phone.Ive bought used phnoes before and never had this problem."	0
"Well Guys,after u bought this phone, i was total disappointed in NOKIA. During all this years, till current one, i was use only Nokia, starting from 3310, then 6110, then 6233. All this phones, super phones, strong, nice, all made in Hungary, Germany. But this phone, C5 ... this is a mistake of the century. First of all, made in china (Nokia and China too incompatible things) also, it doesn&apos;t seems like phone from 2011. Quality of everything its just zero (0). I not recommend to anybody to buy this phone, it doesn&apos;t cost it price, and it not a good phone for using.  That is my point."	0
"well I bought the droid because I&apos;m a high tech person, I like high tech product.My M Droid is one of the hottest phone on the market right now. What I don&apos;t like about the droid I wish it has a AMOLED SCREEM like the samsung moment and the G1. They look so shape and vibrant and the keyboard should have look like the one on the samsung moment as well, wit that say!. Now if that could just happen!. Men that would be a bad as M Droid. In the meantime I&apos;m enjoying my new M Droid and the app that come wit it. TASTMASTER"	1
"WELL I DID LIKE THE WAY THE PHONE LOOK. I BROUGHT IT CAUSE OF THE PRICE WASNT SO HIGH. WHAT I DISLIKE ABOUT THE PHONE IS THAT IT DIDNT LIVE UP TO THE AD DESCRIBING THE PHONE. IT DOESNT WORK RIGHT AT ALL AND IT WAS A WASTE OF MONEY AND I REALLY DONT RECOMMEND ANYBODY TO BUY A PHONE FROM THE SELLER, SORRY THATS JUST HOW I FEEL ABOUT THE SERVICE. THE PHONE IS JUST SITING IN THE KITCHEN CABINET COLLECTING DUST CAUSE THATS ALL ITS WORTH FOR.    ROLOVE4SWEET"	0
well i didnt get a charger and it dont have a sim card but before i got it it had all the stuff with it well it dont now and i want my charger plus my sim card thanks	0
"Well I got this phone with high hopes since most reviews were glowing!  I will not be one of those reviewers today however.    First off, windows mobile is sluggish and bloated, 6.5 makes it more sluggish but more finger friendly. Touch flow is really nice and has its uses, but I found that it just wasn&apos;t fast enough for my every day use(titanium or spb mobile shell are very good alternatives).  Software aside though, most of the touch flow problems are fixed in later builds, and windows mobile is, well, windows fault it sucks, not htc&apos;s.    Htc however built a phone with horrible battery life, sluggish performance, a useless camera, and faulty keyboard design.    Also included for your near $300 bucks is a cheap looking and feeling shiny plastic body that is finger print prone.  An near unusable 4-way button in the middle of an overall fat porker of an phone.  Buttons at the button that were not even flush or level with the rest of the body(crooked lines with a large gaping hole on one side). A camera that is so slow to update and takes the worst pictures of any phone I have owned that I don&apos;t even bother with it.     Htc placed the power button and volume buttons on the screen portion and the sliding phone which makes it feel rather flimsy when you press them in and the screen wiggles around. It doesn&apos;t inspire a lot of confidence when you hold it and see the amount of slack it has just with normal use.    Now for the main reason I bought the phone!  The really awesome keyboard that slides out!  Well scratch that, it only took 2-3 weeks before I started to get double and triple presses out of one, then it became a string of lettersssssssss. And finally it gave out and never worked again.  I tried hard resets, new roms, stock roms, I opened it and checked the cable to see if it was loose.  Nothing.  Now I have a HTC diamond with the extra girth and weight of a touch pro ;(...(oh and more ram, +1 point for that)    Just search around and you&apos;ll see frustrated people on their 5th and 6th touch pro&apos;s due to the faulty battery design that pops your keyboard cable out when the phone gets hot, which is quite often.  Granted some have had no issues whats so ever in months of their use, I just feel you should know about it before you purchase.    Now the good stuff I do enjoy about this phone.  Tons of customization available through third party software.  Great call quality and not one single dropped call since I have switched to this phone. My old nokia dropped calls all the time! The screen is gorgeous at 480x640 but a tad bit to small, however very usable even with small fonts.    With all this said, I&apos;m still tempted to buy the touch pro2, in hopes that HTC redeemed themselves with what could be the best windows mobile phone despite winmo being a bloated os.    Good luck with your purchase!"	0
Well I know it's a rehabbed phone but it creaks around the case and I think that what caused the screen to crack across the bottom the first time I put it in my pocket. I don't think they put the guerilla glass 3 in this but something cheaper. It was under a hundred though so it is what is. I had the exact same phone before this. It's meh..	0
well i like this item was because the phone was simple and basic. I loved it that because it is very durable. I hate it that this phone is not on the market anymore so only can get it from ebay used. I buy almost everything from ebay because you can get almost anything for a great price. Too bad the phone was used but still in a great condition.	1
Well I purchased this phone. However I wasn&apos;t able to use this phone due to this item is not capable with my phone provider. Due to the new gsm systems per cingular. So I am not satisfied due to the act of not being able to use this item.	0
Well i would have to turn phone off and back on whenever i wanted to send a text. I was really frustrating i was told phone worked find well it didnt and plus it would from boost service to sprint and give me an error message	0
"Well if you know Samsung's intentions, this is it"	1
"Well let&apos;s see its funny i was choosen to review this item, I have purchesed quite  q few items that were all awesome however!!!  this one i still sitting on my desk locked not because i havent called every party in voloved but because the seller was not exactly sure of what she was selling...   I gave her negative feed back then with drew it because she said the phone would work and she was gonna call for sure..... well that was a month ago............................... What a waste!!  She has done nothing else to help me since."	0
"Well over a three period I am on my 4th Samsung SGH D807. Within first week of a two year contract both my wife and my phone experienced very poor service. After many calls, AT&amp;T replaced both phones and still the same problems, dropped calls, poor receiption and breaking up. AT&amp;T then replaced both sim cards, same problem..so being under contract I have tried to correct this problem by replacing the phones one by one at my expense since AT&amp;T NOW blames the problem with my phones, but NOT the location since AT&amp;T says we are surrounded by towers and should have EXCELLENT service. So that means that all of these Samsung SGH D807 that I purchased are just hundreds of dollars of poor quality products. This may be true since my wife and I have owned Samsung cell phones,camera and a $2600.00 refrigator and all have been nothing but trouble. What I have learned about Samsung is  a VERY proprietary company, if you want service on their products as well as parts you must go to them. Read reviews on Samsung products,&quot; google it&quot; before you buy. I should have, will not make this mistake again...will never buy another Samsung product!!! Hope this helps you make a more informed purchase."	0
"Well sat on the phone, with no gaps. Very nice color"	1
"Well the best part about the phone was it was very easy ot use and navigate it. i liked the camera and recording videos.    So the problems with this phone is much more common then i knew, from day one of buying htis phone, text messages would lag behind from when they were sent and received(look this up on the internet). playing videos over the internet would always be choppy when connected to wireless, not other phone would have an issue on the same wireless, and videos are not playable on 3g or 4g.   all of this happened on the 1st photon i had. i complained to sprint to get another of the same model assuming it was a fluke.  2nd phone same thing, so i got another from ebay, and yes same thing again.  i delt with these issues by restarting the phone 2-3 times a day.  facebook/weather/app updates would not update or ever show up without a restart on all 3 phones i had.  i have tryed at least 10 other smart phones thru my work (its my job) and none have had this bad of issues.   How this thing has a good review is crazy. get a flip phone over this thing. save your time and money."	0
Well the phone is actually a great phone and it was a great Christmas Gift!  A friends wanted to surprise her son and she told me the type of phone that he wanted so I suggested that I would find one for her on ebay and so I did just that and the kid was a happy camper.	1
well the phone was in terrible condition it said used but not beat up the price was average so i never tought it would be in such bad condition .	0

So if you want to deal with an eBay seller that has great communication and excellent Customer Service buy here!    I Know I will from now on Thanks Again   Ed!!!    Edknapp	1
Well worth the price I paid for it	1
"Well, i bought this phone actually because its the best of the line. What i mean? It beats samsung galaxy S2 and these kind of smartphones.   I used lot of comparing phones webpages. The XT912 beat them all."	1
"Well, I had no idea that the phone was so old that I would not be able to use it with my current service.  I would just like people to know that before buying cell phones call your provider and check the phone you are thinking of buying to see of they can activate it.  I wasted my $$ on this, but also learned a valuable lesson."	0
"well, I never received the phone. As in many other reviews ( which I should have read before) the phone did not arrive. I received emails asking me to be more patient several times as delivery delays kept accumulating, but in the end, I decided that it was going to be pointless to wait for more. In all fairness the refund process was fairly easy, but what a waste of time. I won't order from this vendor again."	0
"well, it came with liberty firmware 1.5, and was already rooted! works like a charm. nothing to worry about, and only a few accessories needed to make it truly mine."	1
"well, lets just say if you spend almost $100 on a phone, the screen shouldn't crack because it's sat down on a soft surface..i can understand if its dropped or slammed but...not just placed down so frustrating..  and the ""warranty carrier"" say's you pay them they will fix it that's a joke!"	0
"Well, that phone could be good. Great specs for little money, good battery, waterproof, design, dock included, ok camera. It is a bit quiet, but it is acceptable for waterproof phone.  But the one thing that ruins everything - is display! Awful. Viewing angles are TN-Film like, much worse than IPS. Like on the cheap 20$ phones. But it is not the main problem! Display is flickering. It is not defect - it is stupid 1st generation IGZO from sharp. On grey colour you will see how the picture is pulsing and flickering (also on other colours, but grey is especially bad). Flickering is very clearly visible when you use mobile data and internet. Yes, everything is THAT bad. There is no other phone that flickers like that. Most people will think that it is defective, probably. But in such a way display saves battery. Well, old CG-Cilicon from Sharp was miles ahead of that crap. For me - it makes this phone unusable for browsing the web, watching something via wifi. It is good only for calling. I know that this phone is from 2012, but Galaxy S3 was from that year also and has much better screen."	0
"Well, The phone seems ok but the battery will not hold a charge. So I had to buy a new battery. Hopefully, a new battery will work.    Bernard"	0
"well, what can I say? ebay has made my shopping so easy and simple. You owes find what you&apos;re looking for at a reasonable price. I got my Nokia Lumia 920 which am currently using and thanks to you guys at ebay.To y&apos;all guys out thre I guarantee you the best at eBay."	0
Wen selling a used item should let custumer know it was very dirty around the screen and scratch 	0
"Went dead a month ago, found out the chipset has an issue...Bummer.  Otherwise, I loved the phone itself."	0
Went from a neutral bad feeling to a great great feeling from the customer satisfaction thoughts. My Seller made good at unlocking the locked but listed as unlocked used phone.  It will make my mother in law happy in Africa. Thanks again	1
Went from Verizon smartphone to this.  I would recommend this item for not only the value but for the features.	1
"Went to Metro PCS for advation,after, one hour the phone stop working, took it back, to Metro and had the same,problem, after leaving the store.The phone is no good period.I would like to return it. and receive a refund, thank you."	0
went to the lx600 because of what it can do compared to the elite.It lets me go into quest picture were the elite will not.I just fine with what i have.	1

What a dick . Instead of contacting me if there were any shipping issues . He literally cancels the order !! Irresponsible and not professional at all.	0
What a great value. I am not a get the latest consumer. A year old brand new phone for the money is awesome for me. I am very satisfied with this product and the fast shipping. I will by my next phone from them.	1
what a peice of shit!!! they said it was a good phone but its not at all what i thought. very slow very bad phone	0
"What a terrible disappointment. Right out of the box, this phone was nothing but trouble. No matter what program I was using, the menu constantly pops up and down, inexplicably, making it impossible to use properly. After a web search, I discovered this is a known hardware issue; referred to as the &quot;Galaxy S2 phantom menu&quot;. Samsung is apparently well aware of this issue, yet they still allow this phone to be sold to unwitting consumers. Fortunately, I was able to return it to the vendor for a full refund. Don&apos;t waste your time with this phone!"	0
What brand of SIM card do I buy for this phone ? I inserted my Boost Mobile SIM but I can&apos;t make any calls . I also inserted a 4g memory card but can&apos;t surf the web. I can&apos;t find anything on the specs for this phone I&apos;ve had it for a month now and still haven&apos;t been able to use it	0
What can i say about this purchase. Battery has full charge and dies in less then an hour. Number keys do not work on the keyboard. I guess you get what you pay for.	0
"What can I say... other than I like it very much. It is so convenient to have multiple desk-tops and it is really easy and comfortable to use, it suits me perfectly and is very affordable. I tend to accidently throw it into camera mode because of my clumsy fingers disturbing the lense cover but that is something I can live with.Some of the catalogued applications won&apos;t download but that is probably due to my ignorance. I&apos;ve very quickly mastered all the basic functions and now I am enjoying playing with the other interesting aspects of this fantastic pocket computer."	1
what carrier is this phone 	0
"What do I like, love, or dislike about it (I guess Ebay is refering to an Apple iphone 3GS White (16GB) (Unlocked)? Impossible to answer since I have never even seen a picture, or read a description, of the forementioned product. However, my wife has had several long discussions on our old fashioned telephone with Ebay representatives, exchanged numerous emails with said Ebay representatives. The brain trust at Ebay and my wife have concluded (I thought to everyones satisfaction) that we neither my wife or myself) have ever placed an order of the Apple iphone 3GS White (16GB) (Unlocked). I guess the reader of this review gets the idea by now, . . . I never purchased one. If you the reader did, congradulations."	0
What do you think of this product? very good! Write a review to help your fellow eBay members decide which product to purchase.	1
WHAT ELSE CAN I SAY. AWESOME PHONE AND AWESOME SELLER THANKS.	1
"what I did not like was The first phone did not work, The guy sent .a new battery.Still did not work, Than was sent 2 others phone and they dont work. been trying to get the guy to respond to my e mails and would like my money back and he has seemed to forget about me.  So all in all I would say in the end I dislike this alot."	0
What I like about the Sharp TM 150 phone I like that it was big and I always wanted the phone but t-mobile stop making it.What I don&apos;t like about the phone is when I first recevie the phone it wouldn&apos;t charge so I sent it back for another one. The seller sent me a second phone which was working for a week but stop charging and now I have a phone that doesn&apos;t work which I paid $55.00.The reason why I decide to buy this iteam because I needed a new phone from t-mobile and the store t-mobile was charging to much.	0
"What I love about this phone is that it really is a smart phone, I don&apos;t worry if I am not at home, office or not carrying a laptop when when I am out and about; this phone allows me to answer my email, organize my calendar and down load attachment to view from emails.  I simply just love this phone. It lets me email and text so easily and fast...not like with my other phone in which I had to change from text to number... that way takes too long sometimes.  This is a GREAT phone to own! I am so glad decide to purchase it!!!!"	1
What I ordered for is not what I got . I received a very old and withered phone in the mail .. I regrete it ever buying it .. Plz b Honest with ur posts dnt go downloading pictures of brand new phones that u dnt have deceiving people to order expecting to receive something clean only to be disappointed at the end .. Shame on u .. Shame on u .. I pity for who so ever looking at your item . I regard this a scam .. Fraud and deceipt of the first order . Am pissed off that I destroyed the phone immediately as I got it .. Hope there&apos;s a way to recoup my money I will not hasitate . And I will continue writing negative feedback on ur ads until u so something about my loss ... Pl	0
"What is good?  -Slim and luxury design  -High quality built  -Wide (big) screen  -Great resolution    What is bad?  -No expendable memory    Let me start off with design of the phone. This phone is ONLY 14.9 mm thin. Phone is just about right size to hold in your hand. Even in a pocket you wont feel uncomfortable. Many of the phones Ive through, I have some what discomfort when phone is in a pants pocket. In addition, the chrome molding around the phone is beautifully done.    I also have Samsung D600 and a feature wise, Samsung D600 is somewhat more powerful but not much. D800 performs almost identical features as D600.  D600 has 2.0mp and document viewer which D800 does not have. A 1.3 mp camera takes really good photos and videos.     However, I like the D800 due to the elegant design and the great resolution also the big screen format. I can view EBay web page just like I view it on the computer. Of course you have to move around to see the page. But it is far better then other phones.    Here I will list some of the specs of the phone to take a quick scoop.    Network: Tri-Band GSM 900, 1800, 1900  Size: 97L x 52W x 14.9H mm  Display: 256K colors; 240 x 320 pixels  Ring tone: Mp3 and Polyphonic (64chan)  Memory:  80 MB total; 4 MB for Java applications  Data: GPRS; EDGE; Bluetooth    In conclusion, I feel comfortable recommend this phone.    Hope this review is helpful.  Thank you for spending time reading my review."	1
What it says Verizon on the telephone and it's unlocked and you hook it to AT&T you don't get 4G LTE you get H and maybe H+and you have all the Verizon stuff on the phone when they turn it on I sent it back the very next day for a refund cost me $15 for restocking fee and another $7 to print a label now I'm back to using the same phone I had Moto X 2nd generation with 4G and it runs from the computer with no problem whatsoever just wish it had more battery life.	0
"What more can be said? Its a great phone! The ONLY con to it is the video on it is quite sketchy and laggy but the rest is amazing! If you&apos;re thinking about buying it, do it.    Hunter"	1
"what the iphone looks like is a fake iphone because there is no imei number on the box,  the box is a fake iphone xs max box, so the iphone is also a fake iphone"	0
What you get from the phone and software in comparison to the cost is the best i could find. If you are now using one of the other two platforms (which i was) switch!! everything is seamless between devices and easy to use.	1
"What&apos;s nice:   1. flat streamline styling making it attractive and very easy and comfortable to carry in a pocket or purse.  2. screen size... larger than what I&apos;m used to, well lit and very easy to read.  3. excellent sound volume range.   3. lovely color (scarlet).   4. loads of capabilities and options... more than I&apos;ll ever use.     What&apos;s disappointing:  1. battery seems to drain way too quickly.   I usually go days without using my phone and the infrequent times that I do use it (maybe twice a week)... the battery charge shows about a 15% or more charge loss.  2. sound quality is lacking in clarity. voices sound muffled for both incoming and outgoing conversations.  3. connector for charger is exposed... I would have preferred that it had a protective cover similar to the one that&apos;s over the memory card slot.  4. backlight on on display screen cuts out too soon (20 seconds if you don&apos;t push a button). and, there&apos;s no setting to keep the light on longer... but, then maybe it&apos;s a built in way to conserve on a battery that already doesn&apos;t hold a good charge.     I got mine free with a 2 year contract extension and rebate; so, I&apos;m not out any money. But, I wouldn&apos;t pay full or even half price for this phone. And, I&apos;ll definitely be replacing this when my contract expires in 2 years... maybe, sooner if the battery doesn&apos;t hold up."	0
"When  I got my phone, I didn't activate it for about 3 weeks. By the time I did, I realized it had a permanent, undisclosed 'smudge"" on the screen (making texts hard to read. Also, the volume button on the side of the phone did not work. I have to go in to ""settings"" to adjust the volume. Because it was past the date when returns were allowed, I was out of luck."	0
"When browsing Fbooks, the screen  turns off."	0
When contacting my service provider I was told this phone would only work with the Alltell company which apparently is no longer in existence.  So the phone is obsolete. But the charger and battery are great and I was able to use them to get my old phone to work.	0
When he got fortnite the game would kick him back to the main lobby when he jumped out of the battle bus.	0
"when i accept my phone,i found damaged top button on the surface of cell. phone.  i have a difficulty to open the rear panel for change a sim card.  2 weeks ago i send   my phone to the seller,now i waiting to the new one."	0
"When i ask this seller about condition he told me that this phone is like new and has no issues,no lcd burn.when i get my product i check everything and found some problems. 1.phone has lcd burn it was little but its a problem 2.1 of 2 loutspeakers doesn't working 3.phone is very hot after 5-10 minutes of working 4.battery life is not so bad but not so good Seller don't make a partial refund and dont want pay for postal service from my country."	0
when i bid on this i was looking for a fliptop phone but this was nice looking and had a camera which i definitely needed for 2 girls that change every day but i won it and i paid it right away because that is good business procedures-right away the seller wrote me saying it would be going out soon and which it did the seller shipped right away and then the mailman brought it to the door and it was so light when i took it out but it was a good description of what the phone was supposed to look like and no scratches or anything wrong with it- it charged right away and i love it the phone is so easy to use and i love taking pictures of the girls with it and it is so light its not one of those big bulky phones and it is a great phone for anyone and comes with everything you would want for it.	1
when i bought my lg g3 i was told it was in very good condition and is reliable but after having it for a few days it got blocked due to not being payed off and i can not use the phone 	0
"When I bought the Motorola V66, I bought it like the seller said, with a FEW MINOR scratches, and &quot;Unlocked&quot;. But What did I get, a phone so majorily scratched up, that I had to put back in its box, and leave it on my old book case. And it wasn&apos;t even unlocked. The only reason I wrote a good feedback was because he was like sending me so many &quot;reminders&quot; to put a good feedback before it even arrived, so I thought what the heck, the picture of the phone looked good, so that&apos;s why I left a good feedback, before even recieving it. But then later I find out that it was just a &quot;stock photo&quot;. I highly don&apos;t recommend this person."	0
When I bought the phone I like it and used it for a few weeks until it completely died.  I took it to a Cingular store and they advised me to discard it which I did because it was just too old.  I went to another store who gave me a different phone which I hope lasts until my regular contract expires later this year.	0
when I bought the product I was very pleased because for the conditions presented were actually very good for the price I paid for it	1
"When I bought this phone I loved it. It was small, compact, (motorola razr size) and very easy to use. I loved the fact that it has subfolders for almost all the files and that it&apos;s very quick at sending texts, as well as going into the next menu. The buttons are smooth and the design is pretty cool overall."	1
"When I bought this smartphone, it was declared as ""never unused."" However, this phone was used and with big scratches. Photo attached below."	0
"When I contacted this seller, jbnorris276, about the conflicting description (TMobile) vs. listing (Verizon)his only reply was ""READ THE DESCRIPTION"" as if there was no ambiguity.  Lost business on this one."	0
When I first got the phone I said oh wow it looks so nice but I realize it did not have it SD card for it and When i used it it did not work properly Noone  good hear me on the phone when I call them so I returned it	0
When I first got this phone it was great. this was my first touchscreen phone so I was a little nervous. My main issue with this phone is the delay. It has a horrible lag and every time I restart my phone or the battery dies upon turning it back on it resends old text messages to people and keeps doing it even when I try to make it stop.  The pictures on my phone always disappear or I get an error message when I try to view them. This phone is always getting me frustrated.	0
"When I first purchased this phone it worked fine, shortly afterward, it began cutting off and saying there was no SIM card after charging.  I thought it was the SIM card but found out the SIM card was working just fine, it was the phone that was defective and the seller refused to give me a refund or exchange it for another phone!  I am very disappointed and will never buy another phone from E-Bay again!"	0
"When I first received the phone, the battery was bad and did not hold the charge. Later on I found out that the phone sensitivity was very poor. I returned it as it was not acceptable to use as is. This ordeal cost me $15 in shipping fees and I feel that I have been robbed because this was a defective phone. I now own a Motorola V195a. This phone is truly a marvel and far exceeds my expectations. The features, the audio quality and sensitivity are excellent!"	0
When i firsty laid my eyes open it it semeed to cute to be real yet after examining it. Yes it was true a true beauty to behold.	1
when i got it.. the phone was all nasty and grimy..    also performance wize it was not real good... so ild rate this a verry poor phone    or atleat below average.. no wonder they never had pictures of it on ebay....	0
When I got the phone I had to read hear the screen cuz it was cracked now the phone has been going black so the seller told me to not return it and they were going to refund me I threw the phone out and now they're arguing with me and not want to give me my refund do not buy this phone it is the worst phone in history I'm warning you	0
"when I got the phone, I like it. but after using 2-3days. it was really poor. it was like used phone. I try to delete the picutre. it was always auto turn off. bad"	0
"When i got this phone HTC 10  the first time it was a complete mess, nothing worked in it  and i even lost my sim card in it and had to get a new card. Contacting the company was a pain and sending the phone back was a nightmare. it took forever to receive the first time and took even longer to get the replacement. Once i did get the replacement new  phone it has been amazing and i love the phone. Hopefully you don't get the same situation as mine. In the end it was worth it for the price. "	0
when I insert the sim card it is as if I had reported as stolen it does not show a signal.	0
"when I order this phone I have the idea that I was going to get a NEW PHONE and for my surprise I get something shipping in an envelope wrapped buy towel papers no box , no book of instruction , the charging cord was for SAMSUN , no unlock pin for the memory card in total the phone is a mess, lots of acessorys  are missing ."	0
When I owned iphone I forgot all other brands . So amazing mobile phone .  Great when you touch the screen . The screen is big &amp; clear .The wieght &amp; shape are good . The OS enviroment Really fantastic &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;	1
When i purchased that phone galaxy j3 the seller didn't show everything i read the descriptions he didn't not put all the descriptions the phone galaxy j3 have too many scratches on it  it's too expensive for that price	0
"When I purchased this phone on eBay, even though I read not so good reviews from other website I still hope that the quality isn&apos;t that bad because it was froma US seller and Dell is the brand and besides I plan to make it as a birthday gift to a friend. After my friend&apos;s birthday it was returned to me because the phone keeps on restarting over and over, like a loop but never shows the menu screen. I contacted the seller and advise that I need to return it back to them. I found out too, that it was made in China but shipped by a US seller and the seller message me that all phones are made in China nowadays. Returning it back is not a pain, but what really makes me feel bad was the shame by giving a gift that is not working.. The phone is still on me, I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s worth the effort to return it or simply toss it in the bin."	0
"When I read the information on this phone, it specifically stated that there was free shipping. When I won the item, I received an invoice stating that the total also included S&amp;H...WHAT???!!! Unless this seller responds to what happened, I am refusing to purchase this item solely based on the fact that it was false advertisement."	0
When I receive my phone my phone was slightly cracked didn't notice it then because I put a protective case on the back of it when I got it activated I noticed the crack then started growing until eventually grew bigger and bigger maybe the heat had something to do with it I don't know I had it several days I had it in a case can you help me get another phone	0
"When I received it and opened the box , the back was missing . I would like to return it please contact me "	1
When I received my iPhone it was dead without a charger!	0
"when i received the iphone in the mail, the entire screen was lifting up off of the phone and you could see light coming out of the sides. i went to see if i could get it fixed and when they opened the phone to put a new screen on, they found a plastic sheet that was left inside of the phone on the inside of the screen. there was also glue where there needed to be screws. they were able to fix it and i was able to use the phone for a couple of weeks until last night when the screen went completely black and will not turn back on."	0
"When I received the package it was empty and had been stamped by the post office &quot;Package Received Empty&quot;.  When I contacted the seller she was unwilling to refund my money.  I contacted Ebay and receieved no help from them either, so I am now out $110.00 and still have no phone!"	0
"When I received the phone I was so happy, then I came to the point where you have to connect to your internet... So, It wouldn't connect to my Internet. What ever you do, stay away from this scammer!"	0
"When I received the phone it did not work,I charged it up but it won&apos;t come on.after emailing back and forth the best I can do is ship it back and be out the cost of shipping and time!!!"	0
"When I received the phone it immediately started to randomly reboot.  These random reboots were not disclosed on the ebay listing.  After multiple troubleshooting attempts over a couple of weeks, based on google searches of thevproblem, with no results,  it eventually would not even turn on.  When I brought the phone to a repair shop they stated it was not repairable. So, in essence I was sold a lemon."	0
"When i received the phone, it was in almost perfect condition. it looked brand new! however, when i install my TMOBILE SIM CARD, and started it up, it wouldn&apos;t accept my sim. i opened the cover and removed battery and sim card to find that one of the sim pins on the phone were damaged, therefore not functioning properly which was described in the auction. i feel like i have wasted my time looking and waiting and bidding for this phone. such a big dissapointment... when i contacted the seller about it, they just said they appreciate my business and want 5 star feedback.... what great customer service..... thanks for wasting my time... im never bidding on any of the items from this seller again."	0
When I received this phone it was in new condition as stated and in its original packaging. Maybe I am used to the newest and latest phones because I found it VERY SLOW to operate and it froze up often requiring a restart.   	0
"when i recive the phobe it was not unlocked how they said , but i send some emails and they call me , but i still dont recive the unlock code to unlocked the phone,  now i have the phone and i have ti paid 13 dollars extra for something that must not be my problem because i paid for a unlocked phone   i hope some body can help me"	0
When I saw the phone for sale I was a little skeptical about my purchase. Diving into it anyways I got exactly what I ordered plus it came a day ahead of schedule. An additional 10 bucks later I was able to fix the problem and get the phone up and running. The seller was also very polite in responding back to my questions. I'll definitely be buying more from eBay and more from this seller. 	1
"When I took this Sprint phone in to Sprint to have it activated to my Sprint account, Sprint sales personnel and Sprint technicians could not get my Sprint device to connect to the Sprint network.  After about 3 hours of troubleshooting, Sprint has sent my Sprint device out to be looked at by more knowledgeable Sprint techs, and if they cannot resolve the issue, Sprint has promised provide me with a replacement free of charge.  If, for some reason, Sprint cannot repair or replace this device, I will be returning it for a refund. "	0
"when i tried to activate this phone sprint said the phone was an insurance claim and was stolen or a lost phone so it cant be activated,if the numbers are bad you cant activate the unit,"	0
"When I turn on the phone, the SAMSUNG logo starts rolling and then the image on the screen never stops. "	0
"When I was looking for a cellphone I was going to buy the Samsung Galaxy S3 at the time, but the salesman convinced me that this one was better because it had a better LTE coverage. Boy! have I regreted that decision for the following reasons:    1) I had to pay $50 bucks. Galaxy was free.    2) It&apos;s buggy, It crashes all the time, many times by itself. (I can just hear the phone rebooting from within my pocket)    3) Wi-Fi is buggy. I have to restart the application/phone sometimes just to continue browising the internet, and of course while I do that, the Data-network kicks in downloading whatever it is I was trying to view. Effectively defeating the purpose of usign wi-fi.    4) screen shatters EASILY.    5)My network DATA connection only works half the time (I&apos;m NOT exagerating)    6) Its typing is slow and cluncky. I&apos;m no fan of the iphone but the HTC Raider is not user friendly at all. Sometimes if you click outside of the keyboard area it will kick you out of it and browse to the first message you have saved of whoever your writing to. Leaving you with 1 of 2 choices. A) exit and go back to it as a draft, or B) scroll down your saved messages, all the way to the message you are writing. Hopefully you set it up for ie: 50 messages, because otherwise you will be scrolling through hundreds and hundreds of old messages... you get my point.    7) Deleting apps is haard as f$%^. You have to go into &apos;applications&apos; then go to &apos;delete applications&apos; then you have to look for the application through pages of apps because they are not organized or categorized separately. Just all meshed together, and of course sometimes this won&apos;t delete your application after all that. Confused? you can imagine my frustration.    8) Cannot delete apps that come with the phone, ie: twitter. You have to hardwire it to the computer and delete from there. Do you have time for that? Neither do i.    9) After the last update, the battery lasts less than 2 hours. I had to download an app called &quot;juice saver&quot; to help me get back to regular hours. For some reason the new update makes your connection be on ALL the time. so not sure why they did that but it drains your battery.       All in all, annoying to navigate and operate. VERY buggy. cheaply made and not worth it. Also, they costumer service was less than helpful and they send you in loops. nice... Save your money and go get yourself a Samsung Galaxy, you wont be sorry."	0
when I went to active it the sprint store told me it is a stolent phone can&apos;t connect..ebay should allow buyers to buy with money orders I don&apos;t agree this  sellers should get paid in credit card!!!!!	0
When I won he txted me and said sorry man can't send it to you which is funny because I live in the state next to him and his reasoning was I did not pay within 2 minutes of the win. Don't buy it's a scammer 	0
When in doubt iphone out!! Fast shipping great deal!!	1
"When it comes to Smart Phones their is nothing better than a Windows Phone. They are easy to use, make sense, and built to get things done. This phone works so well. The battery is not as good as I would like, but apart from that it is perfect. "	1
"When my previous LG8700 was damaged, I ordered the same phone (used), and I&apos;ve been very happy with it. It&apos;s very sturdy, easy to use, I like the size, and it has all the features of a basic phone that I need. I love it!"	1
when phone arrived it was a I phone 4 and did not work I am not a happy camper	0
"When the nexus one came out a couple years ago it was the top dog in the market. For a phone thats over 2 years old, it is still a great phone to have. Ever since the nexus one came out i ALWAYS wanted one. I finally got one this year and boy did it live up to my expectation. In my opinion, the nexus one is the original Android phone, you don&apos;t get all the crap software and apps that cell phone company&apos;s load onto their phones, its your basic android handheld. I owned this phone for 6 months but had to give it up because i had to switch to verizon, but i still love this phone. Google made this phone right, if you buy it you won&apos;t be disappointed. Probably the best phone for the money on the market."	1
"When the phone was received it was broken and didn&apos;t charge.  The phone was returned to the company for a refund, they still held the $10 handling fee even though this product didn&apos;t work from when it was received.  Not only did I have to pay the handling fee, but also had to paying the shipping fees to return the phone to the company.  A customer should not have to pay any fees when a product is broken or doesn&apos;t work the way a company states it will work when received, we don&apos;t go to a store a pay handling fees, when a product is returned, so why should we when a product is brought on line.  I do not recommend this company to purchase a phone."	0
"When this phone came out it was almost a thousand bucks. It didn't sell as well as they hoped because of the unique design, so the price eventually dropped insanely. Truth is, this is still a great phone. If you want a large screen and long battery life, this phone still delivers... I bought one originally from this same seller for $200 I believe it was an open box return. Flawless... Two years later I am replacing it because I punished it, never used a case, dropped it, got it wet, and it held up, but now it looks pretty beat up, although the screen is very much still in tact and the phone works fine, I figured I would look into an upgrade... Then I saw that refurbished were available for only 99 bucks! screw it I ordered another.. The box was a little scuffed but the phone was prestine, and the chords were still wrapped in the original plastic. Great phone if you know what you're getting and a great seller. 100% trust at this point."	1
"When this product arrived, it was obvious it was not ""new & sealed"". The box fell apart. The phone only worked on the Sprint network. It had been used before and re-sealed. It wasn't new OR factory unlocked. To top it all off, they included an  iPhone charger and a wall plug made specifically to fit outlets in China. Never buy from this seller. I'm done with eBay all together they screen nothing and no one. "	0
when we got the phone she didnt turn the phone off un der her name it cost us a nother 10.00 to do this which i think she should pay for it. it was her phone and done everything to it before she sold it robin.	0
"When we purchased a phone from this seller, he had a deal that if you left feedback BEFORE flashing the phone, he&apos;d flash the phone for you for FREE. Huge bold print about the generous deal, so we left positive feedback because the item came looking brand new and was shipped quickly. After the phone was flashed however, we experienced problems IMMEDIATELY. The phone never functioned correctly and the Motorola emblem on the back fell off the next day for no reason at all. Contact between us and the seller was extremely poor. We felt sure we were being given the run around in hopes that the 30 day exchange policy would expire. Also, we&apos;d already given positive feedback, so how we were treated by the seller really didn&apos;t matter, no one on Ebay would know. We had to open a case with Ebay in order for the seller to respond to our problems with his faulty product. At that point he responded quicker than ever, assumably because he was looking out for himself and his Ebay account, NOT US, the consumer.  I strongly recommend that you FULLY EXPLORE your item and ensure proper function before leaving positive feedback for this seller. I&apos;m wondering how many positive feedbacks were given before consumers found that they would NOT have left positive feedback had they not been inticed to leave it before fully exploring any items bought from this seller.    So here&apos;s my ammended feedback:    NEGATIVE: would not recommend, item not as described, poor communication, had to open Ebay case."	0
When we received the phone it was still active under someone else's account. We had to mail it back and are still waiting on the refund. 	0
when you can buy a good product for a very low price you don&apos;t have to worry about it if it gets damaged. what is really nice about buying a good used phone is that you don&apos;t have to enter into a new contract with the carrier.	1
"When you have the Motorola V635 in your hand you know it. It is a substantial handset. It tips the scales at 134 grams, or almost 4.7 ounces. With a metal battery cover and metal front flip cover it feels solid because it is solid. The phone is not large. It is only marginally larger than the Motorola V188. It will fit nicely into cases used with a Nokia 6103 or 6131 as well as many similar form factor Motorola models. It is a sturdy, well built physical specimen.     It&apos;s tank-like build in no way hinders it performance. The V635 scrolls through menus quickly. The tactile feedback from the keypad is crisp and distinct. The keypad a is a bit more slick than some. It is in no way difficult to use as a result of this texture choice by Motorola. In contrast the non-numeric keys have a rough texture that makes for a nice touch. The Voice key on the side of the handset activates a bit too easily. It seems everytime I pick up the handset it wants to voice dial.     The true measure of a mobile handset is the ability to pick up and hold signals coupled with the quality of the speaker and microphone. It is here that the V635 really shines. It finds the signal in fringe areas and it holds on tenaciously. The speaker is loud and quite clear, about the clearest, most natural sound I&apos;ve heard from a mobile handset. The microphone also produces a very clear and natural sound for the person at the other end.     In addition to telephone basics this handset has Bluetooth, an MP3 player, Internet browser, IM, E-mail, Java and the ability to handle up to a 2 gigabyte microSD card. This phone has a lot going for it. The MotoMixer is a fun way to produce new ringtones based upon the included pre-set MIDI patterns. It has voice notes and voice dialling. A calendar, calculator, datebook, alarm clock, two games and currency converter round out the software goodies.     The camera has 1.2 megapixels with zoom and video capability. It has supplementary illumination for dark scenes. The handset menu refers to it as a flash but actually it is a constant illumination rather than a flash.     That it is also is one of the nicest looking flip phones around doesn&apos;t hurt it either. This is one handset that doesn&apos;t have to show its age. The black center piece is easily removed and replaced with a new one. The front cover and battery door are also easily and cheaply available. For less than the price of a nice lunch a person can renew the entire outside of the handset and never touch a tool. It&apos;s not that these are prone to scrapes and damage but if your phone starts to look a little ragged you can spruce it up and keep on going.     Many extras, solid basic performance and few weak areas make the V635 an ideal handset. Most of the units you find on eBay are unlocked, they work with any GSM carrier that operates on 850/900/1800/1900 bands because this is a quadband model. That means it will work in North America, South America as well as on the continent and in the UK."	1
When you try to buy it they cancel the action 	0
when you use the speaker on calls it echos and gives feed back. other times the phone just does not work at all.	0
"Whenever I first was researching cell phones to buy several years back (2010) I fell in love with this phone -- however it was pretty expensive at the time (something like $400?), plus I didn't live in a place with reliable cell signal so I put it out of my mind -- Until the beginning of this past October, when I decided to look into it again.   The price was amazing ($60.00~!!!) Tho it seems that price only applied to the orange ones and the blue was $40.00 more)). Shipping was stellar -- took less than a week! The case for it was only a couple dollars and also arrived promptly on time.  The Motorola Flipout is super tiny, has a touch screen AND keyboard -- both which make texting so much easier, (I have such a hard time typing on touch screens). It's unique swivel-flip design makes it easy to end phone calls; when you're done talking, just flip it shut and it hangs up -- so much more satisfying than just pressing ""END"" on more updated touch screen only smartphones.  I don't use a data package, and the fact that I could keep my $30 unlimited talk and text plan from AT&T since the phone is unlocked made the switch from my old phone really easy. The Motorola Flipout does have a larger sim card than the default sim cards that come with most phones now -- but when I went into my loc"	1
"Where is my phone ,,you guys are such liars. Sucks."	0
where to start? Fist off it doesnt take an sd card and its an mp3 phone what is that? it doesnt have video. the camera is blurry. It is horrible to text on. and it is so thin you cant talk on it w/o holding it. I would say only buy it if you find it so cheap and cant find ne better phone and you want to find a usb to put your music on it.	0
"Whether knowingly or not, the seller sold me a cloned Samsung Galaxy S9+. They then told me that the phone worked fine and would not give me a refund. Below, I inserted pictures of the ""About Phone"" section and the build number. Google the build number and the first search is that it is a clone. I am not happy. "	0
"While everyone else was busy trying to keep up with iPhone, Apple were busy creating amazing new features that make iPhone more powerful, easier to use, and more indispensable than ever. The result is iPhone 4. The biggest thing to happen to iPhone since iPhone. All the breakthrough technology in iPhone 4 is situated between two glossy panels of aluminosilicate glass - the same type of glass used in the windshields of helicopters and high-speed trains. Chemically strengthened to be 20 times stiffer and 30 times harder than plastic, the glass is ultradurable and more scratch resistant than ever. It&apos;s also recyclable. The 960-by-640 backlit LCD display boasts a pixel density of 326 pixels per inch, making it the highest-resolution phone screen ever. To achieve this, Apple engineers developed pixels so small - a mere 78 micrometers across - that the human eye can&apos;t distinguish individual pixels. That makes text remarkably sharp and graphics incredibly vivid. IPS technology also provides excellent color and contrast from almost any viewing angle. Created from Apple&apos;s own alloy, then forged to be five times stronger than standard steel, the CNC-machined band is the mounting point for all the components of iPhone 4. The band provides impressive structural rigidity and allows for its incredibly thin, refined design. It also functions as both iPhone 4 antennas. Apple engineers designed the A4 chip to be a remarkably powerful yet remarkably power-efficient mobile processor. With it, iPhone 4 can easily perform complex jobs such as multitasking, editing video, and placing FaceTime calls. All while maximizing battery life. iPhone 4 includes a built-in three-axis gyroscope. When paired with the accelerometer, it makes iPhone 4 capable of advanced motion sensing such as user acceleration, full 3D attitude, and rotation rate. Translation: More motion gestures and greater precision for an even better gaming experience. The iPhone 4 camera shoots gorgeous 5-megapixel photos and stunning HD video. And with its advanced backside illumination sensor, it captures beautiful images even in low-light settings. The built-in LED flash does double duty. When you&apos;re taking pictures, it works as a flash. When you&apos;re shooting video it can stay on to light up the scene. And on the front of iPhone 4, the built-in camera is perfect for making FaceTime calls and shooting self-portraits. While most phones have only one microphone, iPhone 4 has two. The main mic, located on the bottom next to the dock connector, is for phone calls, voice commands, and memos. The second mic, built into the top near the headphone jack, is for FaceTime calls and for making your phone calls better. It works with the main mic to suppress unwanted and distracting background sounds, such as music and loud conversations. This dual-mic noise suppression helps make every conversation a quiet one. With its large Multi-Touch display and innovative software, iPhone lets you control everything using just your fingers. How does it work? A panel laminated on the glass senses your touch using electrical fields. It can register multiple touches at once to support advanced gestures such as pinch to zoom, two-finger tap, and more. The panel then transmits the information to the Retina display below it."	1
"While I had to give up AT&T when they stopped talking to less than 4G devices like this, but I STILL needed to have a Palm Pilot on my belt for some Apps that that didn't quite make the transition to iOS or Android. This one fits the bill."	1
"While it looks great, the fit,form, and function is not good. It runs extremely hot, would not operate on my wifi network and was having issues while on an app- you could not hang up after a call was over- you had to actually turn the phone off to hang up.. Not a happy Amazon phone customer..."	0
While purchasing the comments has been said there are no issues with the Phone but the battery had issue. It took 2 hours to charge from 80% to 100%. There is no return facility also and i had personally spent 84 dollars to repair and get the new battery.	0
"While the phone is fine, I did NOT realize that we would have to buy a data package for this phone.  Worse than that, Verizon will not allow the Kin to have a lower level data package (which is allowed on most other smartphones). I have spent hours on the phone with Verizon trying to get a lower data package and they simply wont allow it. No viable reason. A total rip off."	0
"While the phone works it has a battery that a dead cell, therefore it does not hold a charge. Additionally the back cover has been damaged so that it doesn&apos;t completely close."	0
"While the seller was wonderful, the phone is awful.    I bought it because the features it had.    It locks up &amp; needs to be re-booted often, the screen is poorly responsive, reception is spotty at best (I live near the dang tower)    The camera drains the battery nearly instantly, and the phone HEATS up while the camera is on. (could be use as a pocket warmer)    Applications wont fully close &amp; need to be closed via the task manager or the battery drains within a couple hours    The seller sent me a new phone and it is the same as the first, terrible.    I would rather use the old Motorola flip phone than this one."	0
While this phone is indeed unlocked the ATT bloat ware is very intrusive. Can not use the tmobile WiFi calling as ATT has this locked to thir service only. I would recommend only using these when or if a working root becomes available for anything other than ATT	0
Who do you think is gonna pay that much?? 	0
Who sells items that aren't in stock?  And it took 2 business days to figure that out? I have to assume it's the same kind of seller that would forget to ship purchases.  At least I did get a refund with the sorry we're an unorganized mess message!	0
Whoever owned this phone didn't cancel their account and the phone is unusable. I wish I had of know this before hand. What a scam!	0
Why did Gnodsales refuse to sell this phone at the high bid of $350.   My bid was $345. Then he reposted it. Is this about greed ? I was denied.	0

"Why i bought this item: it was at a very good price, so just say it was a bargain also i loved the item as the phone had been sold and made me a profit, what iliked was even though it was priced well it stil had 1 part faulty the charging, but hey thats lif and what you get is what you recieve in the auction lolz but then again think about it i made a rofit why cant you!    Make sure when purchasing from ebay you ha the right mind and read the full auction before placin a bid as you may pick up or get somthing that you didnt want, remember as many ebayers do intend to make big mistakes so watch out for those little misdemeanors!!!"	1

"Wish I had read the Amazon reviews before I purchased this phone.  Bought it almost 2 months ago.  Worked fine up until a few days ago.  Now it has started turning itself off as many have reported on Amazon.  I missed the msg re the death or a friend&apos;s mother yesterday b/c the phone turned itself off.  All of a sudden it is doing this constantly.  I played with it last night and the msgs showed up.  The msgs weren&apos;t even on the phone when I first turned it back on until I majorly played with it.  I went online and asked questions.  This seems to be a major problem with this phone and looks like if I can&apos;t figure it out I will be searching for another phone.  Certainly would not recommend it.  Glad I didn&apos;t pay too much for it.  I did read the ebay reviews and everything looked great re the phone.  Not so in my case, altho it did take 2 months for this to happen!"	0
With all the good review I expect something great. Until I got a battery issue. Is it natural or is it just simply bad luck. The battery only last 1 day.	0

"With only one exception, I have been buying Nokia phones over the last 10 years. This phone has everything one can wish for.   Much more features than an iPhone, comparable quality, for less than half the price. It is even much less expensive than Android phones, which don&apos;t reach the level of functionality and are light years from Nokia&apos;s product quality.  I wished Symbian^3 would have the same popularity as Android, which would lead to much more apps. Too bad that Maemo doesn&apos;t run on this machine."	1
"With the feature motorola blur you can have updated info from your friends on facebook, twitter etc in an instance. The android market is also a great feature"	1
"With the price drop off this phone it's definitely one of the best options out there and can complete with a lot of flagship devices. Stock Android with frequent updates, solid cameras, 128gb onboard storage, quick and snappy. Not too big or small. Solid build quality. Good screen quality. Overall a solid device for around the same price you would pay for a budget phone. I got mine for $260. In comparison, the Huawei Mate SE good for $250. The phone got a bad rep when it came out due to the initial price and early issues work software. After several upgrade this is a solid device for a solid deal!"	1
With this seller you can buy with out fear.. One of the fastest service I had in years.. Top quality of items and prices.	1
"Within eight days after receiving this cell phone, the battery stopped charging. I bought a NEW battery for this phone and it still didn't charge so I requested a refund. The seller(megaelectronics) nor EBay did not refund me because EBay stated that the phone had to be sent back in the same condition it was received. How was I suppose to know I was receiving an already defective phone? I was SCAMMED!"	0
Within the first week the phone would freeze on me and shut off. After a month the phone screen went completely white and never came back on. Thankfully the seller refunded me my money but it was a hassle because this phone was a gift for my moms birthday. Now I had to take it back and replace the phone once I got the refund. This left my mom without an operable phone for nearly 3 weeks. 	0

Used the phone for 2 days and went back to my old phone that at least holds a charge and takes good pictures. The volume on this phone is horrible. It did have some great apps to it, if it only would stay charged long enough to use it. I travel almost 40 miles one way each day to work and if it&apos;s not holding a charge, it doing me no good."	0

Worst phone i have ever had! Yes it was big and i liked it first 30 minutes but it wouldnt even cut off and then kept getting stuck on blue start screen. Battery charged all night & then turned it on 8am...batter died at 3pm! NEVER EVEN GOT TO CALL ANYONE OR SEND TEXTS! Phone wouldnt do that! Only got on messenger but thats all . It wouldnt even let me download a walmart app!  So discouraged & now having to return it!  Was bad from factory i guess. So frustrated. Spent 2 hrs on phone (house) with tracfone as they tried to fix & trouble shoot.  I dont recommend this phone.	0
"Worst phone iv ever owned. Windows mobile is so slow it takes on average 3 minutes to view something as simple as a text message. I even tried &quot;modding&quot; it by putting android on it but to no avail, android is an improvement but it has so many bugs because it is not meant for this phone. Save your money and get an android or apple smart phone."	0
Worst product I ever bought. Stop working within 2 months of purchase. It shows it is unused but seller is rolling customers I guess. Worst experience ever.	0
Worst quality about this device is the audio! Don't even waste your time if sound is important. Front speakers are full of high end noise and distortion. Software still buggy and lte doesn't work well AT&T. But rapid charging is the best option since you can't go a day with a full charge.	0
"worst seller ever! the item was never delivered Ebay buyer protection had to make me a full refund, because this seller never show up,ignoring me and lying to me, really bad!"	0
"Worst seller ever, very rude when I contacted him, I was very polite but he's just a  waste of time, never again. "	0
Worst service ever!	0
Worst shipping ever. I still didnt get the product i ordered. Almost 3 weeks now	0
Worth the dollar. Good stuff	1
"Worthless phone, can not be activated by any cellular provider. I&apos;m sure the seller knew that. Why do they sell you something that is no good. Shame on you."	0
Would absolutely buy from again	1
"Would buy again, fast shipping too! Came within 4 days of buying the phone"	1
"would buy from this seller again very trustworthy and very quick to get it in the mail so I could recieve it fast, beautiful phone just what he said it would be.  Thank You &amp; God Bless                                    Mrs. Dunham"	1
"Would do business again, thank you! "	1
"Would have been great if I knew beforehand it only worked on T-Mobile towers. This wasn't disclosed in the phone's description. Should have been. Seller might not have known, so I will give benefit of the doubt. "	0
Would have rated it 5 stars but it was locked when I received it. Like it was stolen. This was a huge nuisance to unlock and took me at least 4 hours to figure out how to do it. I should have payed less if I was informed of it being locked. Otherwise everything was perfect.	0
Would never buy Nokia again... I am just glad I didn&apos;t purchase it for myself. Takes a long time to charge the phone. Just a very few free apps to download.	0
Would not connect to microsoft account. Many users on line with same problem. Did phone reset as told but it did not work. Lost all data.	0
would not keep chaarged! hoorrible phone.  	0
"Would not recommend seller. I tried to connect the phone through straight talk since it was a straight talk phone, but it didnt work. When I tried to return it, he told me theres no refunds and that was that. Would not buy from again "	0
Would not turn on. Do not trust this company	1
wouldn&apos;t know as I couldn&apos;t use it!!  Was sold a phone I couldn&apos;t use and seller refused to take it back after he said he would!!	0
Wouldn't buy this kind of phone again	0
Wouldnt know if it was good or not since this dishonest seller sent and empty packet not once but TWICE.   DONT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!!!! 	0
Wouldn't sync with my sim even though its tmobile and supposedly unlocked. I've bought an unlocked LG V10 before and this one really sucks in comparison	0
Wow esta supuer bueno es un buen te lefono gracias 	1
"Wow! This was the first camera phone I got! The beauty of this is the camera, you plug in the bottom! Such a good phone, my partner got the same phone! The camera came with a little case, and easily plugs in. The photos it takes are two types, small and large."	1
Wow!!! Thank you. I am so happy with this phone. You're awesome. Thanks for the speedy shipping	1
"Wow, I must say you guys have some nerve to ask for a review on this ITEM!! YOU guys took the seller side... clearly u can check my buying history for this phone, lol and u will see that the seller has a ALL SHARE CAST HUB as the cell phone. WRONG DESCRIPTION ONCE AGAIN. HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. I WILL NEVER BUY ELECTRONICS ON EBAY. THE SELLER was able to keep my hard earned 72.00!! I even shipped the device back. I must say eBay u don&apos;t have my trust any longer. U made a decision that was not logically. You must show &quot;love&quot; to your buyers too. Not just the sellers. This experience... i was better off going to brandsmart. I feel like i was begging for my Refund back. Snakes....So eBay if this review is actually reviewed. U will see the sellers was w r o n g! No electronics will ever be bought by me here. Be careful. You have no clue who your buying from. Will it be the right description? What if its not. Will you get your money back.. probably not. Not worth it."	0

Y'all sold me a phone that was for parts only and it doesn't say it anywhere on the description! And I'm very pissed off about it.	0
"Yeah this is exellent no expensive phone.My son Love it;very easy to use to it,specially for people that don`t need lot of extra features."	1
"Yes as the title says this is not a smartphone, its does everything your tablet pc would do but better (additional qwerty keypad) its not that good on the phone side of things as it does not support a lot of stuff you get as standard on most mobile phones nowadays, i.e. mms not supported and the mobile service is more like an additional extra rather than a main feature like on some of the tablets nowadays that take a sim card and are 3g enabled, overall this is a very powerful little gadget, more of a internet tablet than a phone in my view, but as a phone its on the heavy side as with all high end gadgets, I&apos;d recommend to people who like me wanted to view full web pages without having to wait and scroll down across etc and also its fast compared to symbian phones I had a N97 and 5800 prior to this and it kicks ass compared to them two, anyway if you need a mobile pc on the go this is for you, or if you just want a phone with touch features and something similar to the iphone dont go for thin instead choose one of the N series phones, they are more suitable, this is defo for tech minded people like me ;)"	1
Yes I love it a good value	1
Yes i would like to try one of these phones i have bought two on ebay both stated unlocked both had to be returned as they could not be unlocked in Australia  and i had to pay for the return one $80.00 one $140.00 as they have a lithium battery so not a happy chappy webace2	0
Yes no a good phone	0
"Yes the phone works and yes the phone came with the charging cord, but what good is it if I can&apos;t get it activated? The phone I bought has a pending bill against it and was still active under another persons account. I paid $52 for something I can&apos;t use and I want a refund. Oh, and also, the phone did not appear as described &quot;barely used.&quot; It looked like it had been dropped a few times and had scratches on the screen."	0
"Yes this phone is from 1999, but it can actually still be activated on Pageplus. Basically anywhere VZW works, this thing will.   The battery last for days, even from the 1999 stock.   It's super thin compared to most device from this erra, and fits well in your pocket. Sound quality is also Excellent. They don't make things the way they used to!"	1
"Yes, I recently purchased a Samsung A920 on ebay.  Several years ago I had had one, but it had gotten wet and never recovered.  I saw one for sale on ebay and the way the seller described it, made it sound as a like new phone.  So I bought it.  As it happens, when I received it in the mail, it was extremely used.  It was not in the shape it was sold to be. The seller said they were the original owner and it hand been gently used and it had never been dropped.  Let me tell you, that phone had been used hard and dropped and should have been thrown away, not sold on ebay.  My luck this year on ebay has not been good.  But....outside of the bad experience.....the Samsung A920 is one of the best phones I&apos;ve ever had.  Just wish I could get another one."	1
"YES, I WOULD LIKE I RECOMMEND THIS AWESOME PRODUCT A FRIEND BEST PRODUCT NICE CELL I LIKE BECAUSE IS BIG THE SCREEN"	1
"Yes, its a pretty good phone and everyone wants an iphone, but you can buy this phone for just 200$ or even less and they would probably be in the same condition. If you want a small phone, go ahead but its a waste paying more that 200$ for an iphone 5s with 16GB"	0
"Yes, this phone is great and it works very well... I would defiantly buy from this seller again.&quot;....................&quot;.........................................................................................................................................................."	1

Thanks ebay to help me find it."	1

"you are a bad,cheat. Everyone is careful when dealing. Do not buy and sell with this seller"	0
You are false advertising. I would like the phone I purchased which is a Grand X Max 2. Not the phone you sent. 	0
You are selling my stolen phone! I have alerted police and they will be in contact with you shortly. 	0

You can have all the proof you need to see that the seller deceived me and yes you can say that I was naive but what's even worse is that PayPal has refused my refund request...	0
You can receive and send texts but the calling quality is extremely poor caller cannot hear you. Not happy with the product. 	0
You can tell that this item has a crack at the bottom corner and it is false advertisement to say that it is an open box when obviously this item has been used.	0
"You cancelled the payment with a lie , the eBay was charging to high commission and sent me you phone number, I WANT MY MONEY REFUNDED NOW."	0
"You cant beat the price for this phone. It has all the bells and whistles of the higher priced phones. I have no complaints as it does everything I want it to and more. Takes very nice pictures, streams music, 4G, and had no dropped calls."	1
"You can't find a price this cheap for this type of phone. I paid less than $60 for it, unlock code, cost 99 end of story. High quality phone that would have cost me way over $ 200 or More!!! It was worth every penny. "	1
You can't go wrong purchasing this phone for the price.  It is a nice phone with good features and best of all it comes with one year of service and 800 minutes!	1
You can't hear very good when talking on it. I jave set every setting possible.	0
"You can't use data while on call. Reception horrible even in middle of 4g area. Tried new SIM...didn't help. Goes from full 4g signal to one bar of 1x when a call connects. Older Android with same SIM card has better reception and functionality...When I contacted seller to let them know, after trouble shooting for weeks with carrier, seller was defensive and unhelpful. Sad to have such technology and it be as worthless as a tin can and string..."	0
you do not have a stable price because before you had this phone at 87.99 and now it is 100 dollars that you spend	0
You get an awesome product for a good price. I am recommending others to this product.	1
"You get what you pay for.  I downgraded from Samsung to a cheaper BLU phone only because I was nto sure that I was going to stay with my phone service much longer and if I switch in the not-too-distant future, then I did not want to lay out a large sum of money for a useless phone.  This phone is does the job well enough to fill the gap.  I needed to replace a broken Samsung phone and Fry's Electronics sells BLU phones, so I talked with the salesman, handled one in the store, and felt reasonably safe in purchasing it.  There are a few pros, but more cons, which is why I really do not care for this phone and will replace it as soon is I've gotten my use out of it. Pros:  This model has a bright screen, a fast CPU, and does not lag in videos, unless your carrier is weak.  It is well built, light weight, and the 8MP camera is outstanding for both video and pics.  The ringtones included are voluminous and the ability to change setup and personalizing it works well.  the speaker and mic works well, maybe better than the phone I replaced, but it was a few years old.  Anyway, people have no problem hearing and understanding me and vice versa.     Cons:  The program interface is bad.  For example, you can't directly go to other phone functions from another page.  Instead, you have to swi"	0
You get what you pay for. Its cheap. Keys are hard plastic. I like Samsung&apos;s padded qwerty better. The phone doesnt fit into your hands well and it doesnt feel balanced.	0
"You guys so annoying, leave me aloneeeeeeeeeeeee!!! And I hate eBay, I hate PayPal. I&apos;ll never do business with you guys again, i swear.

"You will regret buying this phone. All the bells and whistles everyone speaks of are there, they&apos;re useless on a Windows phone. As with any Windows based phone, the apps don&apos;t function. Example: there is a Twitter app, it never auto-updates. Foursquare isn&apos;t GPS linked. If this phone has an incoming text, it&apos;s locked up. You can&apos;t hang up the phone. If you get multiple texts at one time while on the phone it may be over 1 minute before the phone responds to hang up. I&apos;ve read of horrors of downloading Android to this phone. RUN don&apos;t walk away from this unit."	0

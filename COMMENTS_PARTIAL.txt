"  As of this review there are Note 5's on the market. Picked up a new Note 3 for less than 1/2 the cost of the newest model. At less then $300 buying the phone outright is better than making payments to a carrier in my opinion.    I like the big screen on this phone. It's easier to read text, watch videos, and view images. The S-pen makes it easy and fast to interact with the phone's many features.   If your primary needs are for text and phone this Note 3 is probably more than you'd need.    If you want an easy to view screen combined with features of a notepad this Samsung is a good choice."	1

 Great condition product! Was as described on listing! Very reasonable price and fast shipping. Great seller! :-)	1
 I am very happy with this iPhone 7.  It was rated a 9 out of 10 but I saw nothing wrong with it. I think it is a very good value. 	1
 I did return the phone because  unable to activate it with Verizon company	0
" I think it's just been a week , the battery life is hard to tell right now because I have used it a lot learning a new phone and where everything is on it. I got four years out of my other Lg model so that's why picking another. So far I like it and it's like I said just getting use to things in different places then a phone your use to. Pic's are good, sound is good. A very good value.."	1
 It is bullshit 	0
 mine only lasted 2 months and failed 	0
 only Fast delivery  Sends batteries do not work in some phones buyer does not care and does not give any attention does not keep the customer even if it buys him constantly  I did not like not responding to questions and letters	1
" purchased a Sony Xperia Z3 compact one month ago from Amazon with Warranty. Liked the phone and the features.  Today  I went to the hardware store. And then drove to my siste""s house.  I deceided to text her that I was there and ready to paint her garage.    I could not swipe the top of the screen.  Noticed a crack in upper left hand corner.  The phone is in an aluminum framed case and is covered from day one with tempered glass screen protectors.  The screen protector is undamaged.  The phone has never been dropped or sat on.  I carry the phone in the side pocket of my carpenter pants. Take it out when I get to my destination.   I contacted Sony support chat online for warranty repair.  Spoke to a Jason.  After he asks me  a bunch of questions even though I started the chat with information I gave above.  Then tells me I'm sorry, Sony does not cover this kind of damage.   I will never buy a Sony product again.  Sony should be ashamed and dishonored.  You have been warned.  Look else where for your electronics."	0
 thanks a million times really appreciate you sending me another phone charger you are a five star general one love	1
 the product doesn't even work and no answer from seller 	0
 UPDATE #1 I talked with Ectaco 2 more times. The first time I was told I Broke my phone and that I would have to send the phone to China to be fixed and I would have to pay for it and it would take 2 months !!! So I told the guy off and filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau and wrote the previous post and posted it on there distributors adds on the net. After a few weeks I called again and talked with teck support this time. He said they were willing to give me a NEW PHONE with the latest updates if I would remove my reviews on their distributors web adds. I said I would update my review. They said their distributors were pretty upset. How do they think I felt? It took almost a year of bitching and filing this review to get them to replace my phone. It is sad when companys make customers go to this extent to get customer service. They did send me a NEW PHONE and one of their teck guys even emailed me all my contacts. Thank you for finally getting this straightened out. I went to update the reviews on AMAZON and they were removed ???????      I would like to give my experience with Ectaco Inc. and the I travl 2 also look them up at the BBB and complaints on line. In Oct of 2015 I bought an I travl 2 that was suppose to have Spanish in it. I paid to have it delivered 	0

".  The phone is perfect and hubby is thrilled. Simple to use; takes a beating and continues to work. Once even run over by a tractor and still works, and dropped into 4 feet of liquid nitrogen fertilizer and by the time they got it out of the tank, washed and dried was 20 minutes.  Still works."	1
"...EVER larger phones (even Apple admitted such by introducing their 4"" screen version!), but this smaller Samsung mini has - so far - been excellent!"	1
???  where is my item?  i paid for it 30 mins after i won it and its been 7 days with no responce of when or why you dont send my pcell phone.  please respond or send my item	0
"+narrow bezel, battery life between 1.5 and 1.75 days, vivid colors, good display, powerful processors  -3.5mm jack missing but that's how life moves on - hail Bluetooth ;)"	1
1. It is thin but way too wide   2. supports only video playback  3. cant hear because call volume is low  3. the controls take acclimation  4. It is almost useless. Get a phone that is helpful.	0

"12/30/218.    I LOVE IT EASY SERVICE, EASY USE, BEAUTIFUL, FAST,& MANY APPS THANK YOU "	1
"1st phone would not charge, 2nd the screen would not work. we have paid for shipping 3 times. Seller seems to have no concern about my problem. Does not want to help with shipping or seem to care if we ever get a phone that works. Very, Very, terrible service. Gave the seller ever chance to make this right. My son has went without a phone for all this time that the trips back and forth to UPS have taken place. Think about the service you will get before you buy from this yo-yo."	0

"5 stars, great phone."	1
"A bit on the big side, but so far, it's rugged and simple. Does the minimal smartphone stuff I actually need like web browsing, and has older features I prefer, like a headphone port and a keypad. Also, no touchscreen, which is a major plus in my book.   I need and prefer a tough phone. I bought this to replace my old Samsung Rugby 4, which was worn out. So far, I'm very happy with it."	1
A couple of weeks ago my phone went out on me and stopped working. I was in desperate need of a replacement and saw them selling the exact same phone for a great price and couldnt believe it! it was listed as used so i expected a little ware.i had to try though needless to say some lucky bidding n a few days later i was surprised with a phone that looked new out of box deff. blown away and would do business again thank u so much!   Hope ur around for a long time	1
a frauddon't believe him	0
A good product very light in weight and functioning powerfully.	1
"A great phone I feel this phone is worth every penny  And do you know why? Simple: the HTC One is one of the best-designed phones on the planet. Not content with inventing a new machining process to allow the body to be all aluminium, the Taiwanese firm has extended the screen to the edges of the chassis further than ever before, meaning you&apos;re getting a 4.7-inch Full HD display without the additional heft you&apos;d probably expect."	1
A great way to purchase a phone without signing a contract. Recommend everyone to purchase items from Ebay.	1
A lot of scratches in the back side which seller did not specified	0
"a new battery was installed and the phone powered on, but the battery drained to dead almost immediately. the battery was recharged, phone powered on again, and the same thing. paid $130 for a phone that does not work, and the case and screen have small defects so I wasn't able to sell it for parts."	0
a phone i ordered it didn&apos;t work on my t-mobile sim card i tried on different sim cards but it still didn&apos;t work.I like the phone but it does&apos;t work so it worthless for me. the phone still sit on my desk.	0
"A rare example of smart phones with qwerty keyboard, and this is good. The old version of the android, but it is solved. Not such a great performance, but for surfing and communication lacking in abundance, you can run some games."	1
a top phone you will never go wrong with this phone no matter what you do battery life is good and talk time even tho this phone is over 10yrs old it still ranks at the top 10/10	1
A very good phone for the price. In an excellent condition and works perfectly. The seller even included charger and an adapter. Thank you. Very pleased!	1

"About two weeks ago,  I sold a phone to a friend of mine, and it just so happened that i drop the phone by accident and it broke. i then decided to replace that phone for this one, at the time it look like a great offer, after reading the description twice, i decided to bid on it. i won the item.   It arrive very fast, that&apos;s good, but it was incomplete. The seller send the phone but misplaced the battery, and told me that the phone comes without a back cover. The charger is not for this LG phone, the one the seller send me is for a samsung phone, not LG.    I am not the king of person that likes to leave negative feedback at all, I rather communicate first and try to work things out, the last resort is a negative.    I requested the seller for a refund, but if I had the need to buy a phone on e bay again, it will not be from this seller, and I hope that anyone that reads this would think about it, before giving your money away.    this is why I never had a chance to use the phone."	0
"absolutely love it!!! easy to use, so much I can do with it! great purchase, would definitely recommend"	1
Absolutely the best phone to update to that can still fit in a pocket!	1
According to Sprint this phone was not even worth the shipping and handling. But i can play the bubble game. Sprint could not get the phone up and running. I really wasted money having just being out of work and needing the phone for my new job.	0
Actually bought it for my dad because he was frustrated with the newer phones. He just wanted a phone that&apos;s it. This works great for him. Plus he no longer butt dials people	1
"Actually, I am waiting to here back from them because we need to return the phone. It doesn&apos;t receive reception anywhere and freezes up all the time. My daughter loves the way the phone looks but after getting it for christmas and trying to use it, it was a waste of money."	0
"Advertised > Verizon - Verizon tech, said that phone is not comparable with their system."	0
after 11 days the item still has not delivered.   I sent a request for tracking information 4 days ago and there was no response.	0
After 7 days from date of Pay Pal payment I still do not have the phone.  The listing stated delivery 3-7 days.  Now it has changed to unknown???  Don&apos;t count on getting what you pay for with free shipping in a timely manner.  I would have bought a similar item and paid for shipping had I known I could not count on a delivery by the 7th day from payment.	0
After a year in a half I had to change the battery. That is the only problem I have had with this phone. It is amazing I love LG phones very dependable the camera isn't that great buy who cares all in all a great phone. 	1
"after buying the phone on June 22, 2012 it worked great until July 30, 2012. Then the SD card slot went bad &amp; it won&apos;t recognize any SD card. So basically I threw away $115 on a phone that can&apos;t be used to take ANY pictures!"	0
"After getting through a few minor technical glitches, with the help of the seller, I'm in love with this phone.  I needed a smart phone but did not need the features of the larger, newer phones.  The size is perfectly compact.  It performs all the functions that I need with great ease and is a great little work horse!"	1
"After having to buy two phones because the first was mailed to the wrong address and the sender refused the change of address, the phone is okay. Better than first turbo in speed but shatter proof screen is made of a soft material that scratches easily. Also the ""good"" condition mentioned. The phone had a good amount of dings and dents in it. So not exactly the easy nice refurbished phone they described."	0
"After I received the phone, I notice it would not charge with the adapter they sent. I try other chargers and nothing work.  The phone was only half charge.  I called vendor and told them about the problem, they told me that every phone is inspected before leaving the shop.  Well, they miss that one, so I return the phone and the sent me a replacement phone. The phone they sent didnt have a charger adapter at all.  I had to purchase a charger, after purchasing the charger I had it activated at a cricket store, and the store personnel informed me the phone had water damage, at this point I was fed up and didn&apos;t want to do anymore business with this vender."	0
"After losing my original L90, I bought the new model phone from T-Mobile.  The camera on the new phone does not take close-up photos well and this is a feature I need.  The L90 phone was only available from the internet, but it was in as-new condition and it has worked flawlessly for 3 months."	1
"After owning the M8 model for a couple years, I expected a fast battery drain. What I didn't expect was the phone to drain to 80-85%, then drop to under 20%, then shut completely down. I don't mean restart shutdown, I mean android reinstalling itself six times in a five day period. The only way to avoid this was to leave it plugged in continuously. "	0
"After reading several reviews online, it appears this is the best phone for assurance wireless. So that&apos;s why I got it ...  The camera feature is decent. Easy to text. Battery life decent. Fairly tough exterior (i&apos;m a klutz and it&apos;s surviving me). Excellent screen lock feature. No pocket dialing.     True it&apos;s no iPhone or android, but seeing as neither of those is an option with assurance wireless it&apos;s the best you can get. And I like it. :)    Plus it&apos;s fairly easy to find screen guards and cases for this model. So that&apos;s a nice plus."	1
After the auction closed they pulled the item off of eBay	0
"After using IOS and Android smartphones&apos; over the years, the Windows Phone 7.5 is by far the most user friendly, and slickest UI I have used.  It has everything you need built into it without the need for seperate apps, it&apos;s buttery smooth in scrolling and the camera is brillant. Can&apos;t wait to see what Samsung has to offer when Windows Phone 7.8 and Windows Phone 8 arrives this fall!    Pros: Built-in speakers, Bright display, Inexpensive, Durable, Realistic color, Lightweight    Con: Battery life"	1
"After you completed payment, seller disappeared and no item you get!!!! JUST A BUSINESS SCAMS~"	0
All buttons fell off within 2 weeks. 	0
"all i can say to you, this beats my android ....  "	1
"All parts arrived when promised, but phone did not work as told.  You cannot hang up, battery will only charge when phone is turned off, and phone itself had many scratches upon deliver.  Very disappointed."	0
All the awesomeness that is an iPhone7	1
"ALL YOU HAVE TO GO BY IS THE SELLERS WORD. THEY TAKE PICTURES OF A NEW PHONE THEN SEND YOU THE BIGGEST PIECE OF CRAP. THIS PHONE SOULD HAVE BEEN PUT IN THE GABARGE. I WOULD GUESS THAT 90% OF THE SELLERS ON E-BAY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE BUYERS. YOUR FEEDBACK SYSTEM DOES NOT WORK!! IF I WOULD LEAVE NEGATIVE FEEDBACK FOR THIS SELLER, HE IN TURN WOULD LEAVE NEGATIVE FEEDBACK ON ME WHEN I HAVE DONE NOTHING WRONG. SO YOU CAN&apos;T WARN OTHER BUYERS ABOUT A SELLER. YOU JUST HAVE TO ACCEPT THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE BEEN RIPED OFF, AND TRY NOT TO BUY ANYTHING ELSE ON AUCTION."	0
already dropped it in the mud and it came out 100% ok.   Video files have to be formated to mpg4 to play. Solid phone very heavy duty. Ideal for clumsy people.	1
Also I can't update my software cause the GSM go locked 	0
"Although item listed as used,it was better than expected. Item was in excellent condition!!!   Cudos to the seller"	1
"Although the iPhone is all good in terms of looks and functions, the battery life is really really low. Tried to charge and it was still at 4% after 2 hours."	0
"Although this could now be considered an ""older"" model smartphone, it's a very good phone.  We have used this phone for about 4 years.  I dropped mine in the ocean, so I bought another one on ebay to replace it because it's such a good phone.  It does everything.  There may be newer models that are better or faster at this point, but this was the best phone I have owned, so far.  It has good battery life, unless you leave various features turned on.  Then the battery life could be sucked down quickly.  But I have been able to use this phone all day without charging it, if I turn on ""battery saving mode.""  Very easy to use, a lot of storage, and an excellent camera.  "	1
"Always a great experience shopping from Breed! Great packaging, super quick delivery, and most of all, item as described or even better. Trillion stars********* One of, if not my favorite ebay Seller. Always recommended. "	1

An amazing phone. High quality in all of its features. So many parts to it. Still figuring it out so I can use it to its best!	1
"An executive was interviewing a young woman for a position in his company. He wanted to learn something about her personality, so he asked, &quot;if you could have a conversation with anyone, living or dead, who would it be?&quot;    She quickly responded, &quot;The living one.&quot;"	0
"and just for emergencies or a teen starting with a phone   I would say this phone would be a teen/kid just starting with a phone. The t229 was a good phone, but the friends that had it experienced it shutting down and it had glitches where the front paint would chip and it wasn&apos;t even dropped, seriously one still had his in a case, took it off and it had marks, idk why, or if it was because of the hard case or what.    But this phone is tons better. It reduced all of the glitches of the previous model that i and my friends had. It&apos;s a much better purchase. You wont be disappointed at all in this phone."	1
Any cell phone that is older than 2 years old will not hold a good charge. Don't recommend buying. 	0

"As you can see in the first picture, at the bottom of the phone, the phone is supposed to be bezels, its not in that picture. Also, in the first pic as well, theres no notch at the top, and the text on the screen doesnt look like how apples text is. Your selling a fake iPhone in the original box for almost $1000?!? To know if is a real apple product, look up the serial number and track it. "	0
"At first glance you&apos;d never guess that the 6280 is a 3G handset. Yes, it&apos;s a little on the fat side, but hey, it is a slider, and it doesn&apos;t look much thinker than non-3G phones. 3G might not even be the killer feature for you -- there&apos;s an FM radio, a 2-megapixel camera and it&apos;s all easily accessible without opening the slider"	1
"At first i thought there was going to be a problem , but the seller contacted me right away to explain the delay and for that , I&apos;m really impressed.                 THANK YOU"	1

"Awesome camera, long battery life so far. Spectacular 4k display. No issues yet on freeze ups or error messages.

"Awesome sauce, indeed.  I wanted to exchange my Android phone for an Apple iOS and this is the ticket.  Smaller form factor more easily fits in my pocket.  Clean, clear easy changeover.  Interfaces with my iMac.  I now have an iPhone like everyone else in my family.  Very happy with this purchase.  "	1
Awesome seller.....great price and fast delivery...will be looking to see what he's selling first...	1
Awesome to do business w 	1
"Awesome, just like the original iPhone, but faster and prettier.  The retina screen is beautiful.  It makes my lockscreen with Megan Fox wearing Armani underwear look great.  This is my 2nd iPhone 4 - Once you start using it, you can&apos;t go back to older, slower, less resolution iPhones.    People say its just &quot;another Apple scam&quot; but its not - its just as great as the original iPhone - but again, faster and prettier."	1
"AWFUL, HORRIBLE, DECEITFUL seller!!! I purchased a phone from this seller and went to Verizon to activate it. I was told the phone was stolen. I will be contacting eBay to report this deceitful seller. DO NOT PURCHASE FROM THIS SELLER!!!!"	0

Battery is getting drained and full of scratches in display as well in case...totally unhappy with ebay...good bye ebay	0
Battery is very crappy... internal so u cant change it.   Other than that its a wonderful phone... much better than iphone	1
Battery life 12+ hours.  Fast processing. Superb camera.  Only objection is the fragility of the screen - so one must get a good case with proper edge protection.	1
"battery life is supposed to be 100 hours. but that battery used one lasts only 10 -20  hours. That is if i don&apos;t use phone call. if I used it was half day.  So I tried to buy new battery. But I could not find new battery in US. I am Japanese and I emailed to NEC customer service in Japan head office. They said that product was not sold in Japan. That is in China products.Then I had contacted the office in Hong Kong. They said that was old model, and already changed to new model because it was not popular there. So I could not buy new battery for that or don&apos;t use that anymore. just waste money because seller didin&apos;t tell the truth."	0
"Battery life terrible. Screen freezes up, Had to remove battery at times and restart to get this phone to work. I now see why they are selling cheap. Drops Wi-Fi constantly,  When you receive a text message all you see is the contact number and not the senders name. Save your money."	0
Battery only last a couple hours and phone shuts off at 30% battery. The in call microphone does not work can not make phone calls without using a headset or speakerphone	0

BE AWARE!!!Do Not Buy from this seller!!!!  i bought nokia N95. after one day of receiving this item it stopped working and when i talked about the refund they told me to send the item and they told me to spend my own money for shipping level and still i haven&apos;t get my refund.	0
be careful when looking at this phone from anyone. you cant use this phone without the sim card and boost will not sell you a new one so the purchase was useless. i think the seller knew this prior to listing it on ebay. when i asked her about it she said it was listed with no sim.	0
"Be very careful about, what you buy. they are very tricky in their statement and product they sell. i brought a unlocked samsung galexy s6 phone phone, I put my T mobile sim and it didn't work. Now they say even all the frequency were mentioned and says, GSM unlocked, it works only with Sprint.  Beware of what you buy. think three or four times before you buy."	0
"BEAUTIFUL PHONE, WORKS GREAT!!!!"	1

"Been looking for a phone for a while and i finally found this one for a reasonable and affordable price. Product came in one day late , probably because of the horrible weather conditions. Overall great product and just as described. Will definately buy from again."	1
Been wanting this phone for a long time! Now I finally have it thanks to ebay! The phone is everything you could ever want in a phone. Love the fact that it is a touch screen and also has internet. And for someone that isnt very internet saavy this is a great phone.	1
"Before I purchased this item it said on its description that this was an unlocked phone, however when I received it and installed my own SIM card from a different carrier other than Verizon the phone not only it doen't recognize the SIM but it will not work at all.   contacted the seller and they tell me that the phone is locked to the Verizon network and it will no work with any other network that is not of what their network is.  Very dissapointed! "	0
"Below the battery , there is a sticker upon sticker, Also the switch to power on is not properly sitted in the place, on one side its inside the cellphone, on other its upside, Overall product i received is below mine expectations, Also in SD slot and SIM slot there is a dust, mean the sets was not properly cleaned."	0

There are so many that I learn a new one everyday :). The camera on this phone is awesome! I have no complaints at all on this phone. If you are looking for a smartphone that is capable of internet surfing, taking care of your Ebay business, and getting you from one location to the next while messaging your friends and talking at the same time, this is the phone! I highly recommend the Samsung Note II to everyone and I promise you will not be disappointed!"	1
"Best. Phone. Ever. (Well, for now...)  Nothing bad to say at all, except the screen gets dirty easily...   This phone is thin, fast and gorgeous!  Antenna problem? What antenna problem??"	1
Better than expected. I gave it to my 8 year old as she's been bugging me for an iPhone for Christmas. Not activated but she can play her games	1
"Better then expected, just like new"	1
beware of this phone. The software issues make it impossible to access internet and widget store. I bought the phone because of the functions it was supposed to have. boy was i disappointed.	0
BEWARE...make sure when purchasing a phone from ebay to go to the companies website and check by the IMEI number to see if the device you are purchasing isn't locked or stolen. I made the mistake of rushing and purchased a device I couldn't even connect because it was a locked device by Metropcs. Hopefully I can get this issue resolved without having to escalate the situation.	0

"Bought this a little over a month ago based on good reviews and Samsung&apos;s reputation.  I must have got a lemon because it performs very poorly. It was good for maybe a week.  Blank screen for hours at a time.  We&apos;ve tried to be patient and give it time, then got busy and  I waited too - can&apos;t return.  $80 down the drain.

Can i get my refund  	0
"Can not give the seller a good review.  The shipment was fine.  There was an issue when trying to activate the phone, which did get taken care of.  The battery on the phone was not good.  I ended up taking it to apple. Apple tested it, and said it needed replaced.  I ended up paying another $80 to replace the battery.  I did notify the seller of this, but nothing was done to compensate for the extra cost. The phone is is good working order with very little wear and tear. That&apos;s the only reason for a second star."	0
Can only connect to 2G and that too sometimes. Last night i had to walk 1 mile in freezing cold to find a taxi because uber app could not connect.	0
Can&apos;t really say seeing right after I won the auction the seller was removed from eBay. Never got phone.	0

Changed from Palm Pre as I was having major issues with constant need to restart and sucky battery life. I have had no regrets buying my hero. I anticipated a poor battery life so I spent an extra $70 for the extended battery from Seidio which triple my battery life (usage time). I love it- likely you will love it too. Awaiting upgrade to Android 2.o Platform which I&apos;m told by HTC is coming soon. IPhone has strong competition.	1
Charger port broken he is a scammer 	0

"Clearly not the original phone so trying to resolve the problems has been difficult.The buttons constantly lock, or worse just will not work, no matter how hard or how many times you hit the same button. Restarting it does nothing. Battery life is less then 24 hours. The phone is set to English but a number of things are either in Spanish or French. Was hoping for a durable simple oldschool phone (the one I had in my highschool years) but this has been more of a hassle and waste of money. went back to using my other phone."	0
"Coming from a galaxy s5, it's a relatively small step up. Pros,  big beautiful bright hi deff screen. Very fast, has Android 6.0, very large battery, prices are very good for such a new high end phone. Cons,  even though it has a third larger battery, it can use it up very fast. Low use it will easily last a day. High use, it will start getting low by mid day. Other,  It feels thin and small for such a big screen, and the screen glass seems to not show finger prints. All in all, very pleased with it."	1

Could not activate this phone due to Walmart not scanning the activation code on the phone when Walmart sold the phone to Phoenix Liquidation.  This made the phone unusable as anything other than a paper weight.	0
"Could not get the phone to activate, had to return for refund, also seller to hard to contact, I try resolving this issue with seller, I could only get his voice mail.  The seller was bad about returning calls, so I had no choice but to request a refund.  I had since found another seller, bought the same phone at a cheaper price."	0

Dear eBay Shoppers be leery of this provider I purchase an unlocked Nubia phone took it to the carriers and it cannot be turned on I've sent several messages and get responses that if I take the phone and have it fixed that I will be reimbursed for the money I bought this phone with the understanding that it was brand new in the box unlocked generally when we unlock phones we would make sure that they work through at least one carrier at least I don't know what happened to the codes I was told that it might have the wrong firmware and I need to have it updated and pay money to get this phone usable please help me with this problem buyer beware of this seller	0

Decision to buy phone was the price very good price.  Unfortunatley the phone freezes alot I have to turn the phone off and then back on for phone to start functioning right and is not working proerly when texting the letter typed always inputs the incorect letter causing bad texts.  Item was described as NEW and is REFURBISHED and I could not buy insurance on phone at the local cricket store.  Now I have to purchase another phone because it is defective.  won&apos;t ever buy another phone from this seller.	0
Defective phone. Doesn&apos;t work. I don&apos;t recommend to buy from this seller. Will not get your money back. Seller is not professional.	0
Definitely not an iPhone...I bought it as a replacement for my Blackberry that I ruined until I could upgrade.  Horribly slow and going from one app to another isn&apos;t easy.	0
"Delivered in great shape, works excellent and it was delivered fast. I have purchased cell phones from different ebay stores and this is by far the best, really professional store."	1
"depite of  is a 2013 phone. it still runs the app smoothly. good battery life . it can last 2 or 3 days with normal use. I have no complain about the screen resolucion and size (just fine, satisfied my needs). if wanna go on the budget I highly recommend this phone "	1
"description said 9/10, phone arrived scuffed on all sides and a small crack on the lower right corner on the front of the phone  "	0
Description was spot on .	1
"Despite some of the negative reviews I&apos;ve read, (after using the phone myself), it turns out that I like this phone. Alot of people have said the phone freezes up. Well yes, that did happen when I first received the phone, before activating it on my Sprint account. I contacted Sprint through Customer Support through live chat. While activating the phone I told the chat agent about the phone freezing up issue. She stated that she had reset my device from her end, asked me to power the phone off then back on again. And the issue was resolved. I have been enjoying the phone since that day with no other freezing issues. I have dropped it on a hard floor while shopping and that didn&apos;t harm it at all. It still works perfectly. And may I add that I bought this phone (used) here on eBay, and to say that it was used, it works as if it&apos;s brand new. You can&apos;t always go by what you read in reviews. Sometimes it&apos;s best to experience things for yourself. For anyone else having issues with their phone freezing, maybe Sprint can fix your issue like they did for me. It wouldn&apos;t hurt to give them a call before returning it.    Now as for the features: I don&apos;t like the fact that the phone does not have a file manager to view what&apos;s on the memory card. All other phones I&apos;ve owned all had that option. This is the first phone I&apos;ve had without it. I assumed all phones had it, but I guess I was wrong. Pictures, videos, music, ect are saved to the card. You only access the files through the apps, such as the music player, and the fun menu. I wouldn&apos;t recommend using the phones default browser because it is not full screen. It&apos;s best to use the Opera that is pre-installed on it. Call quality is great, mp3 files play very loud and clear. The touch screen is very responsive. The phone is user friendly. Another thing I wish were different is the phone&apos;s wallpaper. You only get to see it when you press the power/lock button briefly to check the time. It only displays for about 5 seconds. As much as I love downloading wallpapers it&apos;s a bit disappointing not to see it most of the time. You also see it when you receive a text but only lightly dimmed when the phone displays the option to view or dismiss the message. Other than lacking a file manager and the wallpaper, I really like this phone. And I&apos;ll most likely be using it until it&apos;s time for an upgrade on my account."	1
Device is easy to use and a solid phone. The metal back makes it feel solid and not cheap and plastic unlike a lot of new devices (samsung). I have worked for t-mobile and sprint and this is my favorite phone that i have ever had the pleasure to use. It is fast and intuitive and works as it should. Its not to big and its not small either. It takes a beating unlike most never phone like the iPhone and Galaxy S3 that break after one drop. This holds up and keeps on kicking. I would recommend this to first time sell phone buyers as well as smart phone gurus as myself. All people will be pleased. overall an amazing device.	1
Did not care for the phone.  Antiquated compared to what is out there today.  Bought as a replacement for my teenager and he couldn&apos;t send or receive pictures.	0

DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER! DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!     This was my first time buying from this seller/ebay. it&apos;s very discouraging and disappointing to be robed your very first experience buying from ebay!! I purchased a sph-a940 cell phone as a gift for my sister from this buyer and she could not have the phone activated. after being told that the phone could not be activated i immediatly contacted the seller. my first message to the seller was...      11/9/06 HELLO FIX4YOU! I RECENTLY PURCHASED THE SPH-A940 CELLPHONE FROM YOU AND IT WORKS GREAT HOWEVER I CALLED SPRINT TO ACTIVE THE PHONE AND THEY TOLD ME I COULDN T BECAUSE THE ESN WASN T CLEAN. THEY SAID THAT SOMEONE HAS REPORTED THE CELLPHONE IN LOST OR STOLEN AND AND BECAUSE OF THAT I CANNOT HAVE THIS CELLPHONE ACTIVATED AND THAT I SHOULD CONTACT YOU TO RESOLVE THIS MATTER. PLEASE GET BACK WITH ME ASAP. the seller messaged me back and said this...    11/9/06 &quot;I purchase these phones in lots of 100. The reason I put the ESN number in my auctions is so you can verify that they can be activated. I am sorry but auction also states that all sales are final, sold as is&quot; I replied the seller message and said this...    11/10/06 &quot;Before I purchased the phone I ask you if the esn was clear and u told me it was and the phone was ready to be activated. I also asked if there where any scratches on the phone/lcd screens. do you remember? I would never purchase a phone that I cannot activate, that dont make any since.&quot; the seller never respond back to that message!!!!!!    It also states in the auction that &quot; A test call was made&quot; how is that possible whan the esn was not clean????? which is a bunch of bull $h!t. now i&apos;m stuck with a cell phone that does not work. now I&apos;m scared to buy from ebay or any other seller again!

I bought this phone bc i needed a cheaper cricket phone because i just got off maternity leave and didnt have alot of money to spend but needed a phone since i had a newborn at home. This phone is back in the box just sitting on my table and im stuck with it since it cant be refunded! Spend the little extra on a nicer phone, this is a waste of money and time!!!"	0

"Don&apos;t get me wrong, i liked it and all. but having to flip the screen to type and call people got annoying after about the first month! plus, with the TV, its only if its available where YOU live and they only have a handful of available cities. Plus, when sending a picture to say my email, it takes atleast 3 or 4 retrys till it actually sends and I have to hold the phone high in the air. (It&apos;s not where I live because I have had other phones that do just fine) Also, like an ipod, the screen gets dirty with fingerprints and everything. But if there was anything I did like, it was the camera. very nice :D"	0

"DONT BELIEVE THE HYPE!!!    I&apos;ve had this phone since the second week it came out. I&apos;m on my third one already (ended up going through 4) because of all the problems it has. I&apos;ve done everything the manufacturer and T-Mobile has asked me to (upgrade to Gingerbread and full reset) and I&apos;m still experiencing all the same problems.    What problems am I referring to? The phone has a MAJOR known issue that most G2X owners experience and that is the fact that the phone completely shuts itself down (yes even with a full battery) sometimes it will reboot itself, but most of the time it does not. You may be on an important phone call such as a doctor or a business client and the thing will just shut off. Boot up is slow so to return a phone call that has dropped from a shutoff takes awhile.    The dual core processor and the 4G network drains the battery super fast, so if you own one it&apos;s best to turn on the function that runs the phone on 2G.    Another problem I&apos;ve experienced is the LCD freezes up if I&apos;m on an extensive phone call which makes multitasking impossible (especially conference calls) and the only way to end the phone call is for the other caller to hang up and then take the battery out and reboot the phone again.    The operating system has its own issues. Many of the preinstalled apps will &quot;Force Close&quot; and cannot be accessed at all until you again turn the phone off, take the battery out, and then reboot the phone again.    LG continues to insist they are working on these known issues, but the phone was released in MAY! Almost 6 months later and still not fixed? Shame on LG for releasing such garbage before these major bugs were fixed. T-Mobile refuses to give me a handset from a different manufacturer (except the Sidekick which I do not want) since it is a manufacturer issue. They all keep giving me the same response (the manufacturer is currently working on the known issues)"	0
"Don't buy from these guys. It been a run around. Promise me working 4g phone for area then phone is stuck in portrait mode. So they told me I would get a refund of 29 bucks.

Waited then contact again after a month they said they send me a new one(ya ok) waited 2 weeks , then they said they say one from hong Kong  WTF.

"Ebay has everything on the internet when you seach an item that you wanted. The thing I don&apos;t like the most is the feedback. When the buyer bought an item, they (buyer) should leave the feedback for the seller to know how well he or she accomplish. IF the feedback likely to be ignored, the seller won&apos;t get any points or to improve the selling. The reason I bought it bc it&apos;s cheap."	1
"Ebay needs to require disclosure of any item sold that is just a part or that is not fully functional without adding parts to it to make it functional.

"Even though this phone has been discontinued, you can still find it free with new contracts. The phone takes great pictures, great mp3 sound, and has upgradeable memory.

"Everything about this phone met the description other than the screen, which clearly is a significant thing.  Was bleeding along the screen edges with a yellow tint.

"everything except that it has a tendency to freeze up from time to time but haven&apos;t seen a smartphone that doesn&apos;t yet off the sprint network, the only thing i don&apos;t like is the limited options for accessories cases, covers, otterbox(bummer) etc...... and a bit confusing would love to see an app or new option on the slider lock to be able to change how you can unlock it other than that great phone wuld prefer a faster processor but this one is good for the money i guess.would love to see a intercept II with some bugs fixed in operating systems and higher processor."	1
EVERYTHING IS AWESOME&gt;  The phone has a lot to offer for anyone.  I am a previous windows user and with this phone it takes a little bit to get used to the android features.  But read the manual and look  up things that are unfamilar to you.  The phone is just amazing and I love it.	1

"Fast, reliable, and everything youd expect from an Apple phone "	1
"Features that I use. Easy and good camera and video, mp3 player, FM radio is a plus too. Easy to use all around cell phone. I owned Sony Ericsson before and highly recommend if you don&apos;t need use of the web (which you can have access to)."	1
"Finally made the switch from iPhone to Android and the Pixel was a great starting point! I was able to transfer most of my settings, apps and content (pics, text messages etc.) effortlessly. Also, the camera on this phone is OUTSTANDING.. It has a lens blur functionality which outperforms the iPhone Portrait any day of the week. Plus, battery life is great and charges from 0% to 100% in about 2 hours (compared to 5-6 hrs for the iPhone).  This phone is awesome, please use it to kill your iPhone habit and step away from the dark side! :p"	1
Firefly is a2G phone and you can no longer get any service for it. Worthless an I'm so unhappy.	0
First day with device battery stay charged all day turn phone on with Metro PCS Works wonderful good product	1
First it was not unlocked second it was blacklisted that's pretty much it everything else was good	0
"First of all my daughter loves the phone. Its easy to use and works great with her Ipod, and Ipad. Her friends have iphones and they face time all the time."	1
First of all the seller listed this as brand new!! When it was a remanufactured cell phone. The seller said she had no Idea that it was remanufactured and offered a few dollars back. Iaccepted and gave her good feedback. So far the phone has worked OK. And I saved a few dollars.	0
"First of all, I did not want this product.  I cancelled within 8 minutes that I ordered it, and it took 16 days for me to get a refund from the seller.  I will never do business with this company."	0
"First of all, the price that people are attempting to sell this phone at is ridiculous. I bought it brand new from AT&amp;T for $30. It is NOT worth the amount that people are trying to sell it for nor was it even worth the $30 I paid for it. Worst phone I have ever owned. Touch screen is horrible. The only thing I can say I like about it is that texting was set up a bit like the iPhone&apos;s. This phone is JUNK! Do not waste your money! It is not a good phone new, used, or refurb, it is garbage. If you want to be frustrated and annoyed with it all the time, than this is the phone for you, otherwise save your money and buy something better for the same price."	0
First off the battery lif is terrible. Second of all the hole where u plug up the charger is the same hole where u plug up the headset so u cant talk on the phone and have it charging at the same time. If the charger pluggged up the phone thinks its a headset so u cant use it. the same thing with the blue tooh. ohU cant use any kind of ring tones for the text messagesing alo  u can do on this phone is tell it to vibrate when u get a text. phone i sjuts all the way dumb	0
"First one had an issue with microphone, second one with gap between the screen and the body. Returned and requested refund but not responding."	0
"First task I set the fingerprint scanner to, using my left index finger, was to activate the dialpad! No more fumbling around to make a call or take/add someone's phone number!!  I bought the 'Sunset Gold' 16Gb version. Its fast & reliable enough that I'm still liking this phone after 3+ weeks. Still learning all its features & tricks.   Fast & snappy once I changed the Power Saving mode to 'normal'. Programmed different fingerprints for various apps. Set different colour screen and led light flashing notifications for different message types / email boxes.   Currently using my 64GB micro SD card without any issues.  Battery easily lasts throughout my day with WiFi always on, chromecasting, phone  & WhatsApp calls and Google searching. Usually down to 40% at nights before recharging!  Note - had to cut my 2 Standard sized SIM Cards down to nano and nano sizes Only regret - I didn't know about the 32GB version before buying this 16GB version!"	1
First time I had a seller reach out to me promptly. Not only that he continued to keep me updated on shipping and even offered to place the outer box. It was a gift for my father. He was so surprised when it arrived. 	1
"Firstly no access to even basic apps like Viber, Youtube etc. and the ones you can manage to install does not run at all. Comes with failure errors. Too slow even for basic phone calls."	0
"flimsy phone, camera was not very good for being 5mp.  had phone for 45days and hardly use it, lg splash screen started flashing and now phone is dead, wont even power on.  wasted money.  would not recommend this phone."	0
For a cheap flip phone it's pretty dang good.	1
"For a smartphone that is 4-5 years old the iPhone 5 is still a versatile gadget. It's not the lighting fast iPhone 7, but this phone won't lag you to death. After being plagued by screen disease on the iPhone 6 Plus and after 5 replacement phones from Apple and my phones Carriers insurance i finally became fed up and bought the last good iPhone I owned.   Expect to replace the battery on these phones, due to the age the battery life will no longer be acceptable for every day use. The good news is that replacing the battery is easy and can be done with the right tools. Watch a lot of YouTube videos and take your time."	1

for some reason i do not recieve all of my text messeges   from certian service providers/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////	0
"For the first few days i had the phone it worked great. Within the first week i started experiencing more and more problems. From the phone randomly freezing, to just shutting down. The text messaging has gradually gotten slower and slower. As you type, the letters appear 5 to 10 seconds after you have written the word. Fortunatly the seller offered and exchange and return without any problems."	0
For the price I love it	1
"For the price you pay, it's piece of crap. The operating systems are optimized so much that you can use either iOS or Android. I had to sell this phone and get an Android phone for lower price but more functionality.   Thanks Apple"	0
"For what i want this phone for it&apos;s excellent,,,,i just wanted a simple phone i didn&apos;t need one or did i want one of the real fancy ones...it&apos;s great for me and nice and small......can&apos;t find to many cases for it i only have one and would like about 6 more ....thanks any suggestion on where where i can find them...i brought one on the internet already..none of the places in the mall have anything to fit this phone?????thanks again,,,,,,,"	1
"Found excellent price on the phone I wanted. Arrived next day. Rated a 10 of 10 it was a 10, near perfect  Bought a memory card, brought to Verizon, up and running in less than one hour. Supremely happy with price, product, time to arrival and quality. Samsung S5 Galaxy is a superb choice."	1
"freeze's all time, poor processing, reboot when over temperature. Too bad phone. Bluetooth allways reset."	0
"Friendly advice, you do not risk and do not buy anything from this seller. This is a deceptive seller. More information with regard to giving you the thing, praise, praise, but in reality they will be teleoni garbage. Blocked such that fail to help. They fraudulently transferred $ 70 blocked phone."	0
Fuck this shit . Two mounth of waiting	0
"Fully legit phone and battery, repackaged with charger and cord. As expected and delivered promptly. Lumia 950 is a great phone for those clinging to Windows Phone until the end. "	1

"Gets very hot, battery doesn't last more than two hours fully charged. Always had samsung phones, never had issues. Not impressed."	0
Go it for the wife and she loves it.	1
"good - phone size is perfect!  bad - 1- the signal was very poor, so could not make calls. (max call duration was 20 sec.) 2 - battery drain in less than 7 hours with no action on phone, i guess due to poor signal and constant look up for signal. 3 - sometimes phone becomes super hot, only shut down solves issue.  I was very disappointed with the purchase.  "	0
"Good and compatible with my country, battery last long with very clear receptions, the speaker produces soft clear sounds compared to my previous phone. The design is classic in terms of weight, size, width, thickness. High resolution pictures taken with details showing and better video recording with long battery life. Charging quick and last long especially when talking maybe on standby for 36hours before re-charging could be required. Browsing is fast, smooth and safe a lot of bits that could have been consumed if not fast enough. Wi-Fi is fast to connect and keeps tracks of save Wi- fi without have to research the Wi- fi again and again. Overall is excellent and work better for what I  Its designed to accomplished and I will recommend it for friend and scored it five stars."	1

Great improvement over the original Razr. This is the second one i&apos;ll own. The first one gave me two years of excellent service until I jumped in a pool with it in my pocket.   Improvements are  -Beefier and stronger hinge  -No Dust gets in the screen  -Excellent quality camera  -Screen resolution  -User friendly operating system and interface  -long battery life for the most part. After 18 months my battery life suddenly went much lower and I&apos;d have to charge it every night. Got a new battery and the darn thing lasts all week.     Great phone.	1

"Great phone great camera. Take some time to adjust coming from a Samsung,(missing the edge screen and some air movements). Lightning fast. No glitches. Do all jobs fast? Google Assistant is in another level (I dictate this review, set alarms, start Spotify and play music) does everything in a fun way). Unfortunately only in English no Greek language. Sound over Bluetooth is great. A lot of steps to configure the volume. Louder and higher quality than expected from a Bluetooth transmission. The screen is very nice but it's not a Samsung... Watching movies is okay but on dark scenes, you lose a lot of information. Need to boost The screen light just to see the scene. The camera is exceptional. Took a picture in 0 light and it came out astonishing. GPS is fast and accurate. Very satisfied"	1

"Great phone. The white BB is unique. Fast and handy. Knows everything and the battery keeps running for 2-3 days with intense use.  Pros: Handy, smart and fast, made of high quality materials.  Cons: The only cons is the necessity of the data plan, but without a data plan it doesnt worth to buy it.  Compared to the other phones the price/value ratio is high."	1

"Great value, great product, fast service."	1
Great value-Almost like new	1
"Great! The best Android phone.  Just if the 16GB memory is Build in memory, not the SD, it will be even better. Since the build in system memory is too small to be full often, I have to manually move app to SD almost every time I install new app. Plus some apps are not movable. So this is a headache.  But anyway, it is the best android phone in the market so far."	1
"great, its a great phone, though not the iphone 5 or 5s, but is perfect for the basic issues we all do"	1
Gret seller. Gret communication. Went out of his way to be sure that this will fit my needs. Thank you!	1
"Guy over pricing for something thats obviously stolen, like I mean get tf outta here dude. "	0
"Had a Brigadier and liked it. After four years battery wouldn't hold up and started doing weird stuff. Read some good reviews on Duraforce Pro. Since I've had good luck and service from Kyocera I gave it a try. Love it! Bigger screen, better ear speaker, can hear calls much better. Good purchase. I'd recommend to anyone."	1
Had a small issue but seller quickly responded and remedied the problem. 	1
Had for two weeks and died	0
Had no original box or or accesories either. And it had scratches and it was not described.	0
Had one with a bad power switch stuck in boot looping.   Swapped a good screen for the cracked one and now cruising along on Android JellyBean.  A parts swap victory.  	1
"Had same phone from T-Mobile that finally broke after 3 years. Bought this phone, took 2 weeks for delivery. Not happy with it for 2 reasons: 1) All Texting is T9 and cannot be changed to other texting options??? So it is basically useless for texting and saving phone numbers. 2) Battery charger port cover is not attached and is already lost. Do not buy these phones from overseas!!!"	0
HAD THIS PHONE AND ITS FEATURES ARE EXCELLENT SO I BOUGHT ANOTHER ONE.I WOULD RECCOMEND THIS PHONE TO ANYONE.	1
Had to get an android phone for uber and door dash apps to work. This phone was half price of what consumer cellular wanted. It is the same size as my windows phone and they both fit my belt case together. I kept windows phone active as it was only $10 for my second line and was able to sync the phones together and transfer my information to both. This phone is all and more than I expected and I'm elderly.	1
"Had to return product due to a screen fault... got my return purchase amount after 8 weeks minis the return postage cost... still waiting for reply to postage cost, all gone silent now after many request. Would not recommend buying high tech items from OS."	0
"Had trouble crarging this phone right out the box, it worked for a day, now it wont charge,"	0
"Hallo,  diese Handy ist ein biliger Trek aus China.  und der verkaufer ist ein turkisch Betrug  MfG 1974hutte!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"	0
"Happy with delivery of order, sooner than I expected. Seems like it has a bad battery. Sometimes when plugged in will say fully charged and then as i take it out it says 70% charged. Also when I take battery out the phone doesn&apos;t recognize the battery and sends an error message. I would love help on this issue otherwise I will seek other options."	0
"Hard to answer any of the questions above since phone arrived without battery cover (seller claimed not to know it should have one) or battery (seller called it &quot;oversight&quot;).  After purchasing battery found out that phone was faulty and only worked for 5 min. at a time.  I was only buying it to restore information from my Blackberry desktop application from lost phone so I could transfer it to new Google Android phone.    I did subsequently purchase a 7230 for the same purpose, and it worked like a charm in all aspects."	0
Hardly any scratches now I have to get a sim to test it out. I was taking it to the phillipines with me.	1
"Has Android 6, 5mp camera, WiFi, Bluetooth, memory expandable  to 128gb. This Phone is small easy to carry  around, really advanced for a low cost Phone. I love it! It's  not an Apple 7, but a great Phone for the buck. I highly recommend and would definitely  buy this Phone again."	1
Has no ad slot and no fm radio and only 4 go rom	0
"Hate it!!! Battery sucks, constantly running background apps (35 at a time)!!! Mini USB doesnt plug in tight. Runs very hot!!"	0
"Have had 2 new ones in the past year, both of them the ear speaker quit after about 4 months, There is no fixing this problem not  for a $40 phone, just throw it away and buy something else that's what I did."	0
Have not even received it yet. EBay shipping logistics  is horrible.   Amazon tracking has you beat hands down	0
"Have only used this phone for a week or so, but it has handed everything I've thrown at it with easy and snappy response. The camera is wonderful if the lighting conditions are good, mediocre without. Then again this is not a dedicated camera. It's very fast and the battery life is great. "	1
"Have to put the call on speaker bc you can't understand anything if it's on call unless you put it on speaker, then everyone around hears your call. Very annoying "	0
Haven't got it yet waiting for it to come	0
"Having individual letters to touch makes texting SO much easier and more accurate than the typical on-screen keyboard. I dumped a bigger phone to go back to this model, which AT&T doesn't make anymore. "	1

"He sent another phone, different than I bid,they spent more than 15 days to reimbursing to pay you "	0
He sold me iPhone 6 with damage and he said that he can't give me money back because I did a damage. He said all story about how I did it. I don't know how he knows that.  He also said that I'm a liar and he doesn't have a return policy.  It was the worst seller I ever have.  Be careful with him before you buy something from him.  	0

"Hello.  Writing the review after several weeks of use.  Fast shipment and delivery, cheap package but it's Ok. Great design, well-made, great camera. Phone is fast-n-furious, no doubt.  But...  there are critical disappointments:  1st - scratch on speaker grill - you see it every time you look at the phone. 2nd - no oleophobic coating - seems the screen or screen glass was replaced by non-original one. 3rd - battery... ooooohhhhh.... I wouldn't write the review if battery was ok. But it's not! Its capacity is ~1600 mAh (from 0 to 100% charging). After few calibrating procedures it became a little bit better but still very weak. Local Samsung service asks $50 for original replacement (including work).   See attached photos.  Conclusion: the phone seems to be NOT refurbished. It seems to be USED but fixed one."	0

"Howdy,  this is a superb phone. I had an iphone before this, and honestly i like this more. I love the andriod OS, it&apos;s amazing. It takes some getting used to, but it&apos;s awesome once ya get the hang of it. The andriod market is great too, and most of the apps are free unlike the iphone appstore. The call quality and volume is good. It has a super display as well, things look sweet. The touch screen works well too. The phone build is nice too, has a sleek and funky look to it. On the whole, it&apos;s a great phone and you will LOVE it."	1
"HTC. Hell of a Time Charging. After being a long time other brand user i decided to get this phone because of the rave reviews however from the phone i received was not worth more than a star. Whats good; Nice looking, fast boot up, easy to use interface. Its your average android powered phone. Camera seemed good enough only used it a few times. Bad: The battery/power management on this phone are garbo.. After 40 percent battery your phone could die at any second and just chain reboot itself out of power trying to get it to turn back on. This is something that happened ON EVERY CHARGE. It started snowing outside today and having a phone that i know will work when i need it to im sending it back today. Also it seems fairly annoying to find a screen protector and case for this phone, no local retailers carry it a few places carry the protective glass online but they are just generic fits. Maybe the phone i received was a fluke but for me and being my first time out with this brand i will not be trying the HTC 10 again back to the drawing board and back goes the accessories i ordered."	0
"I  bought this item in August 2014, and today January 12, 2015 (4 mnths) my phone went completely blank. I have gotten no help with customer service and i&apos;m very, VERY upset! Either send me out a new one or i am filing a claim!!"	0
"I  received notice from AT&amp;T that the phone I had would no longer be supported after 7/30/14.  I was using a cheap small phone after my original Pantech took a dive in some water.  I am so happy with this phone.  When I called AT&amp;T to find out if this one would be supported (they were trying to lock me into 2yrs and a smartphone) they weren&apos;t sure.  It works great, love the size of the keyboard and very sharp looking."	1
I absolutely am in love with this phone. I love the features and camera. But I am heart broken that the battery life is very short if you are on your phone lot. Also this is my second v10. The 1st one over heated and would not turn back on. My second one is stuck in boot loop. 	0
"I absolutely love my Storm 2. Great for texting surfing the web as well as pictures. The part that I love the most is the fact that it&apos;s a great touch screen. So many applications and space for downloads. I had the Storm 1 first but had to sell it, loved the entire way the phone works so much that I decided to buy the Storm 2. Only negative thing I can say about the phone is that it does tend to freeze up quite a bit but, it&apos;s because it&apos;s a mini computer. You can literally do almost anything with this phone. :-D STORM 2 Rocks. You can also unlock the phone like I have and use it on any network. I myself, use the Storm on AT&amp;T. I&apos;m sure people are gonna ask why I feel this way, but, I&apos;d choose my Storm 2 over the new android systems as well as the iPhone. I even love how when you touch the screen it clicks so you know exactly what key your clicking."	1
"I absolutely love this phone! It came in perfect condition, exactly like the picture and with all the things (like the headphones, charger ect.) that were listed! Great seller! :)"	1
"I absolutely love this phone. The full keyboard is great; really easy to use, and has a great level of sensitivity. I don&apos;t have web on my phone plan, but should I ever get it, I wouldn&apos;t need to buy a new phone, which is great. It&apos;s good for really simple plans, as well as extensive ones. No big, clunky phone that I have to clip to my belt with the power of God for me. This phone is smaller, but still really effective."	1
"I actually bought two phones from E bay that day and when i got them they were both badly beat up. One worked for about a month and the other didn&apos;t ring or vibrate at all from the day I got it. It was, for lack of a better way to put it, a huge waste of money and I will think twice about purchasing anything used from E bay again."	0
I ALMOST DIDN&apos;T GET MY MONEY BACK ON THIS IT HAD TO MUCH DAMAGE ON IT HAD TO PART OUT. TO BREAK EVEN.	0
i already have one and it really was a good buy 4 the money and i look 4ward 4 my husband to use his new phone thanks in advance	1
I always buy LG to begin with.. But this is my first Android and I LOVE it!!! Its pretty easy to figure out and has lots of features!! The battery last for quite awhile as long as your not playing games and such!! I use it quite a bit with text and checking facebook and only charge it at night time!! I like it alot!	1
"I am a Blackberry user even though I have a Droid, the blackberry was designed with the business class in mind and still allowed us to have fun with the phone.The many applications makes whatever you need to do with this phone an easy snap."	1
"I am a senior person and the LG Chocolate is soooo easy to use. It has simplicity, style &amp; looks cool. I really like the fact that it locks when not in use automatically. It has voice command and comes with 2 different colored backs.  I had looked for a year for a new phone and then met a lady that owned a LG Chocolate and she sold me on it. It is the easiest phone to use and a joy to own."	1
"I am an oldster and do not text so I cannot comment on that aspect of using this phone, however, I can say that I have praised this phone several times to my Wife and relatives on how easy it is for me to use.  We are not heavy users of cell phones and only use them when needed but in the past I have had lots of trouble with other phones in picking up when someone calls or simply getting them to register my finger. Unlike the other person that left a review, I have not had to use a stylus with this phone.    This phone is larger than my past phones and that also is an advantage to us older folks who do not have the best vision.  I see now the price is $30 less than what I paid. Not sure if this is a limited time sale or not but I would urge anyone, especially those who are older like me to take advantage of this sale, this is an incredible price and getting a years worth of service and minutes to boot is an incredible bargain!  And No, I am not an employee of Tracfone and No I have not been paid to leave this review."	1
I am delighted with my IPhone 5. It is  in excellent condition and everything the ad said it would be. And they were also kind enough to even include a charge and a case. Happy me!	1
"I am ebay challenged.When I got the phone I bought the camera didn&apos;t work and it was a month sending it back and getting the replacement. I now have the phone and it is great.    When I got a bracelet it got lost and the seller has needed to file for insurance thru Pay Pal. I am still waiting for my refund.     I am kind of scared to try it again, I&apos;m sure you can understand.  Thank You."	0

I am looking to buy another 1 of these phones to replace mine that roommate dropped in the pool. I have yet to find a flip phone that has VOICE READOUT FEATURE. When a call comes in IT VERBALLY TELLS ME WHO IT IS (if in my phone book) or VERBALLY TELLS ME THE NUMBER CALLING. I don&apos;t have tpo stop what I&apos;m doing to SEE who calling. Thereb are not enough ring tones to assign all in my phone book. Just listen to who is calling. I&apos;m am soooo hard on phones my friends say I need a GI Joe combat zone field pack. It has lasted me 2+ years. Thats a tough phone. If your busy busy busy GET THIS PHONE. Mary Peterson Orangevale CA	1

I am really enjoying this phone. 	1
I am reviewing the seller instead of the Pixel 2.  I was unable to use the phone with Sprint so CDMA it wasn't.  And the seller choose NOT to communicate so eBay WAS wonderful!	0
I am so happy there are loyal honest businessmen out there. I was recently ripped off by another ebay person. And just when i lost all hope in doing business on ebay this company came through. They are so great as to going above and beyond your expectaions. Thank you again for THE GREAT SERVICE. it was such a pleasure doing business with you and i cant wait to do business again. Thank you	1

I am thr one who bid 999. I want to buy it but it doesn't ship to india.  Then whats the point in winning the bid...!	0
I am using this phone for parts because when I tried to load it I couldn't. I was told the phone was never scanned at the store where it was originally sold. Probably it was stolen or fell of the back of a truck. Either way its very disappointing. I would never buy from this source again.	0
"I am very disappointed. The pone is great but the phone that you sell is not what you offer. It is made for at &amp; t and not with the NOKIA logo (the picture you show is a lie), plus the battery cover is not the original, comes with scratches and the camera too. This phone is worn or altered. Finally, the &quot;Internet Sharing&quot; is locked and can not be used."	0
I am very happy with my purchase.  Seller responded quickly to my questions.  Thank you for the good experience!   	1
I am very happy with the purchase. 	1
I am very pleased about my new cell phone. Seller did good job in updating the status. the whole transaction was smooth.	1
I am very sad about the phone I recently receive because the phone was used and the chargeur doesn&apos;t work even the memory card support was broke.   so up to now I don&apos;t even used the phone and don&apos;t know what to do with...	0
I am very sorry about this review. However I am not able to give you any information as the item was never received and although I chose the item because it was a good phone that I had the opportunity to try and want to use but it was never received.	0
"I and a few friends have been using this phone for years.  We love it.  Small, elegant, metal case, easy to use.  It is perfect for voice and text.  None of us use it for Wi-Fi or Bluetooth; the screen is small.  The only occasionally negative reviews suggest the touchscreen is fragile.  I broke mine after 4 years.  So, I ordered a new phone, and 2 replacement touchscreens at 9 bucks each, and 2 replacement batteries at 5 bucks each.  I'm all set."	1
"I asked about the general info regarding to this cell phone before bidding, but seller just replied that there&apos;s no scratches on the monitor, however, he didn&apos;t say anything about scratches on each corner of the bottom and one at the back.That&apos;s why I think he just used it about 3 months and it&apos;s almost new, then I decided to buy it even at a high price. When I received the item, I asked him about it, he said he did tell me every detail of the item. So I asked him to forward those messages to me to review, coz I didn&apos;t find any words he described to me in the previous messages. After it, I waited about 4 days, he never reply me again, I don&apos;t know whether it&apos;s because he couldn&apos;t show me any or he just want to ignore my communication with him, then I leave a negative feedback to him. I think it&apos;s really unfair for me to get a negative feedback. Because from my previous feedback you can see I am a very serious and responsible buyer."	0
"I asked the seller specifically if this phone worked with AT&amp;T. The seller stated that the phone had been tested with an AT&amp;T sim card. When I received the phone, it showed that I had no network service available. I contacted AT&amp;T customer service support. They stated that the phone I purchased will not work with AT&amp;T. I am very unsatisfied with the sellers lack of cooperation in resolving this matter. I am also upset that the seller lied to me to get me to purchase the phone. I will NEVER recommend this seller, if anything I would recommend not purchasing anything this seller has to offer. An untruthful seller is not a person you want to purchase an item from!!!!!"	0
I basically use it for phone and text. it is functional very good.	1
"I believe the seller was overly cautious when he/she described the condition of this phone.  It was in excellent condition.  I have been using it for several days now and everything works great.  This is my fourth (4th) Razr V3 and I hope to stock up on some used or refurbished ones so I&apos;ll always have one to use.  I have dropped these phones and even got one of them wet and they still work. The newer phones don&apos;t compare to the Razr V3.  I wish Motorola would bring them back out, just like the old ones."	1

I bought 2 cellphones from this seller but they were not unlocked as advertised. When I contacted the seller just to ask why they were not unlocked the replied was They were unlocked when we had them unbelievable; in other words he suggested we tempered with the devices like we are technology savvies.

"I bought a cell phone from this seller who stated that the phone was brand new and that he had only used it for two months and he switched carriers so he no longer needed it. Well, I went to activate the phone  at the Sprint store to find out the phone is still linked to another account and therefore they are unable to activate it and that there has been water damage to the phone. Plus, It took over a week and a half to receive the phone that I cannot use. I emailed the person twice afterward asking him to take the phone off of his account and or refund me and needless to say there has been no response. I would NEVER buy anything from this seller again!!!! I was completely scammed!!!"	0
"I Bought a Huawei Mate 8 from this supplier from UK. They sent me wrong charger for UK use. I found terrible service, ignorant customer service.

i bought a phone from these people Because the reviews were decent however when I receive the phone it did not want to work and I had to put my own sim in it and it still did not want to work they are lucky samsung is willing to fix it for free.

"I bought a Samsung SGH Memoir T929 and I am very impressed by the quality of pictures that you can take with this phone, also is very useful when trying to surf the web and when using the Internet to check my emails.  I got this phone because the camera, and I am very pleased wit it."	1
"I bought an additional NEC 525 HD, as a back up of my two existing phones (one is my wifes&apos;).  After three years, the batteries still carriy a 4-day charge (down from 6) and they work great on the AT&amp;T Wireless / Cingular / back to AT&amp;T Wireless network.  The only thing that is not up to date is the lack of a mini SD card slot (can not increase storage), and does not take video (only pictures).  Other than that it is a great phone, and with the data cable and supplied software you can sync with your computer.  Also you can surf the internet / text message / e-mail / instant messenger."	1
"I bought an iphone 8 plus and before buying it I asked the seller if it come with a charger and he said yes, besides that it took a while to get the phone and without the cable, I sent him a message and said he would send it but never came."	0

I bought it and when its its arrived i was so happy to see it looks like brand new Iphone. Then after  month silence button and touch pad is not working and phone is not charging too . then sent to apple center they said bunch of parts are third parties so they ask me where am i going to repair it or recycle it? cause its gonna cost me almost 300 dollar . then i recycled it	0
"I bought it because I needed a new one. I selected this brand and model based in the information published in media.  The most I love of my new cell is the camera, it is fantastic. The touch screen is very sensitive and sometimes when I am making a call the earring activated other functions.  I am very happy with my cell but I think that when I will buy another I will buy newest model, technology evolutes faster than feelings."	1
"I bought it because it was 3G and supposedly &quot;unlocked&quot;. Well it&apos;s NOT unlocked, the features are not as user friendly as the older 2G version but otherwise I am thrilled with the HTC Dash 3G. Thethers perfectly to my macbook!"	1

"I bought it for my son,because i already had one.The one i had i was very impressed because of the features ,before android and iPhone became popular.The phone has front chat camera,but in the USA wasn&apos;t working because of the providers service.Very good Walkman player with clear voice and 8 GB internal memory.                                            Wasn&apos;t easy to get a good headphones for it and connector port after like 2 year of use became loose. If you like the music and need just the regular email check ,and don&apos;t care about Youtube and touch screen,that is a good compact cell phone.                                                The phone where i bought on Ebay i can&apos;t use,because it is locked to UK provider...So be sure if it&apos;s unlocked before you buy..."	1
"I bought it to play music in my shop via my WIFI.  It does work, but some of the apps I wanted are  incompatible, plus the ones that do work keep stopping and having to be restarted.  Not really good for this use.  Be wary, the phone started locking up and having to be restarted (remove battery, disconnect charger).  I returned it within the allotted period and was charged a $4.00 (25% of item price) restocking fee for a faulty item, plus Ebay charged a $4.30 shipping fee."	0

BE VERY CAREFULL WHEN ORDERING ANYTHING OFF HERE."	0

"I bought one of these in February 2015 and it worked like a champ till August 2016 when the battery started dying early, screen went white.  I decided to keep it as another little device for maps, camera, etc.  Bought another LG Optimus from eBay, $26.95 with shipping.  This one holds a battery charge for 24 hours and dies.  Screen has often gone white.  Notified the seller, he said it's up to Tracfone to back up the warranty.  Notified Tracfone and they said they do not honor warranties from sellers on eBay and such, very sorry.  I'll keep it for the rare times I use a phone and keep the charger handy.  Actually, 18 months for the first one isn't a great deal, even though the phone was only $20.  There's enough junk in land fills to keep from adding junk like these phones."	0

I bought the blackberry and it was delivered immediately.  I would do business with them again any time.	1
"I bought the E71 about 3 weeks ago after looking at the iPhone and a couple of Nokia&apos;s N series devices.  It&apos;s my first smartphone and I&apos;m struggling a bit with the size over my previous small LG flip phone.  It still fits easily in my pocket.  There is no comparison in functionality with my old phone.  I&apos;m still configuring Mail for Exchange but everything else I&apos;ve tried works quickly and easily.  Transferring my sim from my old phone was a breeze.  The phone was working within minutes of its delivery to my house.  I lost some information when I transferred contacts from my old phone memory to the sim but that could have been user error and doesn&apos;t impact my impression of the E71.    Battery life is excellent.  My old phone needed to be charged every night and sometimes during the day.  The E71 lasted over an entire weekend of use without a charge.  I can probably make it through overnight business trips without the charger.    I had no trouble adjusting to the keyboard and can (finally) send text messages without impacting my blood pressure.  I was never able to master text entry from a phone keypad.    I&apos;ve connected it to my home wifi and to one at my office.  I&apos;ve used wifi and 3G to get to gmail and several websites.  The view is a bit different from my 24&quot; monitor but it works pretty well.    You might want to spend some time with a symbian manual or guide before purchase.  Getting full use from the phone does require some investigation and knowledge of the OS.  I suspect I&apos;ll be learning how to use it&apos;s features for some time.  My son owns an iPhone and I have to say that interface seems easier and more intuitive.  However, I&apos;m very happy with the E71 for my use."	1
I bought the item because it was a messaging phone and I thought it would be a good phone for my son to start out with. Unfortunately the item will not send or receive text messages at all. Also the call quality is not great either. Could barely hear the person on the other end and the same for them.	0
"I bought the Motorola i860 Sprint Phone as a Chrostmas gift for my husband.  It arrived in early January 2011.  Although the phone has great features such as camera, video camera, and speakerphone, etc, it&apos;s batter lifespan is not very good.  If it is left one all day, even if not used, it generally requires charging every 24 hours.  However, even worse than that is that we bought it for it&apos;s supposed ruggedness and in less than two weeks, the screen on the phone quit working.  The display is like looking at a cracked mirror.  The advertisement for the phone leads one to believe it to be similar to the Timex watch whose saying is &quot;It takes a licking but keeos on ticking&quot;.  My husband dropped this phone on our dirt driveway, and this was the result.  Ebven his old Motorola took more of a lickoing than this one.  This phone is definitely &quot;cracked up&quot; and not as durable as advertised."	0
"I bought the New Phone 2 weeks ago and was  impressed with the number of features available on this inexpensive phone. The NewPhone&apos;s size is perfect for carrying in a pocket and the battery has a pretty good lifespan of roughly 3 days. My only complaint is that it is a little slow when going into settings or the menue. Other phones I&apos;ve owned have quicker menus and get you to important features easily. Overall, I&apos;d recommend the phone if you&apos;re on a budget. All in all the phone is great for not having to commit to another contract with AT&amp;T. Perfect for now. Thanks."	1
"I bought the NewPhone 8530 three weeks ago and was immediately impressed with the number of features available on this inexpensive phone. It has a 2M-pixel camera, video camera, and speakerphone. The NewPhone&apos;s size is perfect for carrying in a pocket and the battery has a pretty good lifespan of roughly 4 hours. My only complaint is that the menu system on the phone makes you click four times before you can find someone in the address book, set an alarm, or perform a additional functions. Other phones I&apos;ve owned have simpler menus and get you to important features easily. Overall, I&apos;d recommend the phone if you&apos;re on a budget."	1

"I bought the NokiaE75 because the phone has integrated Wifi, keyboard, radio, excellent camera and a cell phone is very precious."	1
I bought the phone and then sold it again.  When I got the phone it had old phone numbers and other information from the previece owner.  I could have taken it to a Nextel dealer but there is not one close to my home and that is such a pain in the butt.  It was kindof hard to use not like a regular cell phone.  The over all rating is a 4 out of 10.	0
"I bought the phone because I was unfamiliar with androids, and this phone was the least expensive.  It is a great little starter phone for anyone who has never had an android.  Everything is easy to use and figure out, but I don&apos;t like the fact there is no instrucion book so you have to go online to check out the features.  However, it seems to be the trend now to not have instruction books included, so this is still a great phone for the money."	1
"I bought the phone for a Christmas gift. The packaging looks good, received the phone really quick. I didn&apos;t open the phone because it is a gift, but I feel confident it will be in good working order. I also got the phone at a good price. I would deal with this seller again."	1
"I bought the phone for the mp3 player and camera, but I am already not happy with it and am fixing to buy a new phone from cingular.

"I bought this as an upgrade from the Galaxy S-Mesmerize. This phone has a larger, brighter screen. The screen also recognizes touch  better than the Galaxy S. This phone also has a much better camera that can take pictures from the back of the phone and also front-facing."	1
"I bought this board; it arrived quickly (I'll give him that). When I started connecting it up to the phone, I noticed the WIFI antenna jack was missing from the board; I'm not going to accept a board that doesn't support WIFI, so I didn't even bother testing it further, there may have been other things wrong with it as well. I contacted him and explained, but he didn't want to deal with me. At first he didn't even understand what I said (or was playing dumb) and then he starts coming up with all kinds of excuses (some that don't even make sense), hoping that I would just go away. Getting him to take responsibility for the sale was like pulling teeth! I opened a case and he claimed that I tampered with the board and he refuses to take it back. Meanwhile, HIS OWN PICTURE IN THE AUCTION clearly shows that the jack is in fact missing!!!! Look for yourself; don't take my word for it. Ebay wound up ruling in my favor (Thank you Ebay!!).  I see someone else bought a logic board from this guy and left bad feedback, calling him a fraud. I didn't know what had transpired between him and his buyer because the space they give you to type is too small. Sometimes the buyer is the problem; perhaps they broke something and claimed it was broken to get another one free by taking advantage of the "	0
I bought this cell phone to replace another AT&amp;T Phone. This works only on the old AT&amp;T. Not what is available now. Now who has the old AT&amp;T? No one! Everyone pretty much upgraded. Luckily the seller refunded me. But I wasted all that money and I have to borrow my dad&apos;s phone until we get Verizon. Which is real soon! I can&apos;t wait!	0
"I bought this expensive phone for easy usage of the both SIMs.  It had a hardware fault, the 3G SIM (WCDMA) was not constantly on.It intermittently goes off and on and I am not able to get phone calls or data on that SIM. Now I returned to the seller for the repair. Bad experience for me unfortunately."	0
I bought this for my daughter and she loves it. Nice and sleek with a pretty turquoise strip running around the phone. No problems with the phone.	1
"I bought this for my husband, and he is satisfied with it! So I think it is worthy of being recommended to our friends."	1
"I bought this Galaxy Note 3 used. It was in perfect condition, like it was never used. No charger. No ear plugs. Just a phone in it's original box. It was a Verizon phone and that was the only hitch. I use SIM cards for portability and choice. The Verizon version comes with GSM capability as well as their CDMA technology. Adding a SIM card from another vendor causes problems that can be rectified if you know how to do it. The internet has more than a few videos to help so it wasn't a show stopper. I still haven't tried to remove all the Verizon apps but once I get used to it, I'll start purging their bloatware. I'm going to get another one, this one for me. It will be the AT&T or T-Mobil version, that's how much I like the phone. I used a EBay $25 coupon to offset the cost. Great buy."	1
I bought this iPhone Friday and buyer has not contacted me since I think it's a scam. He still bidding on the phone when it's bought already.	0
"i bought this item beacause i persumed that this is part of some samsung marketing strategy, that they offers cool new phones for low prices and they making a good picture for themselves. this was very interesting. in the end this is just a fraud.  thanks to ebay for solving this problem so quickly. :)"	0
I bought this item for Christmas. I did not realize the item had been cancelled. Now I have to order another item and try to get it here for Christmas. Very unhappy!	0
I bought this item thinking it was in good shape I started reading lower on the page and it says the screen is cracked on the photo it was turned over not even showing the screen how fraudulent is that?	0
"I bought this motherboard because my gs3 would not accept a charge due to a damaged micro USB charge port. When this replacement came and I swapped out my old board for this new one, I was pleased at the fact that it was able to charge again. However, when I tried to make a phone call, I can hear the other person answer clearly, but they cannot hear me. Just some weird alien-like sounds going on. So obviously there is a problem with this motherboards audio receiver. I also tried swapping this board with multiple other gs3s and had the same problem. No returns accepted from seller, even though item is described as working, but in reality, it does not..."	0
I bought this Palm because I like the brand its so professional. The only thing I think may go wrong with this phone maybe the touch-screen as do most touch-screen phones. This phone is awesome and unlike iphone it doesn&apos;t seem like everyone has one because they are so complex.	1
I bought this phone 4-5 weeks ago.. I am very satisfied with the quality of product. Very nice product in a give price.	1
"I bought this phone about 7 months ago. The biggest problem I have had was battery life. After being fully charged, battery only lasts about 2 days. If phone is used more than normal, battery has to be charged daily! I tried to buy a new battery for phone but found it impossible to get as phone was not made for U.S. market. Sound quality is so-so and it is not user friendly as far as feature usage. All in all, I would say stay away from Siemens and go with Motorola or Nokia."	0
"I bought this phone after my daughter got a BLU 5.0 phone.  I was very impressed by the features compared to the very competitive cost.  Well, now that I have mine, I LOVE it.  It is essentially a Samsung Galaxy at less than half the cost.  It is well built, easy to set up, unlocked so readily aligns to any provider service, and has a great display.    I especially like the 5.5 inch screen.  Several of my friends first teased me about how big it was compared to their I-phones, androids, etc.  But after playing with it a bit, seeing the display, holding in their hand for call, and playing a few games, all have come away with &quot;phone envy.&quot;  IMHO, this size is the perfect balance between easy-to-carry phone and a tablet-sized display for reading, watching videos, looking at photos, etc.  While wide, it&apos;s thin, and easily fits in any shirt pocket or pants pocket I want to carry it.  I also bought a belt case/carrier with a metal clip to hold it while I&apos;m at the gym and it works perfectly, too.  So far, the battery life is OK.  It comes with a 2250mAh battery that will take me through most of the day with moderate to heavy use.  I use it as a GPS unit (with the WAZE app) in the car and charge it while driving.  Mine came with a screen protector.  In the past, I generally toss these screen protectors in the trash for other phones/tablets.  Well, I gave this a try and it went on great, has crystal clarity, and has functioned very well.  I also purchased a hard-plastic shell/case.  This has worked superbly, comes on and off easily for cleaning, and shows no cracks or dings even though I have accidentally dropped the phone a couple of times.  I have not used the dual-SIM feature, but I think it would be very handy for anybody who does a lot of business on their phone while wanting to keep their personal number private -- it essentially gives the option to have two phone in one unit."	1
I bought this phone and it doesn&apos;t work!    I spent $180.00 !  Im Requesting a refund.  I&apos;m not sure what the problem is!  The phone will not charge or show any signs of coming on.  I tried a new charger and it still didn&apos;t work!	0
I bought this Phone and straight talk said it was stolen watch out they keep on telling me they couldn&apos;t do anything about this.	0
I bought this phone as a gift for my boyfriend. He likes that it&apos;s a all touchscreen phone and have good apps. It is one of the top smartphones for Verizon.	1
"I bought this phone as a replacement for my son&apos;s Cingular cell phone.  I love this Phone because it was originally for AT&amp;T wireless (but has been unlocked)therefore the phone can be used for Cingular or T-Mobile but will not allow a conncetion to the internet, hence no downloading or net surfing. Its perfect for simply talking and text messaging.  Plus the small design easily fits in a pocket, and the slider feature is cool!"	1
"I bought this phone as my first android phone, and I LOVE IT!!! It has an ultra-responsive and durable screen, and i love the qwerty keyboard!!!    Pros - great touchscreen, responsive touchscreen, many free apps ANDROID!    Cons - none (to me)"	1
"I bought this Phone because I had just purchased a new battery for my old C2000. Worked pretty good for a while then the the phone and the charger started not connecting to each other very well.  About 2 weeks of positioning the phone just right to take a charge, it stopped charging totally."	0
"I bought this phone because I needed a phone fast, because mine had broken. It was a little on the expensive side, but I thought maybe that would be better, and the product would have a better quality. This is the WORST phone I have EVER OWNED, it drops calls constantly, and when the call does go through, the person on the other end can not understand you. I would not recommend this phone to anyone EVER."	0
"I bought this phone because I was disappointed with my Nokia Windows phone. I wanted an inexpensive phone and was willing to forego bleeding edge technology. But I expected good basics: decent voice quality, reasonable memory, and at least a work day's work of battery life. This phone falls short.   Voice quality is ok using the earpiece, but on speaker it's tinny. There's very little memory, so don't plan on downloading many apps, and there's not much room for multitasking. The real Achilles heel, for me, is the abysmal battery life. Ten hours is about it if you let it roam with data turned on. That's ridiculous. After a few days I assumed it came with a bad battery so bought a new LG oem unit. It made no difference.  My SIM card is back in my Nokia. I like it better now."	0
I bought this phone because it looked like a nice phone.After getting it I was dissapointed because it looks like a cheap toy phone.It is made of plastic not metal.The price is to much for a phone like this.	0
"I bought this phone because my girlfriend broke her phone but was not eligible for a discount on a new one.  Unfortunately, this phone was stolen and cannot be activated.  the seller assumes no responsiobility for this, and i am still waiting on the paypal investigation surrounding this incident.  it is a shame that people like this give ebay and paypal such a bad rep."	0
"I bought this phone because of its features,its quality of the best phone in the market also its value for the money,I recommend it as the best phone you can get."	1
"I bought this phone before and I liked it alot, it worked very well and was fast. the android network is the way to go for sure."	1
I bought this phone for a family member that leads a very active lifestyle. This is a very durable solid feeling phone. It is very simple to use and was quite a bargain!	1
I bought this phone for my boyfriend because he just can&apos;t leave the chirp and flip phones alone.  It&apos;s a great phone and he couldn&apos;t be happier. I didn&apos;t pay that much for it either which made me happy.	1
"I bought this phone for my daughter for her birthday.  We went to turn it on and, the metro pcs dealer told us the box and the phone code numbers we not the same. He also told us the phone was unable to turn on because it has a open line.  The dealer gave me a big hard time with this phone.  Thanks to E Bay I got my money returned to me.  Never again would I deal with this dealer!"	0
I bought this phone for my father. He's not so high tech. But this phone really done it. It is brand new with out packaging box but whatever. The box was getting thrown away anyways. Nothing I can say but the phone works great and performs as it should.	1
I bought this phone for my grandson for Christmas and was very pleased with the condition and appreciate the fast shipment.  Great to do business with!	1
"I bought this phone for my husband who works outside.  He wanted to replace his old TracFone with a more rugged one.  I was very careful to read the disclosure at the bottom that stated it was compatible with TracFone.  Well, it isn't, and I can no longer find the disclaimer.  It is a great looking phone.  Just be careful about your carrier.  I was misled.  I'm going to try to return it.  Wish me luck."	0
I bought this phone for my sister but the phone never worked. I contacted the seller but he never responded. I opened a case with eBay and the seller immediately started responding. He promised me to send me a replacement cell phone provided I close the case. I did close the case but the seller never kept his promise. He never sent me anything and had not replied to a single mail of mine ever since.   Overall I had a very poor experience. Please avoid buying anything from this seller.	0
"I bought this phone for my son. So far, he loves it. His previous phone was a Samsung Galaxy 2. This is a nice phone with a fast processor. This is probably the best Windows phone out right now. It is a really good value."	1
i bought this phone for my wife she finds it easy to use and it was cheap works good on my straight talk plan	1
"I bought this phone for one of my granddaughters. She adores the phone , she tells me it is just the right size for her. She has not had any problems.    I would have no qualms on buying another one if one of my other grandaughters wanted one."	1
"I bought this phone from a member that only had 3 transactions-I was a little leery, but that was unfounded. It is a great phone and the seller responded immediately about a question that I had. Top Shelf!"	1
I bought this phone in August right before I went back to school. This phone was in great condition. I am very pleased!! Also thank you for the fast deleviry.	1
"I bought this phone new when it came out years ago. For me it is the perfect phone. I learned it so that I can operate it to make phone calls on the go with one hand. So when TMobile stopped offering it as a replacement, I found this one on the EBay. And now I know if I need to replace it again I know where to find another one. And I definately will get another one."	1
I Bought This Phone Refurbished by a top seller its junk. battery life didnt last and now it wont start up beyond the verizon wireless intro when turning on.... DO NOT MAKE THIS MASTAKE..DONT BUY THIS PHONE..	0
I bought this phone thinking it would be better than the old Samsung Note4 but it is no better!  Battery life stinks and when I got the phone I think it was already used.  It had another phone number associated with it and I kept getting charged for that line until I could get it straightened out with Verizon. I honestly do not think the phone works correctly.  I would not buy another one.  	0
I bought this phone to have a nice flip phone to use.  Perfect match......I hope to keep it for years!	1
"I bought this phone to replace my current Nokia 6500 slide.  Unfortunately, the new phone does not work.  The battery is fully charged and it won&apos;t turn on. The front sliding piece is on crooked. It did not come in a Nokia box, but in a ML Royal S3588 box, so I am not even sure if it is new as advertised.  Also, no software was included.  I know how to work this kind of phone because I love the one I already have.  I am very disappointed and won&apos;t buy from this seller again."	0
"I bought this phone to use in the UK on a trip in July 2011.  When I installed the Sim card, the phone did not work at all.  It was an extremely disappointing experience. A complete waste of money."	0
"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE USED OFF EBAY. WAS GUARANTEED TO BE A GREAT PHONE. QUAD BAND, UNLOCKED, WORLD PHONE ETC. BUT WHEN I INSTALLED MY MX TELCEL SIM CARD, IT WONT READ IT. THE PHONE WONT HOLS A CHARGE. HOPE OTHER PEOPLE HAVE BETTER LUCK THEN ME. MAY JUST BE THIS ONE PHONE. HOPE SO...."	0
I bought this primarily because it works on CDMA/ Verizon. The most common Net 10 phones are ATT/ GSM which has terrible reception in my area. Net 10 will not sell the C phones unless you live in a few/ limited zip codes. If all you need is a plain phone it is OK. Net 10 is goood as long as you do not have to go through their customer service. Net 10 will transfer minutes if you are on a monthly plan.	0
I bought this product because i had previously owned one and really liked it! The only thing i didnt like was that it got heated up pretty quick but that was the first edition not the second one like this one is.	1
"I bought this product because it had all the features for which I was looking in a smart phone; a large 4.5 screen, wifi, access to the internet, easy to use and access to the App Store.  The seller was beyond helpful and cooperative.  There are newer phones with larger screens, but the Infuse is big enough and with 4G capability, really fast."	1
"I bought this product cause I needed to upgrade may phone and this phone had everything that I needed. I have no complaints about the phone, but i love it."	1
I bought this product from the buyer and he never sent me anything and took my money. Ebay did nothing to resolve the issue.	0
I bought this product with intentions of using it before I die. Still no product in the mail 22 days after purchasing it.	0
"I bought this several weeks ago. But the 30 day free service is not included as advertised. Then I opened a case with ebay. After a long meaningless investigation by ebay, my case was closed without any explanation. Stay away from this company. And most importantly, stay away from ebay, the most garbage company!!!"	0
I bought this to replace my daughters phone.  Hers cracked and this was cheaper than buying a new screen.  works great  so far.    she just got it and is still working out the kinks of learning this phone	1

I can not use this phone because the seller sold me a locked phone. It will not even work with a Cingular sim card. It will not work with any sim card. It is a paper weight. it is totally useless to me.	0
i can&apos;t even put the phone to use.  it rejects my sim cards. it does not charge. i had to to give the phone a zero grade.	0
I can&apos;t speak for all Galaxy S vibrant phones but this one had been tampered with and it made my voice unintelligable to the people on the other end. It did not have sound for turning on and turning off. My Galaxy S 4G was stolen and I tried to save money by buying this online. The Galaxy S 4G is a great phone and just bought a new one yesterday at the Tmobile store. Just beware buying electronics online.	0
"I cann&apos;t write about it because I have received counterfeit phone. Features of counterfeit phone: on a box all is written correctly, on phone too. But SIM the back cover doesn&apos;t get also opens its moving without untwisting of screws.  Be careful of fakes. At once check phone at reception."	0
I cannot really answer any of these questions as the phone never worked properly and I am returning to seller. 	0
"i can't believe my luck with his phone, so far it works perfect so it has a cracked display it;s so hard to see i don;t notice it till i run my finger over crack. other then that phone looks in brand new condition if it last a long time i will be SUPER TRILLED YA YA YA !!!!!!!!!! will see in a couple of months how that goes. THANKS AGAIN CELLDAYS FOR A GREAT EXPERIENCE shopping with you."	1
I cant put my sim card. If I put my SIM card it asked me code. 	0
I changed my mind and got a better deal and wanted a refund and he only gave me half of the refund 	0
"I chose this phone because I am familiar with Windows and Microsoft. I am a senior with a lot of learning ahead. I found it easy to set up and understand; co-ordinated with my Surface and PC. Because it is my first, I can't compare to any other product."	1
I contacted the seller before purchase to make sure that this phone would work with my Verizon plan. (Not prepaid). They assured me it would. I bought the phone and Verizon could not activate it. I contacted the seller again for a refund. They wanted to keep 30% as a restocking fee. Never buy from these people.	0
I could not even turn it on. My worst eBay experience ever.	0
"I couldn&apos;t be any happier with my phone! I love it! It is a great phone, easy to use and reliable! I am one happy camper! Thank you!"	1
"I couldnt tell you about the product, it was never received.  After payment was taken from my bank account, an email was sent saying the sender had cancelled the transaction.  To this day, there has been no reimbursement, and still no product."	0
i decide to buy it cuz the seller said that the phone was on worker condition that nothing was wrong with the phone but once i got the phone i tried to charger it didn&apos;t charge so i though it was the battery so got a new one still the same so i took the phone to the sprint store they said that the phone was bad that they couln&apos;t fixed lucky i got insurance they replace the phone otherwise i would it be screw becarefully with this seller BEWARE!!!!!!!	0
I decided to buy it because I also have this same phone at home.  It was an awful experience with a fraudulant seller.It did&apos;nt work.  Returned it!!It was probably resold!	0
I decided to buy the phone as a replacement phone for my husband. Nowhere in the phone discription did it say the phone did not need a smartcard. Any AT&amp;T customer knows that all the phones now have to have a card and this phone does not require one so basically I WASTED my money and time on this purchase because I can not even use it.	0
i decided to buy this phone because i had broke my other phone. I did not like this new phone the LG VX6000 at all. When I would talk on it I had to ues an ear piece because the mic on the phone was broken and no one could hear me. Also the phone would randomly shut off and i would have service and would still not be able to place a call or recive. I was not impressed with his phone at all. I have only owed the phone for a month and dont even use it anymore because off how poor it worked.	0
i decided to buy this phone because of it&apos;s features plus it looks good. but when i received it and opened the box the phone looked little old because it had wearing signs. it wasnt good as new. now the camera turns on by itself and phone becomes unlocked by itself. it seems like the phone has malfunction problem.	0
I decided to buy this stove to try and cut down on my heating bills. I am so happy I chose this seller he is very honest if you cant get ahold of him leave a message and he returns you calls right away. I am so pleased. Item was exactly as stated. You can not go wrong with this seller   very trust worthy. Thank you for amazing ebay sellers like yourself!!	1

"I did get a this just because I did not wanted to buy an unknown screen replacement  just did not trust any of them, so I  got this instead and removed the perfectly working original screen for my phone and on the top of that if I happened to need anything else I have it! So yes it was a bargain ."	1
"I did not check immediately after i got it,but as soon i could i unpacked and tried to charge the battery that came with.For some reason,while charging ,on top left of the screen a light came on,which shows a failure of some kind,and also the phone will warm up.Being afraid of maybe an explosion like some previous models,getting in fire,i did took a picture of the screen with the light on,sent to the seller,and did not got a response.After that i purchased another battery OEM,put this one in ,charged again,and during the charging again the red light on the top left came on.I wrote again to the seller and explaining ,and ask him for a refund.Of Course he did not say anything. After that i took the phone to a place where they fix phones, for a evaluation.They got into the phone,and found a shorth?? and told me that the phone it is defective,and to replace the parts will be 125.00 dollars. I decided not to fix it,and because the time went by i could not return it,so i decided to take a loss,and do not buy from this seller anything.Beside i left him at receiving a 5 star positive feedback,hopping that the cellphone will be ok.I made a mistake by doing that,he knew what he sold me, and as a result he did not leave me a feedback ,buying his defective phone made me think more about buyi"	0
I did not get the phone when I found out that you had to buy a plan with the phone. So when I thought that I was getting the phone at a really good price I was not getting a deal at all. And I would not buy from this person again.	0
"I did not like the fact that they only accepted same day payment, (which they got) no refunds only exchanges and once I got the phone the earpiece didnt work. The description said the phone had been tested and worked great. When I reached out to them to them let them know of the inconvenience this had caused me, they told me the phone had been tested twice before it got to me and asked me questions like I didnt know what I was doing. I explained to them I had a deadline however, this meant absolutely nothing them. Ill never do business with them again...terrible customer service."	0
"I did not like the phone, although there was nothing wrong with it functionaaly,it had too many scratches and looked too beat up.I purchase the phone for my daughter and now im planning on returning the phone and purchasing another phone."	0
I did not purchase this product.  I have att service and this was equiped with verizon.  Not sure who purchased this item or what happened.	0
"I did not receive the item I purchased.  Ebay provided a full refund - thank goodness!  I tried to contact the seller several times, but the seller would not respond to my emails.  I have NO idea why the item was never sent to me.  Personally, I recommend not buying or selling with this person."	0
"I did not receive this phone, hence no review. This is the second auction I won and the seller refunds my money for no reason that I was made aware of.    Thank you Ebay. I sure hope i will win an auction and then decide not to pay. That will fine with Ebay I hope."	0
I did receive this Samsung SGHA107 in a timely manner and I would definitely purchase another phone again.	1
"I didn&apos;t compare store prices because my husband&apos;s cell phone broke and I needed to replace it right away.  We live in a very rural area.  In the package when I received my purchase, there was a WalMart invoice for ABOUT HALF OF WHAT I PAID.  Seller scammed me and when I mentioned it to her she was extremely rude and basically laughed at me and called me an idiot.  For what it was worth (not much I&apos;m assuming), I reported her.  I&apos;m sure nothing came of it.  I have not purchased anything from Ebay since and am very reluctant to do so.  Seems Ebay has been taken over by retail sellers with nothing but greed as their motivation.  I now use BooCoo.com.  For the time being, it&apos;s just honest people like myself trying to sell/purchase items.  BEWARE EBAY&apos;ERS."	0
I didn&apos;t get the phone. Seller refunded the money after he  tested the iphone. I thought that was a new Iphone ! - After that I ordered one by Virgin mobile.	0
"I didn&apos;t really have any complaints on this phone. Always seemed to work. I got it becase my RAZR stopped working one day and I decided I wanted a smartphnone. It honestly performed very well. I mean technology has changed as all this used was EDGE service. It didn&apos;t have 3g and it was still fast. It was either a toss of keeping my current LG f9100 at the time or getting this, and i got this after only using the f9100 for about 1 month *(later returning to it after i got tired of data)*"	1
"I didn't actually purchase this product, however, because ""k-mart"" does not have an image of the screen of this phone on the listing, I asked him/her to send me an image of the phone's screen. And after much persistence he still has not sent an image of the screen. This leads me to believe the screen is scratched or damaged and the seller does not want to reveal it so he/she can sell the phone at full price."	0
"I didn't expect the battery life to be great because it's a used phone, and it's been about two years since Google first released this model. However, the phone would shut off anywhere between 95% and 20%. As it was shutting off, it said that the battery was at 0%, and the phone would refuse to turn back on (as though it actually didn't have any juices left). The phone was therefore unusable as it could shut off 5 min after unplugging from a full charge. Buyers, beware! This is apparently a common problem for Nexus users who had their phones for about 1-2 years."	0
"I didn't give the phone one star,  because it is a greasy phone.  My 80 year old blind Mom had used this exact model for about 4 years before hers failed.  My issue is with the seller.  I  did receive the phone quickly, but it was advertised as brand new yet it only had a phone and a charger ruling around in the box,  no book or anything. Here 's the fatal problem: When I called to activate the phone,  I found out that you can't activate that model anymore. I will be returning this. "	0
i didnt like the product its not what i expected i was disaoppinted now i have the phone sitting on my desk doing nothing and i can not sell it to someone else because i dont recommended. sorry	0
I didn't use the phone right away but when I did it worked great for a very short while. Then the phone died on me. I contacted the seller they said it was too late to return. I will never purchase from this seller again!	0
"I dislike that the item did not properly work, bought it because it seemed like a good deal at the time and i needed a gsm phone to travel to europe with."	0
"I dislike this because seller listed incorrectly.Stated a few minor scartches,which were major and battery charger had alot of what looked like blush powder were the contacts were."	0
i disliked the swivling camera because i fliped open the phone one day and the top snaped off. worst phone ive ever had.  i would recomend that u dont buy this phone unless ur SUPER gentle!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	0
I do like this phone but it is extremely slow and lags very bad....	0
"i do not know yet because i had ordered  this item but i never recieve   it. it has pass two months without news about it. i have pay for it but i did not recieve it .    I sent   mail  to seller 3 times  but he did not answer. please, help me because i do not know what can i do. thank you."	0
"i do not like this phone at all ;it does nothing,i expected more out of this phone,and i am not getting anything,my htc hd2 did more than this product by far,i have not been this disappointed since the razor phone,all i wanted was to video stream a live program,hd7 doesnot video stream(didnot know that),i am really not pleased at all"	0
"I do not recommend this seller because he is not honest with the state of the things he sells, he bought a new iPhone and it turned out that it was used. I tried to communicate with him and he never answered me."	0
I don&amp;apos;t using this phone because as today I don&amp;apos;t received this cellular. I paid in full and I want to know what happen because I need it.  I hope for your response as soon as possible.  Thanks.	0
I don&apos;t know never arrived. But I pay on a first second waiting long time I am disappointed. Of eBay sorry guys I go to nearest shop to by my needs. You took money without service where we go with that for me every dollar is important I making pizzas for living so thank you for bad service	0
I don&apos;t like the fact that within days of purchase the phone malfunctioned. My wife can&apos;t use the phone without using an ear piece. I bought it as a present to her. 59 bucks down the drain.	0
i don&apos;t no how to use this phone. very hard to use. i think the battery is good but then not sure. didn&apos;t use phone to long. couldn&apos;t figure it out.	0
"I don't greatly recommend this seller, but you can try to experience in your own. I bought 3 cellphone , they sent me phones that are different from the image and one without a battery. WHen I told them that, they sent me another battery but smaller. "	0
I dont know if i like it because i still haven&apos;t recieved it after waiting almost 3 weeks for something that should&apos;ve been here in 5 days	0
"I don't know what the deal is. I don't know if I got a defective phone or what. It is very slow, doesn't respond most of the time, there is a delay with the caller id when the phone rings (it takes about 10 seconds to show up), for calls and texts sometimes it is the number that shows instead of the name, battery has to be charged twice a day, and when watching a video on youtube or facebook it doesn't play right. The video will play a second and then stop, play a second and then stop. I am doing this on my laptop cause my phone was acting up while I was trying to do this on there. And also, when you restart the phone, any shortcut on the main screen disappears. Had to buy another phone as this one doesn't have all the settings needed for it to work properly with AT&T. Kept dropping my cell service "	0
i don't like this item because in this item are many issue.	0
I dont normally give review but this is one of the best phone dealers I've worked with. Worked with me 100% and in return I got a very good deal. You deserve this 5 star.	1
"I don't require much of a phone. I don't play games, etc....  This is a gorgeous phone with dual Sims and a nice form. HOWEVER...  It will barely run with only 3 tabs open. The screen is extremely frustrating, refusing to move at times, and then suddenly scrolling 20 pages at lightning speed. This phone will no doubt anger you if you are used to anything over 50 bucks.  Don't buy for the look. You get what you pay for...  This phone has an ""amazing quad core processor"" but the memory is severely underpowered and dated.  Maybe adequate 8 years ago. "	0
"I don't want to walk around with my face in my phone.  I go online at home on my computer.  I don't want to go online on my phone.  I want to text and make calls and just want a dependable phone that I'm not constantly having to download new updates just to keep it working, which is what I had to do with the i-phone I just got rid of.  This is a great, easy to use phone.  When the battery is charged it lasts for days.  I love it."	1
I emailed the guy at the email address given 3 times stating the phone does not work. Took it to Altel to hook it up the day it arrived..they said the buttons did not all work and it was water logged. So i emailed to see if i send it back will he return my 70.00??? No answer at all..I sent 3 emails. Because of this I will never order off ebay again. And I can not say a nice thing about this awful purchase either!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	0
I enjoy this phone a lot but the battery is a little messed up ... i ended up buyin replacements. Other than that i love it.	1
"I expected to get a good deal on this product. However, everything was wrong.  I true piece of crap. Do not buy from this person. Not reliable!!!!"	0
I feel that iPhone 6S plus was made right for me .  Very happy to ha one.   	1
i first bought the htc dash for my girlfriend as a [resent for valentines day and she really liked it and i got drawn into it. i decided to buy myself one and i got this for a really good price. thanks!	1
"I found out the phone this crook sold me for $40.00 retails for $12.99 at walmart and Best Buy.  Before i left negative feedback i contacted the seller and asked for a $10.00 refund because he totally ripped me off and the seller refused, then said i couldnt leave negative feedback because i threatened him by asking for a refund.  SHOP AROUND BEFORE BUYING FROM THIS SELLER !!!!! TOTAL CROOK!!!"	0
"i gave them a positive for the no hassle refund and good customer service. but their ads are inaccurate, they said i can use my old sim card on the new phone but it doesnt work. called the phone company directly to mail me a new card the next day."	0
"I give it a 5 star because it works good it's just to small for me because I can't see small words , letters  and numbers"	1
"I got a great phone at a great price I did not want to get locked in to my cell phone contract for two more years so I choose to purchase one from this seller, Phone works great shipped really fast and I will use this seller again"	1
"I got a very scratched phone, upon asking the seller for help with replacing a ""brand new"" broken up screen phone the seller did not reply to me,I waited and prayed I would get a response but nope nothing...I'm beyond upset I paid so much for a pre broken phone.My recommendation is to just save your time and money for a different seller unless you love getting junk."	0
I got exactly what i was expecting from  the reading the description. The product was properly packaged. I recommend this user for anyone!	1
"I got mine for $120 new, at that price point alone and looking at the market, there are not many phones to get, let alone compare to it, spec for spec.  The 3gb of ram and 32gb internal is not seen well into the $200 and above typically, and the camera while not class leading like it could and should have been, produces for me some very satisfying photos that beats ANYTHING in the sub $200 (Minus the Moto G5 Plus Amazon), here is a short run down of this phone:  Screen: I like the 5"" size and the IPS colors on it, really pops out and adequately bright.  Performance: This is no Galaxy S7 but this is snappy for daily tasks and just noticeable in more heavy tasks, I will not call this phone slow.  The 3gb ram ensures most if not all things remain open.  Battery life:  I saw many reviewers talk of ""abyssal"" performance but I can't think but good things about it, I can safely get 4 hours of screen on time under moderate to heavy tasks and if on average use, I can hit two days.  This to me is more than enough.  Camera: The big selling and focus point of this phone, it is no Galaxy S7, or iphone7, but this is still capable of great shots, my experience with video recording has not been too impressive, I say average, but the pictures can turn out good, and with some editing apps like Ado"	1
I got my new phone very quickly and customer service was great. It works like a charm! Thank you so so so much!	1
"I got one of these from my local Walmart to use with  Verizon. I thought when i got it a nice prepaid phone   for under 15 dollars. Boy was i wrong. The sound quality is poor, it goes straight to voicemail without  ringing and when you try to check voicemail it says invalid number, so to check voice mail you must dial the ole star 86. As a truck driver bluetooth is a must  with the new laws in effect, however it does not like   any bluetooth i have tried.I used a motorola h-700,a  blue parrott bt-250xt and the cobra 29 bluetooth cb.  If it pairs and you want to make the 2nd call it has   to be repaired.This is a major pain"	0
I got the first one in the mail the phone was bent and didn't turn on after hours of leaving it plugged in. They said the sent a replacement and gave me a tracking number but I never got the package. I just paid $70 for a bent broken phone.... 	0
I got the phone before the day I was expected it. Everything its great and according to the description. Phone works excellent  	1
"I got the phone in a FAIR amount of time, but the phone did not work at all. Two Sprint techs could not get the item to accept service.  On the website it stated I could return the phone with in 7 days. I returned the item the very next day. I have not gotten a refund OR a replacement."	0
I got the phone really fast but it turns out it is lost or stolen. So i cant use it untill the person says its not lost or stolen.	0
"I got this as an upgrade when I resigned for another contract. I found it more complicated to use for daily functions such as texting and pulling up contact info. The phone it replaced was a samsung slider phone, which though not a smart phone, was far superior to use and much better made. The screen was overly sensative at times, and yet was very difficult to accept an incoming call when trying  to unlock. Battery life is greatly reduced when on line to the point of needing your charger handy because it won&apos;t be long... A very frustrating problem was the keypad opperation. Most times it won&apos;t stay on screen long enough to input your selection for inputting codes or menu selections and you&apos;d have to shake the phone to get the screen to come back on. This would happen after a second or two and could not be compensated for by going into the settings mode to try to solve. The problem was intermiten and would often result in losing the call due to lack of input. Unfortunatly, mine suffered a fall from table top  level and broke into 3 pieces while hitting a carpeted floor. There were no protective rubber covers or holders for this phone available when I got it so I had no way to protect it. Everyone has dropped their phone at one time or another and I have never had any phone break from any fall or impact untill now. In short, a fragile, frustrating phone to use for basic daily functions with a fairly hefty price tag."	0
"I got this item because it was supposed to have an unlockable bootloader.  Not true.  Even though it was the H815 model, LG said it was the wrong variant so I was forced to use the bloated stock rom.  So I gave it to my kid to use.  It then died within a couple of weeks.  Motherboard issue.  Unfixable according to the local repair shop.  A total waste of time and money.  I will never buy an LG phone again."	0
i got this phone and it was activated under another account so i can&apos;t use the phone. i have been trying to get a hold of this girl and finally did she said she would look into things and call me back she still hasnt. i have tried calling her and she doesn&apos;t return my calls or emails. TERRIBLE EXPIERENCE! don&apos;t recomned buying from this seller at all!	0
"I got this phone because of the memory and the camera. The camera is awesome and it truly does have tons of memory. That's about it. The video sound is TERRIBLE. I have hated this phone since the day I got it, but the memory was hard to beat for the price and I needed alot of memory. If you need a phone for video, get something else because you will not be happy with this. And, the battery life sucks if you're actually going to use this phone. It won't hold a charge and you can't change the battery so don't buy an extra. Oh, and the Gorilla Glass is questionable. My fiancee also has one of these and he's had 4 phones because the glass does break"	0
"i got this phone for my niece for her b-day,and she loved it the first week she had it,but after that the phone started acting up.she now cant bluetooth,or use her multi-media,this has broken her heart,and mine to.LG is a great brand when it comes to home entertainment,but when it comes to mobile phones they aren&apos;t.i think i&apos;m just going to just stick with their tv&apos;s for now."	0
"I got this phone In june of 2009. I really loved it and babied it, If i could have protected everything on it with a cover I would. I had a full body screen protector on it and never dropped it a lot of times, I only remember like 2 times. It was running low on battery one day and then just shut off and i tried to get it to power back on, but the  music buttons were all that lit up. I COULDNT get the keys over to the number-style and i couldnt get it on. The battery worked, it was tested in another friends E8 and then his battery but into my phone, and my phone still didnt turn on. Don&apos;t know about what happened to the phone, but did anybody else have this problem?"	0
"I got this phone to replace the Moto X that I had before this one. It was the exact same model. I got my original Moto X from the AT&T Store and it lasted me about a year and a half before it quit working. I liked the Moto X, so I decided to get another one. I got this one in October and it started off working fine. I didn't have any problems with it until late December. It randomly stopped charging with my Motorola charger. I used my sister's Samsung fast charger because that was the only charger that would work. I tried others, but nothing. My phone also started losing battery unusually fast. Now, the Samsung charger won't keep it charged. I don't think it was worth over $100 for a phone that only lasted 2 months. "	0
"I got this product thinking i could unlock and i was not able to,so i trashed it,i wont make this mistake again ,i do admit it was my fault for thinking the way i did"	0
"I got what I paid for and more, the phone was in perfect condition. Neatly packaged with screen protector and additional case, headphones and charger. Best purchase I have made on E-bay."	1
"I guess this product was too old, Sprint couldn&apos;t even activate it. Better to indicate year of the product so that at least I could of check with Sprint that if they can still activate it."	0
"I had a galaxy S3 whose charger port wore out...but very happy to get the same model again, as it does everything i need it to do, plus more.  The seller delivered superfast!"	1
"I had a One M9 and ""upgraded"" to a 10. HUGE mistake. The One M9 has SO much better sound. The 9 has matching speakers at the top and bottom of the screen that face FORWARD. When you turn the phone sideways to watch videos, you get true stereo and much better bass response. The stereo effect is quite noticeable. The 9 sounds simply amazing for a phone. The 10 is as average sounding as any ordinary phone. The 9 also has an IR port. The 10 loses the great sound and the IR Port. I used the IR port constantly as I use the phone as a universal remote for the entertainment center and every tv in the house. I gave the 10 to my son and ordered a good used 9 off of ebay. Much happier with the 9!"	1
I had a Samsung galaxy s5  This note 4 I like  this one much better.	1
"I had already purchased one of these, and it was ran over by a car. So I did not hesitate to buy another, and this was priced reasonable. It works well, and I am happy with it."	1
"I had an LG G2 that I loved, but it has started to malfunction and the battery life is shorter than it used to be.  I decided to go with the G4 after my son got one and is happy with it.  The operation is very similar to what I am used to, so no learning curve.  The battery life is great and it is replaceable in this one, which is an improvement over the G2.  The phone I received appears to be new and worked instantly when I moved my sim card from the old phone to this one.  Since this is not the latest iteration of the flagship LG phone, I got it much reduced in price than a latest and greatest phone would have been.  I is plenty fast and does everything I need it to do.  I am, so far, totally satisfied with this purchase."	1
I had bought the phone as a cheap back up phone.  It was the first refurburished phone I had purchased.  It seemed to be a good solid simple phone at first but after using the Motorola e815 for a couple of weeks I was in the middle of a call and the signal disappeared.  At first I thought something had happened to the signal itself but I checked on other cell phones and they had full signal.  Since then the signal will be strong and then goes to no bars.  This is happening so often that I stopped using this phone.	0
"I had galaxies 1-5 and when they released version 6 where they took away the removable battery, water proofing and external SD card support I said no more Samsung and went to LG (for G4, G5 and G6). When I failed to get my hands on  LG G7 after more than a month of trying I researched the S9+ and figured I'd give Samsung a try again. Had it for less than a week but very pleased with it so fair and excited by all the positive changes to the Samsung UI (touchwiz)."	1
"I had my choice narrowed down to 4 phones all were basically the same price and I had eliminated every phone that was not listed as &quot;NEW&quot;.  I choose buying this phone from Tejara Group because they had the most extras for the same price.  When I received the phone it had someone elses wallpaper, several hundred phone numbers and it was quite obvious this phone was not &quot;NEW&quot; like it&apos;s description had stated.  When I emailed them back they stated that it clearly stated the phone was &quot;Like New&quot;.  To which I replied with a copy / pasted screen clearly showing that the phone stated and still states that the phone is &quot;NEW&quot;.  I decided that I would at least try the phone.  I used it for a few weeks only to discover a few more problems.  The back cover (battery cover) would routinely fall off, the bluetooth feature did not work very well and the Wallet was locked and I had no way of getting the passcode to get into it.  All in all I said this is enough and contacted the merchant to return the phone.  I returned it over a week ago and I still have not received my credit.    So if the question was if I would ever buy from this merchant again the answer would clearly be no, not even if he was selling everything at half price."	0
"I had one and just loved it because it is simply a phone. I am not in to the new style of phone like iPhones and such I get great reception on this, and it has taken a beating. I actually got this as a back up for when the current one dies. the flip phone is getting hard to find. I&apos;m an old school type I guess."	1
I had one of these phones.I broke it bought this one.Ilove the phone. It is like night and day next to my older phone.I like the way it slides and gives you a key board so that you can text alot easier and faster.	1
"I had problems with this phone mostly due to software issues and updates that either have not or could not have been considered, When I Contacted the seller they did respond immediatly and tried to help so I have no issues with them I believe they acted n good faith all the way. The phone just turns out to be not a good idea"	1
I had the EnV3 for over 2 years and it was a great phone but the battery life started to go down so I decided to upgrade to the EnV Touch and I am so glad that I did. This is a super nice phone with all the qualities of a smart phone with out the extra payment that comes with a smart phone. If you&apos;ve never had a touch screen phone it does take some getting used to but it is not hard to work. For those that have bigger fingers you could use a pencil eraser or a stylus that goes with one of the Nintendo DS devices if it helps!	1
"I had the same phone for 4 years and loved it&apos;s size and features.the incoming sound started to be poor, so, I went to ebay and found a factory referbished. scooped it up immeditly."	1
"I had this phone before, but in blue. I lost it a week later and it was not insured. I went on ebay to find the phone again and was very happy when I found it and it was half the price I paid for the other one. I watched very closely to see if I was going to get the bid. When to last minutes came down and I beat all the other bids, I was so happy. I am not good at bidding cause if it doesn&apos;t look like I could win I give up. This time I really wanted that phone, so I hung in there. I was really impressed by the short time it took for it to reach my home,also. I glad I remember to check on ebay. It was worth it to me. I also insured it this time, so I don&apos;t run into the same problem again. I will be a returning customer."	1
I had this phone when it first came out and loved it. This one was great until I tried to use the camera and it froze the phone and I had to remove the battery to get it to restart. Now when I try and use the camera or look at the one photo I got it says unauthorized and freezes the phone until I remove the battery. 	0
I had to buy a new phone because I am careless with mine and water! I do not like the LG as much as my past phone that I washed but I was looking for a phone with a keyboard for texting. This phone was easy to transfer over to.	1
I had to resell my blu dash less than a month I purchaded because  the picture quality is bad. I actually didn&apos;t like it at all.	0
I had to send the seller the phone back brcause it was shutting off every forty minutes after a week of use	0

The return subject is poor and can not help customs ! just only one chance to open the case, if we close it, we will not have chance anymore, why? and many people told me they had bad experience in ebay too!!! they bought something was not worth the money they paid too!!!   for me, I think it was a sooooooooo bad experience! and it let me down! I don&apos;t want to buy something from ebay anymore!!!"	0
I hate this phone!!!!	0

"I have a friend who bought a phone like this new. She loved it at first, but it has had some problems since she used it awhile. I don&apos;t think they hold up that good.     Mine was broken, beat up and I returned it.. hopefully someday I&apos;ll get a refund. HAAA haaa haa haa! I agree the feed back system is bullshit. If you buy and pay immediately they will still not rate you accordingly if you tell anyone your real story. Won&apos;t buy electronics on Ebay again..... EVER. There are too many real merchants who are happy to take my money. Don&apos;t this crap!!"	0
I have a three-year-old Motorola V9 . It&apos;s been a good phone . But I dropped it and now has a crack in it . So I bought one off eBay . When I got it was not exactly like the one I have . It didn&apos;t have the power . And the battery life is short . The good thing is I contacted the person I bought it from . And they refunded my money . All I was out of was little time . I don&apos;t know what to buy now . All I&apos;m looking for is a good cell phone decent battery life. Not everybody can afford smart phones . The contract cost is prohibitive .	0
I have always had a blade phone before. But it was broke. So this was a very good deal .I have always been impressed with. The blade and the pro. I really do not know what the question was asking. When it said before it have a  small form?. Factor.  Please tell me. Why that is	1
"I have always loved when I had my first razr, but when I go older I wanted the new and coolest thing but I absolutely hate touch screens so I decided to buy a razr again and I am very satisfied"	1
"I have been a fond user of Windows PDA devices.  They were the first interfaces introduced in the phone market, not apples iphone.  The software is very dependable and useful to any microsoft business products,  including Office.  I now have 3 of these units purchased over the past 2 months.  I did not upgrade to 4g because AT&amp;amp;T did not have any 4G phones available with a qwerty.  It is a blessing it was not available.  I spent less than $500 for all 3 excellent condition phones.  I would have spent more if I bought new 4G phones with a 2 year service plan. My theory on these phones.  If your business uses windows,  this is the best phone of choice.  Buy used equipment and not new. You will save a bundle and get 90% of the stuff the new phones have. Buy,based on your needs, not your wants. When I buy used,I  don&amp;apos;t need to purchase a data plan and that saves me more money. If I want to access the internet from the phone and you have a plan for at home use, wi-fi will connect to it."	1
"I have been looking for a while for this product, and this seller had the best price and his reviews were good. i would buy more from this seller"	1
I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET MY 4 SONS A DEAL LIKE THIS FOR AWHILE THEY WORK IN HEAVY EQUIPMENT CONSTRUCTION AND HE LOVES IT WILL FOLLOW YOU TO SEE IF YOU HAVE MORE THANKS AND HAVE A BLESSED DAY!	1
I have been using the Motorola Razar and all the others as the have been up graded and this is the best one yet.	1
I have bought and sold on E Bay through the years. I received this phone it would not work. I sent it back the same day that I received it. I paid the postage as the man told me to do. I finally reported it to Pay Pal giving them the tracking number. It is still not settled.  	0
I have bought this product because saw his technical parameters. I was very interested . When i saw it real do not disappoint. I very like this phone!	1
"I have found lately that so many sellers over state the items they are selling... and often actually lie.  Quite the opposite here.  The seller says ""new""... AND IT IS NEW.  Came in the original box with all accessories and manuals.  The box was factory sealed.  Put in the SIM card and SD and POOF... up and going.  Thank you for being an honest seller."	1
"I have had 2 of these phones and they have both cracked in the same places. Both of the phones I had have lasted me about 6 months each. They are too top heavy!!! Another thing...the battery cover always falls off and the attenna gets loose. I have several friends with the same phone and they have or had the same problems with it.  I love Nokia phones, but I would not recommend this phone to anyone."	0
"I have had an iPhone 5 prior to this one and I loved it......I had it for more than three years , dropped in water at 1 1/2 years and still running i jus upgraded to the iPhone 6s.......so when my daughter needed a phone I did not hesitate to get her iPhone 5........so far she is please with it as well......well built phone "	1
"I have had my Razor now for about a year and I just love it, and my Razor is my 6Th cell phone and it is by far my favorite. I love it&apos;s slim sleek style I can stick it right in front pocket of my jeans, and just forget it until it rings or vibrates, and it is a light weight phone. It also has a great camera that can take some really great crisp pictures. Also takes some nice short video&apos;s. Keeps a Great Signal, &amp; long battery life. One of my favorite is being able to put picture I.D for people calling you that is just awesome that way you see a picture of the person who is calling just so cool then you can also give everyone there own ring tone. I saw where someone left a review saying these phones break easy well I have had mine now for about a year, and I have drop it a few times and on hard surface and it doesn&apos;t have a crack on it &amp; no malfunctions of any kind it still works like it did when I bought it new. My whole family loves the Razor so much that they want me to up grade their phones on their B-Days to Razors. I know I love it so much that I am going to upgrade soon to the one with the MP3 player on it. I do say this is a phone I am glad I got and my money was well well spent on. I give it a rating of 5 out of 5."	1
"I have had several types of Motorola phones through the years &amp; with various carriers. I have also had other brands, but when my phone was dying of old age I decided I wanted to go back to Motorola. I went to ebay for 2 reasons, did not want to be under a new contract &amp; because AT&amp;T does not carry the Motorola RAZR I like. I am not into the so called smartphones. Won&apos;t use all the features &amp; don&apos;t want to pay for them! The RAZR V3xx is a nice easy to use but reliable phone. Has good clear sound, can&apos;t complain about the picutes I&apos;ve taken. I made sure my phone was a new one &amp; from the US. I have no complaints and have had the phone several months. I would buy again and deffiantly recommend to anyone."	1
I have had this phone 6 weeks and it has not received or sent picture msgs since week 1. I have been on the phone with tech support and escalated tech support for HOURS since there are no Cricket stores in my city. They got it working and then it stopped working again 2 days later. I would NOT buy this phone again. Maybe other models are better with this carrier but this one stinks in Ohio.	0
"I have had this phone for almost a year now and I still love it just as much as when I first purchased it.   I was put off by the shape and size of the first lg lotus... but because it&apos;s nearly the only flip-phone that sprint still offers, I decided to give it a try.  I must say, I am very impressed, not only with the design but with the high functionality of the phone.  The shape ended up working to it&apos;s benefit, with a fairly large screen and the wonderful blackberry-esque keyboard.   However, I do find the updated touch screen feature on the front relatively pointless... and I recomend getting a scratch resistant cover for the screen because it scratches very easily, but that&apos;s to be expected.  Over all, I think that this is a great phone for anyone. When it comes to replacing it, I believe I will get another, if necessary."	1
I have had two phones returned and Straight talk will not exchange it for a different make refurbish phones are a total rip off.	0
"I have never had a Motorola phone before, I&apos;m very disapointed. The biggest problem is that I can hardly hear who I am talking to with the volume all the way up. I have NEVER had this problem with my older phones. I have had one Nokia and one Samsung. I prefer either one over this, even without all of the features.   The software is very slow. It often freezes up when I hit the camara button.  I have to remove the battery and put it back in to un-freeze it.   My husband tells me he calls 6 times somedays before I answer... it only rings once."	0
I have never used a smart phone and appreciate the simplicity of basic phones.  Good: 1. Nice feel in the hand 2. Right size 3. Buttons look and feel good  Not so good: 1. After using the phone for 6 days (possibly a dozen of calls) the hinge broke. 2. The user interface is not appealing 3. There is no provision to create tasks or let's say I could not figure out 4. Battery lasted 3 days - I would expect at least 5 with me almost just carrying it  Conclusion: BLU - never again	0
I have not as of today May 10th 2011 received my package that was sent out May 2nd 2011....was needed by this week..	0
"I have not had a chance to use the phone as the sim card did not work - although it was supposed to be a new phone. Also, when I put in a search I expressly said ""Unlocked"". As a result I ordered this phone not understanding that the ""brand"" meant that the phone was locked. So now I am in a contract for a year with a company that I never heard of and as I write this the phone is still not working. A new sim card was sent out and the big guys somewhere in tech world are working on it. And of course there was no return to this seller. JUST read the small print. Even though you may request certain parameters - I guess if part of the request matches - that's good enough for ebay."	0

"I have not received the phone. The seller couldn&apos;t provide any tracking no. than he put a tracking number on a PayPal dispute, when I have reported the situation. The tracking no. didn&apos;t exist of course because the only message which appears on DHL site says &apos;The no. of the parcel is wrong or it doesn&apos;t exist&apos;. I have no money and no phone now."	0
I have not recieved the item on the time that was given.	0
I have not yet recieved it and i would like to let everyone know don&apos;t buy things from shitty people that try to stiff you and i would like a refund and he did not put insurance on the phone so i can&apos;t get my money back.	0
I have nothing positive to say about this phone. I&apos;m not even sure why it&apos;s considered a &quot;smart phone&quot;. It won&apos;t run half the apps I want it to. Piece of crap. I wouldn&apos;t pay $10 for a new one.	0
I have ordered multiple of these devices and they either arrive DOA or they will not power on. They are simply end of life for a reason.	0
"I have owned my Samsung Galaxy SII since 2013. It was my first smart phone. The battery life is not that great, but overall it is still a good phone. I am having to look for a new phone now because the portal for the charging chord is not working. I tried purchasing a new battery, but that did not work either. The charging portal was actually draining the battery. I guess I can't really complain since I have owned the phone for 4 years, although I had a flip phone,before this one, for 12 years. "	1
I have problem to active 	0
"I have purchased three S4 phones from this company and they stand behind their products.  One of the phones had a slight overheating problem and the company paid to have it shipped back to them and promptly refunded my purchase price.  The other two phones were great.  These phones are brand new in the original box and are shipped quickly.  All information on Ebay is exactly correct, their communication is great and they are easy to deal with.  Can't say enough about the positive experience dealing with them. And by the way I bought a replacement phone for the one.  I would certainly go back to this seller again and again."	1
"I have recieved my krzr1 phone and was very satisfied with the entire purchase of the sale. everything went as planned. i am very pleased with my choice, thank you!                                     BREEZZIE7"	1
"I have seen pictures and videos of this phone in water for up to 30 minutes.  I have used this phone for a while now, and I only just today was able to test its water resistant capabilities.  Which are none.  This stupid thing TOUCHED the water, and it now will not turn on.  I have (and did so immediately) removed the battery and will wait until the end of tomorrow, 35+ hours, before I test it.  I can not believe this is happening.  I am thoroughly upset.  I am most upset with the seller for selling me a faulty product advertised as new..........."	0

"i have the same phone, it needsa alot more momory, my phone is always freezing up and SLOW windows 6.0 gotta go! epic fail HTC"	0
"I have this phone so I was getting one for my gf and after a full test including battery I can say this was a solid purchase. There were a few casing dents, but I use a case anyways. Otherwise solid."	1
I have to say that this is a bad cellphone with a bad very bad battery life. It take almost 12 hours to charge it. Also it has problems with normal applications like Waze and Spotify.  I think that is not even a good cellphone for your gramma or your favorite aunt.  Unfortunatelly it was a bad purchase  	0
I have used ebay to order two phones one for myself and one for my father. The phones that I purchased were in excellent condition there was a phone charger for the house and also for the car.I really appreciate how fast I received my merchandise. Because of the great experience I had shopping on ebay I will continue to make future purchases. Thank you	1
"I have used this phone for a few years, had to replace a gray version of the same phone. I drop it in acetone, but it still work for about 6 mos. after that. I like it being a flip phone, I feel like the ear and mouth areas are in the right place."	1
"I haven&apos;t received it. Have no idea if it would please me. Bought it in a auction, but I will not do it again."	0
"I havent receive this item, please refund my money!  I havent receive this item, please refund my money!  I havent receive this item, please refund my money!"	0
I heard it was a good phone but it turned out to be much better. Was worth the $. Sorry I didn't upgrade sooner.	1
I hope this lady not dishonest. I see she refused to pay for an item she won and lied about why canceled her bid.	0
"I initially really thought I&apos;d like this phone. It worked and was good. That was what I needed, a functioning phone, that sent and recieved calls and texts. It worked for about 3 months (first phone) and then the screen turned either upside down, or had lines in it. Verizon replaced it free of charge, and I was given the exact same phone. it worked for 5 months, and then the screen just plain stayed off, no matter what any one did, black screen. Was replaced again. This phone would run out of battery even though on my friends 4500, it worked excellently. It was replaced again. I got the new phone, and it wouldn&apos;t even turn on when I recieved it. The first phone was the best, but it will get tiresome when it stops working for the 4th time!"	0
"I just bought it but compared to LG Optimus GT540 it&apos;s virtually the same except that it&apos;s thinner, lighter , smaller and comes with Android 2.2 Froyo. I think the speaker could have been louder but it&apos;s not too low. Touch screen is very sensitive, almost no need touching, but if you put a protective screen on it you will need to press normally. Response to actions is quite fast considering 600MHz processor. Screen is a good size too. Haven&apos;t watched movies on it yet but messaging is comfortable. If not there&apos;s the voice recognition option or Droid control connection using pc keyboard ! Only thing that bothers me is that you have to press a small button to unlock it and sometimes it&apos;s not that easy to locate. Haven&apos;t got the hang of it yet. Quite annoying. Loads of apps, for whatever you may need. Reception is good . Over all a great mobile."	1
i just dont like it !!!	0
"I just got this phone not even a week ago. I get dropped calls every few seconds. It takes 30 minutes to send a photo, sometimes even a text. The screen keeps freezing. I'll answer a call and it freezes. It just runs so slow. I have checked the network, and everything is normal. It's just a horrible phone experience. People on the other line say they can't hear me because it sounds muffled. Will return.  "	0
I just love the phone. It's the right size and the extra storage space of a 64 gb is a winner. It does so many things and I'm learning how to use all the features. 	1
I just plugged it in to charge it for the first time since I got it and nothing won't charge. I have tried three others cords and nothing. I feel ripped off. So now I take it in to get fixed and the cost goes up. 	0
"I just received this phone today, and try to charge the battery before i turn it on and use. after i turn the phone on it say restrict and i need a code to remove the code. and the phone is poor condition. on the right upper side of the phone is damage."	0
i just to talk to the seller about the product i wanted a refund and seller act like i did not know how to do my phone i will not buy from this seller again	0
"I just wanted to take a moment to say what a fantastic buying experience this was for me.  I was very timid about purchasing a &quot;cell&quot; phone off ebay, but this seller made it so easy.  Not too mention when I sent a message about 4 days after receiving the phone that the battery that came with the phone was only holding a charge for about a day - without reservation, they sent me two more just in case.  This to me says a lot about the integrity of the seller.  So thank you and may you be an example to other sellers on ebay!  Recommended and will buy from again!!"	1
I know I only pay a $1.29 but they should&apos;nt be selling this kind of stuff the sanyo scp 2400 that I bought from this ebay member was good for garbage an thats exactly were it is at.	0
"I left just after ordering the phone and returned to find that I was sent one with a bad battery.  The battery wa replaced, however it took me a while to figure out that the phone only rang when it felt like it.    I guess they must think that that is something you should be able to figure out in a couple of minutes.  I must be the only person in the world that gets missed calls.  I wonder why they put that function on cell phones them.      That I was uable to figure out immediatly that I waws given aphone that only rang when it felt like it they told me that I was outof luck becasue I had exceded the warranteeperiod.    DO NOT BUY A CELL PHONE FROM THIS SITE!    THERE ARE PLENTY OF OTHER SITES THAT ACTUALLY STAND BEHIND THE PRODUCTS THE SELL, SO WHY TAKE A CHANCE.    DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND USE A DIFFERENT VENDOE TO BUY A CELL PHONE OR ANYTHING ELSE FROM."	0
"I like because is Fast, Good Android Operating System, Excellent Touch Screen and have many features. I recommend this phone to any person that have a good data plan."	1

"I like Nokia very much, especially this product.  It was a great product. Simple to use and very pratical. Usually the brand Nokia has few problems compare to other brands"	1
I like that it works...i hate that it doesn&apos;t hold a charge and that this flaw was not disclosed! buyers have the right to know everything about a product that they are interested in.	0
I like the applications that are available for the Treo. It sure makes it nice not having to get on a computer to do a lot of things I can do on the phone. The ability to sync via bluetooth is great since I&apos;m using a 64-bit Windows 7. The clarity of the calls is great and the options for the phone is great!	1
I like the cell phone in general. I decided to buy it because is a great touch phone and is vry nice.	1
"I like the edge to edge screen and the picture quality is very nice! The device has a nice feel to it, solid feeling and svelt. I like it, but I also liked the 1984 movie Dune."	1
"I like the fast shipping and the way the phone looks.  The seller got back to me when my daughter was unable to set up the answering system because it was locked.  She gave us her code to open it. Unfortunately the MP3 player doesnt work.  According to the seller it was never used as an MP3 player so she didnt know it didnt work.  I, on the other hand, was buying it because of the MP3 player. It was the same phone that was stolen from my daughter so I wanted to replace it.  Now when she takes the bus she needs to take a phone and her other MP3 player because the one on the phone doesnt work.  I just wish that everything worked.  Camera is fine, cosmetics of the phone is good....but no MP3.  Disappointing"	0

"I like the phone, don&apos;t have to worry about dropping and braking it.  wish the sound was louder, have it set on outside. that is a little louder. but would buy it again, and have recomended it to my brother."	1
I like the price on Ebay make me easy to compair the phone and the price and if I donn&apos;t want it I can return or refun it.	1
I like the quality and service. I had had one before that was stolen liked it so much decided to replace.  Good price.	1
"I like the size and clamshell design of this phone.  The music player is great and doesn&apos;t need ear phones, because of the decent speaker.  Reception is better than the Nokia that it replaced and it has never froze or quit like some say it does.  I think some people are not patient and won&apos;t wait for things to take their time so they keep pushing buttons which over whelms the machines -- same thing happens with computers -- push the button once and give it some time,"	1
"I like the style and more but the only thing I don&apos;t like is the battery doesn&apos;t last long,i bought this cell because was betty chip and I like it"	1
i like the way the keypad flips over i bought it coz its a small stylisi like the way the keypad flips over i bought it coz its a small stylish phoneh phone	1
i like this item because its unlocked and can be used with any cell provider that uses a sim card. i needed to buy it because my phone stopped working and i dont get an upgrade til next year.	1
"I like this phone because I like what I saw, how fast  on apps, I wanted it, Now that I got it I love this phone, I recommend it, its light weight small enough to excersice,i had iphone prior to this, this is way better, now my husband wants one! Ive had so many phones in the past 6 months. Wasnt happy. I found my match! I forgot to mention,its water resistant and glass its tough it wont get scratched easily,no more ugly protectors!"	1
"I like this phone better than any phone I've had in a while.  For some reason it's easier to operate than the S5 it replaces.  The 16gb/2gb is definitely worth the money.  Battery is the best I've had in a phone - moderate/heavy use and it goes all day.  Only drawback is the slow charge.  Otherwise, awesome phone"	1
"I like this phone, nice size, not to big. Lots of memory internal and also SD card."	1
"I like to be able to use the touch screen, styling and functionality  very easy browser surfing and emailing is breeze. I recommend the torch  9800, because the best of the B&gt;B"	1
I liked and I would recommend  the item is equal to what you see in the auction all the information the seller gives the right works fine.	1
I liked it because i saw a very good price and excellent condition and very good deals to the customer who buys.  a very Excellency	1
I liked that I got a good deal on the item. The listing did not have a picture so I feel that most people are scepticale on the items condition. Although the item was in great shape which would have been well illusrtated by a picture. The product was true to the description. I think that it would have made him more money if he had a pic.	0

"I liked this phone as it was for a  minor to use for school purposes, it fit the requirements perfectly.   I was pleased to have purchased it as it was great value for money, this is why I decided to but it and also it fulfilled everything that was required from it.  The phone is easy for anyone to use and the advert was precise, the phone is just like new, it looks like it has never been used before.  The box it came in is brand new and all the instrutions are in the box also.  There is nothing I could say I did not like about this phone because I like everything about it."	1
I live in Oklahoma and ordered this phone only to be told when I activated it that I can't have a Oklahoma number. The phone can only be activated with a Florida number. So I can't carry my old number to this phone. Totally mad about this. 	0

"I love many things about this phone, but it does not charge consistently. When I plug it in, it tells me to use the charger that it came with (a usb c?) because it is charging too slowly (REALLY SLOWLY!). I am using the charger that came with it. Help! "	0
I love my iPhone 5 - 64gb. I had no problem going to AT&amp;T getting every thing switched over. I would buy this product again.	1
I love my new Galaxy s8 Active! It arrived right on time and works great!	1

"i love that the ebay seller was so descriptive and honest about the phone. i really enjoy the touch and qwerty keyboard. it is a simple, easy phone that receives emails and closes so i don&apos;t have to worry about locking my keypad. it is really easy to load stuff onto my micro sd like music and ringtones. i&apos;m really happy with it and the camera is set up to take your picture! what girl wouldn&apos;t love that!"	1

I love the features though	0
I LOVE the iphone. Bought it for a friend. It was a great price for the iphone 4. I have a white one and knew she would like a black one. It was a totally good choice. You can&apos;t go wrong with an iphone!!	1
"I love The Mate 10 pro. Great looking phone, high end specs, excellent build quality and Superior camera. I also own the Note 8 and I can say that this camera on the mate 10 pro takes better pictures than the Note 8. No Joke. The quality of the pictures that this phone takes will blow you away. Why the US want to keep Huawei out of retail stores is crazy. I think they know that it will kill the other major Android manufactures or force them to go down on their prices.  "	1
"I love the P30 Pro, it is an awesome phone and it shipped fast... The camera is spectacular! "	1
I love the phone because it&apos;s so easy to use and the seller was very professional. and the phone is simple but very technically secure	1

I love this phone because it is just that--a phone.  The industrial design is really nice too.  It works internationally and it&apos;s small and compact.  It fits well in my pocket but doesn&apos;t like the warmth in a confined space.  I&apos;m on my 3rd T28 and can&apos;t seem to make the jump to the newer generation phones.	1
I LOVE THIS PHONE IS GREAT. I HAVE BOUGHT SEVERAL DEVICES AND THIS ONE IS THE BEST. I USE TO HAVE THE IPHONE 5S BUT THE GALAXY S4 IS THE BEST. I HAVE THE GALAXY S5 TOO BUT THERE IS NOT MUCH DIFFERENCE I PREFER THE GALAXY S4	1
"I love this phone it&apos;s so much faster things I don&apos;t like: the battery kind of loses charge and the music sounds flat on it no EQ which should be included and better battery should come with the phone other than that it&apos;s a great phone and blows the iphone away the iphone is putting things on the iOS4 that was already on android for the most part (multitasking, folders woopdie doo lol) other than a higher resolution so what and a front facing camera which is already on android phone b4 Apple needs to step up to the plate now they revolutionized the cell phone market in 07 with the iphone, but that&apos;s it so far?"	1
I love this phone so much. It works amazingly and is worth every penny! It was a really cheap iPhone and I definitely recommend it to anyone! 	1
"I love this phone! I already have an internet tablet (Android) so it was a cinch to set up and navigate. It&apos;s the best of both worlds having a touchscreen and qwerty to work with. I use it as an mp3 player and store all my photos in it as well, plus it has a 3.2 megapixel camera/video camera, making it a useful multimedia device. I expanded my storage with an 8GB micro SD card. There are a slew of apps you can download from the installed market. I installed the Borders app so all the books in my Borders library are accessible to read on the phone. I installed Pandora to listen to my existing stations I have on my PC. So much more you can do with it! I would recommend the Intercept to anyone interested in a techy but not overwhelming phone. As a phone itself it has good sound quality and reception. The threaded text messaging is great. I have wireless backup but I couldn&apos;t use it with this phone. I had to punch in all my contacts myself or take it to a Sprint store where they could transfer it (free of charge). That was somewhat inconvenient but the phone as a whole is awesome."	1
I love this phone! It was a bit too expensive when it first came out but now its at a Great Price!! Camera is awesome and the so called problem people found with the buttons..I actually find to be a nice change. Charges fast and holds a charge pretty good so far. And with 128 Gigs..you cant go wrong.	1
"I LOVE this phone!!!  I only wish the batery life was a little better..  It generally gets me through the day, but ocasionally runs out of juice before the end of the day under heavier use.  I&apos;m also just a little dissapointed that it has no MSD card slot, although the internal memory has been more than suficient so far."	1
"I love this phone, gorgeous screen, Google navigation, google maps, text to speech, front facing camera, high res back camera, video chat, kickstand, records at 720p for high def video, just pure awesomeness!!!"	1
"I love this phone, wish I could use it more. LOL I received the item quickly and the seller was great. "	1
I love this phone.  It has the same feature as a more expensive phone I wanted.  I am happy with the purchase of the Motorola I856 Boost MObile phone.  I would reccomend this phone to others.	1
I love this phone. Battery could be better. But all and all. Great buy	1
"I love this phone. I had to get use to it as I use to use a slide out phone for texting and this is all in one. The keys are small, close together and sometimes I hit a wrong key but nothing to want to send it back or give a bad review for. Great phone! great price!"	1
I love this phone. It really is attached to my hip everyday. This is the third phone same brand I bought its perfect for everything I need. thank you	1
I love this Phone. The price was excellent. I received the phone when I was suppose too. Great. I will buy from this seller again.	1
"I love this phone...so easy to use. The only thing that does get a little annoying is the lag that it has when you click on an app, widget. But other than that it&apos;s a great phone! the internet on this phone is amazing as well as all it&apos;s applications and apps. The camera although it&apos;s a 2 mgp takes really great pics and has many cool options to make your pics looks cool. I LOVE IT! I highly recommend."	1
"I love to be able to use the touch screen, but then for my detailed emails i just slide the phone up and i have a full keyboard. Its everything you loved about blackberry and more. New operating system, Blackberry 6 is simple to use and quite easy once to play around with it. Very easy browser surfing and emailing is a breeze! Well worth whatever dollar value you paid, just remember to check with your local cell phone company as this phone only sells for 609.99 at most cell provider stores, so paying over this is just stupid!     Enjoy!"	1
I love/hate that it's a big phone. It can be hard to hold onto but the screen size and battery life are worth it! 	1
"I loved it. It was shipped supper fast, the seller was excellent. I bought that item because I wanted to change my phone and the price was very good."	1
I loved the LG EnV 3 and when that ended I got the EnV touch. The EnV touch is a great phone and runs even faster then the old one. Its bigger so typing on the keyboard is a breeze. I love this phone.	1
"I loved the phone; howevr, the internal antenae is messed up; which means I can not use it. When I contacted seller, they treated me very badly, said I was crazy, i am a scam, they aslo said I was someone else who left bad feedback. when I recontacted them they blew me off and used more negative words. They basically told me to bad."	0
I loved this phone and it ALWAYSSSSSSSSSSSS worked until I dropped it and it mysteriously stopped powering up It didnt look damaged just wouldnt power up.	1
I lvoe the LG Dare.  It is very easy to use and I especially like that I can lock it so I don&apos;t make calls accidentally.	1
I managed to fixed it and turn out the phone still working not a 100% but still ok and reliable. overall I like it.	1
"I mostly bought it because my old smartphone became really old, and I&apos;m pretty happy. It&apos;s very slim, nice, powerful and helpful.     Sometimes it slows down like a computer and you need to reboot, and indeed the battery life is just one day when you&apos;re online all the time, but these two things are quite reasonable, I believe.    Overall, it&apos;s a great device that I can recommend to my friends."	1
I need help! Can I use this phone abroad or out of US?	0
i need to return the phone but i dont know how the problem with the phone has low hearing when calling someone.	0
I needed a cell phone I could take to the beach so it had to be waterproof. I think I purchased the correct phone	1
"I needed a new cell phone and wanted the same phone as the one I had. My carrier told me it would take a while to get one because they were back ordered and I found just what I wanted here and got a super great price.  It was advertised as like new and that is exactly what I got.    It only had a very, very small amount of wear and no marks on the screen. Best of all is that now that my contract has expired with my carrier I have a like new phone and no contract.    Bottom line is I got just what I was shopping for and a great price to boot. Thank you Ebay (and my seller)    Leo Dean  Brunswick, Georgia USA"	1
"I needed a new phone because my other one broke.  I mistakenly made the choice to buy from Andy from China.  I thought everything was great.  After I won my KA09 phone, it was said to be delivered in 8-18 business days.  Even though that was awhile, I was still &quot;happy&quot; with my purchase.  I even emailed him and got a prompt response answering my questions.  When the package came business days later, I opened it to find head phone.  Not my phone, my charger, my car charger and battery.. headphones- that didn&apos;t even belong to my phone.  I emailed Andy and received a response saying how sorry he was and how he didn&apos;t understood how it happened.  Being from China, they clearly use English translation to write to American English speaking customers, because I barely understood what the email said.  The email said this: &quot;See you in the mail, we are very sorry! We have a special place the project staff. You say you received is headphones. I do not know how it happened, I will investigate the matter. We will pay the duty, please do not worry. Or I&apos;ll immediately send you a phone for you. Please trust us. Thank you!&quot;  After much deliberation, I decided I could not wait another 11 business days for another phone, so I kindly asked him for my money back, and what he wanted me to do with the headphones.  He said he would refund me the money and to &quot;note the check&quot;.  Waiting and waiting for 2 weeks, I finally opened a case with paypal and ebay demanding my money back.  I would never buy from this seller because I had to go through so much hassle to get a phone, then so much time and then it was wrong anyway.  Then instead of fixing the mistake, I had to wait over a month to receive my money back, and it wasn&apos;t even from him! Paypal and ebay had to pay me back! Do yourself a favor everyone, NEVER BUY FROM HIM! You will certainly save yourself a lot of time, money, and frustration.  Buy from JustCellular in California! Wonderful place and great phones!!"	0
i needed a phone and it was cheap but cheap can be nasty and nasty it was. It was a dirty phone it dosent take very good pictures and the cover dosent fit well	0
I needed a replacement for my work phone that wasn&amp;apos;t big and bulky. This flip phone was perfect. It is small and functional with no defects. And the price was a steal.	1
"I needed a working phone so, I purcased the i670 .Seller described Item as a good working phone but when I received it it&apos;s batterie was shot&quot;would not hold charge&quot; and the phone would over heat.I would not recommend to anyone!! Buyer Beware !!!"	0
I needed the LCD and ended up (temporarily) needing the digitizer and they both worked out great	1
"I needed to replace my flip phone, the screen stopped working. I did not want to get stuck into a new 2 year contract getting it from my service provider. I loved that it was a flip phone, an LG and no 2 year contract. I liked that it came with the battery &amp; charger, in fact 2 batteries were sent.It was in better condition than I expected it to be in. The description said good but I consider it excellent.Love it."	1

"I never received the phone, which was delivered to the wrong address by the Post Office. The shipper, FlyStar, refused to take responsibility by either replacing the phone or refunding the money. Presumably, they would have insured the product, and accordingly they could have filed a claim with the Post Office, but they refused to even acknowledge  the error of the Post Office. "	0

"I opened a return request becaue I did not find a way to contact the seller, I purchased this Item with a confuse description, It said note I and Note II, I coould not make an agreement with the seller because I could not return the item because I am outside of the USA, I live in Dominican republic, since this seller made a mistake on a part the description, I wanted a part refund, the seller did not agree, so I lost many money on this. I think it was planned...    I think that this seller is paying for possitive feedback    Please help!"	0
I order this phone over 10 days and the don't send  it to  me 	0
"I ordered a ""brand new"" pixel phone from this seller for my son for Christmas.  It came and I wrapped it up and he opened it on Christmas morning.  He was incredibly excited and so surprised.   When I was setting up the phone I found a Verizon sim card in the sim slot...  I realized that this is a used phone.  Since my son was so excited and immediately started using the phone, I decided to contact the seller to let them know I received a used phone, not a new phone as advertised.  They told me they would give me a $10 credit (completely ridiculous since a used phone would sell for hundreds less) or I can send the phone back (which I wouldn't do since my son was attached to the phone at this point).  The right thing to do would be to refund me the difference in cost between what I paid and a used phone, but they refused.  I am so upset and would never buy anything from this seller again.  I hope at the very least some of you read this review and decide not to buy from them and I hope they lose revenue because of it.  I tried to resolve this with them but they did not want to resolve it.  This review is all I can do. "	0
"I ordered a Lumina Nokia 1020, and received a 909, If I had what I ordered I could upgrade the phone to windows 10 like my old 1020. I also bought the Square insurance. The seller won't respond. Guess I got ripped off."	0
I ordered a phone that would work with Staright talk - version.  It didn't work.  I had to go with AT&T.  What a crappy service in the area I live in.  I am very unhappy.	0
"I ordered an iPhone 6 plus and it arrived on June thrid however a week or two after receiving the phone it started having problems with the screen. The screen would not respond to my touch which I didn't think much of. Then two days ago the phone froze all together, I took it to get it looked and and I was told that I had a defective phone. You could imagine how upset I am when I haven't even had the phone for a month! "	0
I ordered I phone 8 amd he send to me awmty box of some another phone	0
I ordered phone and after I received it I was not satisfied with phone so I returned for refund and I still have not got credit back for it. I would never order from this company ever again I was very dissatisfied with their lack of customer service.	0
I ordered the phone in white but received gray instead. That just ruined the whole experience for me.	0
I ordered the unlocked smart phone but the phone I received is locked. when I insert simple mobile it says unknown Sim. so I want to return the phone	0
"I ordered this phone after a lot of research. He had a Galaxy 3 but it stopped working and we were looking for a cheaper option until we could upgrade our plan. After looking at a lot of different options I decided to go with the HTC Arrive.  The phone came very fast and overall was in great condition physically. However, we had to spend over two hours at Sprint trying to get it activated due to the age of the phone (none of the reps new how to work it) only to find out that the data did not work on it.   Both the Sprint store and customer service tried to fixed it but even after trial after trial (and 5 factory resets) we still could not get it to work.   Finally, we ended up having to pay sprint $75 to have it replaced. Which made the $88 phone ultimately cost $163, which is way too much for the product.   After replacing it, the data does in fact work, however he still can not send or receive picture messages or use certain features."	0
"I ordered this phone because it was the model that I have been using for 1 1/2 yrs. I knew the features of my old phone and wanted to buy the same one.  Unfortunately, this phone was not as advertised, so I returned it for a refund.  The seller had stated that it was a new phone, which is why I expected the original packaging, information manual and warranty information.  It arrived in the seller&apos;s own packaging with store bought accessories, not the original accessories and no manual."	0
"I ordered this phone to replace one just like it that I have finally worn out.  I love this phone!  It is easy to use, the battery lasts a long time, it takes great pictures, and it has a nice slim size, unlike many of the newer smart phones.  I reccomend this phone."	1
I ordered this same product a week earlier and was so impressed with the phone as described and new condition that I ordered another just for safe keeping. I was just as impressed with the second order as the first. This is how online shopping is suppose to be!!	1
I originally bidded on it because of the features it had. Seller says it works but I have no proof of it working.	0
"I owed 2 of these     they are  slow, locks up constantly  and lacks memory  worst  phones i ever owned"	0
"I owned this awhile back and got rid of it because I stopped using nET10 but heres the review I posted off of phonescoop.    There is nothing to not like about this phone. I didn&apos;t need a camera. I am a phone collector and reviewe and wanted to find some other phones for my collection- this came along and I was very impressed by net 10. It reminds me of the Nokia 1112 that is from telcel. It has the same games besides snake and still has rapid roll, but this phone has the color screen. Net10 realoly did a good job. Seeing as I only have had the phone for a day i cant really say, it&apos;s just kind of a little review.    The phone call quality is great, even in low reception areas where my verizon sch a870 has failed many times. This phone always gets the full bars.    The only real problem is that the phone can call people and dial numbers when in the pocket. However keypad lock, menu messages and the star key, locks it and fixes the problem, thats why it has a 4.5.    Net10 you did a great job. Great phone. Cool games and nice ringtone selections. It is even easy to text on.    30 cent plan is what I am on. Great little phone for a great price."	1
I PAID ALMOST $700 FOR A PHONE JUST TO HAVE IT MARKED STOLEN I NEED MY MONEY BACK AND I NEED IT NOW YOU DISHONEST THIEF!	0
I paid for faster shipping and it was still sent on economy. This is very frustrating and disappointing when I paid extra to get it faster and have to wait! This seller tried to trick me into paying more money for the phone that I bid on fair and square. Disappointing!	0
I paid for the iPhone 7 Plus 256Gb and he never send my phone he said that he sold to and other person. Then he ask for my email to sell me again the phone outside eBay to avoid fees ...... CAUTION 	0
I paid for this phome a long time ago and the seller refuses to ship. Keeps stalling	0
"I paid to have this ""new"" phone over nighted only for it to show up broken! Obviously needed the phone ASAP or I wouldn't have paid $50 shipping so return isn't an option. Don't waste your money "	0
I payed this item but i can&apos;t receive.    Seller sad that &quot;he was stolen from my home   along with some other things during a break in.&quot;	0
I picked this item because supposedly it comes from the US- the ad shows delivery within 5 days but I got it 3 weeks (!!!) later. Then I finally get it and it doesn't fit. My phone is a RS 43-335 (AS ADVERTISED BY THEM) the battery is way too small and the connector'd shape is unfit for my product	0
"I previously had a Nokia 6133, and was expecting the same quality phone.  The 2720 is awkward to open, and just feels wrong.  I want to open it up backwards because of the odd feel.  Several other people tell me the same thing with this model.  It also does&apos;t have a push button to pop it open when answering a call and is a clumsy two handed procedure.  The 2720 will take pictures, but has no way to put them on the computer other than to download them.  This takes forever, and I have only figured out how to do one at a time, and they have to be less than 100K.  With a 1.3 meg camera, this doesn&apos;t work too well.  There are no memory chips.  The 6133 had a socket for a memory chip, and I could download 100 or more pictures in a few minutes.  I ordered parts and a tool to repair my old 6133 and can&apos;t wait to get it working again.  Even the 6133 is not waterproof."	0
I purchase it for a gift when I am out of the country. I sent to my best friend. He found out it is not working all. And he sent to repair shop. The technician told him it looks very old and has a lot of dust in it. My friend was very angry about it. It damaged our friendship. I fell so bad! 	0
I purchased 2 phone cards like these ones from this seller and his were fake and he never responded to my e-mails  do not buy them	0
"I purchased a factory refurbished Motorola Q phone and am pretty disappointed in it.  The cost from the e bay dealer was low ($65), and the dealer was excellent, but if it were not for the low cost factor, I would have felt ripped off.  The dealer happily replaced the phone with another Motorola Q when I reported that the battery life was very poor.  He sent out another unit, but it is the same problem.     The longest talk time you can expect from a Q is around 40-50 minutes, and that is without any extraneous activities like taking pictures, web browsing, texting, etc.  If you use any functions other than talking, you can see battery life drop to a 25-35 minutes.  I have not used the Cricket broad band service before having it on this phone, but I can tell you that it is a joke.   If you are planning to surf the web using Cricket broad band, forget it.  It is essentially worthless, and even thought it adds only about 6 bucks to your monthly bill, it is not worth even that.  The Motorola Q is thin, attractive, and cool looking, but I would not recommend it, unless you do like I did, and buy a factory refurbished unit for as cheap as you can get it, which is available for $60-75.  At that price, it&apos;s not a bad phone, and better than other new phones with fewer features.  Just don&apos;t pay the new list price of around $200.  You can do better for those dollars."	0
I purchased a Palm Treo 755 (Sprint)  Phone was in excellent condition.  Delivery was very fast and I had no problems connecting it.  Phone included charger and other accesories.  Very pleased with the purchase.	1
I purchased a used phone from this seller that I was told would not work in the USA but in any other country using GSM. I bought the phone and shipped to a friend in the Phillipines. The phone does not work and the seller is aware they sold me a damaged phone. They are refusing to reimburse me for the expense of returning the phone. I have had more than one conversation with Ebay help desk and they are refusing do not  expect Ebay to be of any help at all. In fact I spoke to them a few days ago and they were to contact the seller and get back to me as of today that has not happened. I would be very wary of this seller and do not ha expect any help from Ebay when you do have a problem.	0
"I purchased and paid immediately.  Seller was very slow to respond and had many excuses as to why it hadn't shipped.  Long story short, I was refunded by eBay after 2 weeks.  Bad business all the way. "	0
I purchased it... and I am at Barrow Alaska .. and there is no service for this phone at all for the State of Alaska...     So now I have a phone that is not useful for me at all..  this is why I put &quot;poor&quot; for rating .. after the purchase thru ebay.	0
"I purchased the blue phone, not the red.  I purchased this phone as a replacement for a friend who has had the same phone for some time and can&apos;t find anything he likes as well.  Extremely happy with the phone."	1

"I purchased this Alcatel one touch for my mother,she had one and damaged it so I bought her the same one. It's a simple basic cell phone and does everything she needs, talk and txt. "	1
I purchased this device for my 9yrd old daughter for christmas and 1 day before delivery the seller canceled my order. Now I let other good buys end/expire. This is a huge disappointment 	0
I PURCHASED THIS ITEM  COME TO FIND OUT IT MUST BE A DEFECTIVE ONE THEY SAID NEW THEY LIED THIS PHONE HAS BEEN ON CHARGE FOR HOURS AND IT STILL HAVE NOT GOTTEN TO HALF A CHARGE HATE I EVEN PURCHASED IT CANT SEND IT BACK THEY SAY NO REFUND NOW I KNOW WHY THEY KNEW IT WAS CRAP FROM THE BEGINNING THATS WHY THEY DIDNT SEND A CHARGER WITH IT	0
"I purchased this item it said it had wifi, I though oh that&apos;s nice very affordable price i&apos;ll purchase it. only to find out there is not wifi as the specs. specified. it cost more to return the product. Very disappointing. and to make it worst the sellers doesn&apos;t want to take the blame for it. Ok fine they refunded me after I stick in their ass on a number of occasions $40.00 and we discussed $45.00. Lying. I will not purchase another one and won&apos;t recommend it to anyone. To make it worst I inquired if they&apos;re sure it has wifi, and is whatsapp compatable. They said yes. It freezes, can&apos;t see my memory card."	0
"I purchased this phone a month ago. The phone has good battery life but cracks easily. The phone was in a phone wallet and dropped from less than a foot, shattered in several different places as shown in the attached photo. I am very disappointed with this product."	0
I purchased this phone and took the seller two weeks to say that my product is sent to wrong address and I am very disappointed about this.	0
"I purchased this phone because a friend had one and I was extremely impressed with the quality of the pictures taken with the Note 5.  The phone is in excellent condition and works just like new.  I am familiar with the Samsung line, all our phones and tablets are Samsung, so there were no surprises.  The battery life on the Note 5 is not quite as good as the S-5 that my husband has, but it's worth it for the better camera, and it charges super fast!"	1
"I purchased this phone because it was advertised as New/Old stock.  I will say that the phone did look very good, but it was DOA. I contacted the seller, and he actually sent me another phone as soon as I dropped off the old phone at package store. The new phone was a different model and actually a later model. I was able to get this phone working to some extent, but it wouldn't keep any settings, and it kept coming up in Demo Mode. I took it to Verizon, and they told me it was likely a phone stolen from a store, and there was nothing they could do to make a demo phone into a standard phone.  Once again I had to return a phone to this seller.  I reread the reviews, and it seems that multiple customers reported similar or worse experiences.   For whatever it's worth, I did get my money back, and the seller seemed genuinely sorry about the problems. "	0
"I purchased this phone for my 11 year old so she would have a slide out to replace her old cell.  I researched many phones but went with this one because it has: 1) Music player 2) camera  3) video recorder 4) it texts 5) Amazon.com and other reviews 6) cost because it is an older model it was less expensive.  It works great and does more than she needs it to do right now; like internet or e-mail, but the functions are there when I want to set them up.  I don&apos;t really have any complaints because the things I wish were there I knew were not there when I selected this phone which was $20.00 during Feb. 2011 here on Ebay (It had a few scratches on the screen, but unnoticsble when phone is in use.)  It would have been nice to have MMS smileys work or a touch screen but its for a a tween not a geeky adult like myself. Samsung T369 did not disappoint! (P.S. she loves the dural slide out)"	1
"I purchased this phone for my husband to replace the phone he lost that was exact same model. Ad claims phone is &quot;NEW&quot; but we received it loose in a small box, not in original packaging. Phone is obviously used, it only works part of the time &amp; as time has passed since we bought it little over a month ago, it works less &amp; less, loosing signal at any given time. It will not pick up wi-fi signals. I have the exact same phone &amp; have never had any issues with mine nor did my husband till he lost his. If you purchase one of these phones from this seller &amp; it is not in AT&amp;T blister pack when you receive it - RETURN IT!!!"	0
"I purchased this phone for my wife to replace one just like it that she lost.  It is stated that the phone is factory unlocked but when I went to get a new SIM card, they put it in and told me that the phone needs to be unlocked.  As it is right now, it can only be used on the AT&T network.    The only contact information listed for the seller is a phone number.  I've called it multiple times but never get an answer and there is no way to leave a message.  It rings about a dozen times and then asked me for an access code.    So now I have to go pay AT&T additional money to unlock the supposedly unlocked device that I purchased since I can't get in contact with this seller.    Had I known that I would either have to pay to get it unlocked or get an AT&T contract, I would have bought this product from a different seller.    Really bummed about this purchase.."	0
I purchased this phone in mid Febuary and the touch screen is already messed up. I had to purchase another phone to replace it. My advise is not to buy this type of phone.	0
I purchased this phone on eBay and it is probably the best phone that I have ever had.  It is so fast.	1
"I purchased this phone to save money by using the wi-fi feature. After setting it up, the phone did not  preform as well as expected. It would switch from my home wireless network back to t-mobile in the middle of a call and then drop it.  At work it was even worse. It connected to the wireless network but   the strength was to low to get a good signal. I spoke with T-mobile and they were aware of the issues.  I think this is a good idea that&apos;s a little ahead of it&apos;s time."	0
"I purchased this product (Samsung Galaxy S6 Active cell phone)for a Christmas gift for my niece. Only to experience the worst ordeal,  the phone is not coming, at all. I lived in the Caribbean so the costs of the phone was a lot to reach me. Now I have to spend additional expense to try and get the cell phone working.  It was such a disappointment, further, being the first time purchasing form Ebay. I would not or ever recommend anyone to purchase any thing from this sight. Very dissatisfied customer. I wish I got of removed all the stars but you much at least choose one...."	0
"I purchased three different used Samsung SCH700 Gleam phones on e-bay that were described as being in excellent condition and had to return each one. The first phone, the seller reported that he dropped it and it broke.  The second phone did not work at all.  The battery was swelled and did not even fit in the phone properly.  The third phone powered up but would not receive a cell signal indicating a possible broken internal antenna."	0
"I pushed 1 too many buttons on a locked phone and it transformed into a FROZEN phone which, 2 techs told me,  was too old to bother with because they no longer had scripted instructions  to open it . Said i could try the manufacturer , but recommended i just get another phone.  My sister had been using one and liked it OK,   cheap $15 buy on ebay, but holding it in my hand...I thought the buttons were TOO tiny ( smart phone sooo much better!) "	0
"I rarely write reviews, however I have to write one to share my experience.   Phone: I have used LG phones for a while now, the last LG phone I used was LG-V20, V-20 was an exellent phone but the V-30 has taken it to a different level. First the screen is bigger, the battery life lasts longer and charges faster. Camera is excellent, front and back! And the speed of the phone has also improved.  Seller The seller replied to all my questions, and even though' there was a delay in shipping, it was due to circurmstances that the seller did not have control over (bad weather). Nevertheless, the seller kept me updated through out the whole process. The phone I received is new and has T-mobile original packaging.    "	1
"I read and followed the directions. The phone doesnt turn on, what should be expected for a $10.00 phone. It is not worth the time to return."	0
I really appreciate the fast delivery and the extra stuff with it thank you very much.	1
I really do not like this phone. It doesn&apos;t download any of my picture mail and it doesn&apos;t store alot of text messages.  It really isn&apos;t what I expected	0
"I really enjoy this phone. This is a good one so I encourage people to buy it. It has a good camera, the battery is really good. the price also is good. It is a simple phone with a lot of great qualities."	1

I really like the phone. It would have been a really great phone if it would have been GSM Unlocked like the seller said it was. But was not able to use the phone.	0
"I really like this phone, thou the battery needs a lot of help. I had to buy a battery case for it cause I have tho charge it like 3 times a day. The bring phone up tio ur ear to answer calls doesn't work for some dumb reason. Takes great pics, the pics attached I was about 300 ft. away from the elk. Really like that U can change to a wide angle or use the regular lense. Great screen quality and brightness"	1
I really like this phone. It is not to big or to little and is very uncomplicated to use. 	1
"I really liked all that it offered, but the screen had some lines down it after one simple small drop, that didn&apos;t even mark up the phone. I&apos;d advise against this phone!"	0
"I really liked this phone it was in good condition, very easy to manuver and convienent to have. especially because it had a keyboard for typing and then slide down so that u could dial to make a call but could be used either way or u could just use the front of the phone to call."	1
"I really love my phone, highly recommended."	1
"I really love to use this phone. It&apos;s a complete remake of the S700/S710, with Walkman features. Although it lacks 850MHz, it is still good overall, so for all the people going to Asia during the summer break, the 3G is a really nice advantage.    Also, this cool phone packs a nice 2MP camera with auto-focus and macro.    With around 500MB built in memory, you don&apos;t have to spend too much extra money for a bigger memory card, but I just bought a 4GB memory stick pro duo that recently came out.    I would say that this is overall an excellent phone, and Sony Ericsson&apos;s UI is very easy to use and even I learned without an instruction manual.    If you want to drop the 3G, built-in memory, and swivel phone, I&apos;d really recommend the Sony Ericsson W810i, has all the same features except 3G, built-in memory, and it&apos;s a clamshell, but it comes with a 512MB memory card."	1
"I really thought this would be a nice phone - and it probably is, but 7 weeks after I ordered and paid for it I still haven&apos;t received it. The seller is in Hong Kong and there seems to be a problem with post coming from there to the UK.    If it arrives I will be able to say how good it is !"	0

I received a  phone that  did not work I sent phone back .after 2 months I am still waiting on a refund 	0
"I received a fake phone. It was 3g not 4g. The camera was worse than an old Nokia phone. The sound quality is horrible. The screen does not rotate, the screen is plastic the resolution is terrible, the battery life is horrendous and the ""Samsung"" box had two misspellings including the word more was spelled ""mor"" and my call log where the calls came in from USA it showed the us numbers but was naming cities in china. This was a very cheap knock off. It seems like they didn't even trying just built the worse phone ever and put samsung covers on it. "	0
I received blackberry pearl 8110. It was nice. Can trust this seller he is good. I received my item in 3 days. it was fast	1
"I received my Moto Z9 from AT&amp;T, this phone has all the features you would expect from a non-PDA phone but I find it clumsy and too big to carry.  I know that it has GPS, but I do expect to use that feature unless I suddenly find myself lost in the woods - and knowing AT&amp;T; I probably wouldn&apos;t get signal there anyway.     I recently upraded from a Sony/Ericcson W580i which was wonderful.  I was primarily looking for call clarity to reduce dropped calls and to reduce noise.  I was told by the techs at AT&amp;T that the network in my area (Sacramento, CA) suffers from severe bandwidth issues due to them losing 1/2 of all their towers when their lease expired with T-Mobile in Feb of 2008, and further degraded in June of 2008 when millions of iPhones attached to their 3G network.     Despite the clams by Motorola about their crystal clear technology, I found the reception and clarity of the Z9 no better than my Sony.    The bluetooth feature seemed to link very good with my Plantronics 521, and I was able to hear the call as good as talking on the headset.  It has a very good range too.    The camera has all the same problems of any camera phone, and the pictures are OK.  There is a built in video light next to the camera that would be more helpful as a flash. And you cannot turn the camera shutter noise off.  On the plus side, I would imagine that you could use the video light as an emergency flashlight.    The user tools such as Calendar are not as good as expected.  I Purchased the Motorols Phone tools v. 5.0 software and it took me nearly two hours to install and my computer had trouble connecting with the phone.  It successfully synced about 95% of my Outlook calendar and appointment data, but errored on some appointments due to a &quot;fields not supported&quot; error.  Even worse it did not tell me which appointments it couldn&apos;t sync, making my phone calendar unreliable as I still need to check Outlook everyday for appointment data.    Overall I&apos;d give it a C-, for the size and cost it would make sense to buy an iPhone or Blackberry."	0
I received my phone in perfect condition and in good timing. :) This was my first time buying through ebay.	1
"I received my phone very quickly from the seller. I am disappointed in the condition. It was listed as GOOD, so I did not expect a new phone, but this phone should be listed in FAIR condition. The screen has several scratches, a couple of which are pretty bad. The quality of shipping was also poor, damaged box, dusty phone, stuffed in a mailing envelope. If I could have seen this phone in advance I would not have purchased. I have never had an issue buying used phones on ebay before. I will be more selective next time, and will avoid this vendor. The price was very good, but there were may options at or close to this price point."	0
I received the cellphone with the LCD broken!	0
"I received the item with a bad mic, I have turned the device off and on, clear debris from the port while the device is turned off. I also have looked at many forums about this problem and tried all the possible solutions but none have worked for me. I contacted the seller and wrote a negative review as well but he hasn't responded. Over all good phone but terrible Samsung customer service as well as seller communications.      "	0
I received the phone 10 days after paying it. He said the phone was one week used and that come with charger but I check the guarantee in the apple and I have just one additional month and the charger didn't come. 	0
I received the phone but it didn't work	0
I received the phone promplty and it was better than expected the price was in my range and I could&apos;nt be happier.	1
I received the phone within a few days after ordering.  The phone seemed to be just like new as well.  I would like to have known that the phone came from a smoker&apos;s home because when i opened the package it reaked of smoke.  Other than that it was really a good buy.  Thanks!	1
I received the wrong phone but it was an honest mistake. Seller took care of the problem promptly and was very communicative and helpful in the process.	1
I received this phone but when I tried to activate the phone I received the message that it was reported lost or stolen so I sent it back to the seller.    Completely dissatified.  Seller should be aware of the status of the phone.	0

I received what I bought.  Thanks for quick shipping.	1
I recently bought this phone and returned it. It&apos;s supper laggy and I had a lot of problem with it. No i wasn&apos;t expecting it to be the best of the best..i mean its a fake I-phone... but i also didn&apos;t expect it to be so bad o.o. I don&apos;t think i&apos;d recommend this phone for anyone.  I&apos;m just happy the seller was willing to work things out in the end.  My suggestion is add another $20-50 bucks and get a better phone.	0
"I recently purchased a Motorlola Cell phone for my daughter, least to say she loved it.  It had the perfect features she was looking for. One setback not the sellers fault was that when she went to change the phone for use the cricket store said it was not usable in our area.  What a shame."	1
"I recently purchased this phone new off of eBay.  I knew that it was a popular phone in Europe (SL55) and I wanted to try out a slider.  Pros: compact and stylish.  Decent reception and easy to hear caller.  Cons: Short battery life, easy to crack face, somewhat complicated menu functions (hard to find what you&apos;re looking for).  Definetly have a manual with this one.  Lets just say that I would own another one if this broke.  UPDATE:  I had this phone for about three months and it started falling apart.  I basically had to replace all of the parts on it one by one before I finally gave up on it.  I hated this phone by the end of it all.  I would avoid buying it."	0
I recieved the cell phone this thursday and it is in the condition that was stated and I will throughly enjoy fixing it. I will buy from the seller again. I just would be nice if people would quit artifically inflating the price of the auction phones.	1

"I rescently bought a Sanyo RL-4930 cell phone. I had one before, but it got damaged. So I went on Ebay to find another. I love this phone because it it sturdy with rubber wrapped all around it. Has a battery that last a very long time. I dont have texting or any of the bells and whistles. I just like it because it&apos;s just a good phone. If I wanted, I could get the frills, internet etc, but I only use it to contact friends and family. Simply a great phone. Bill."	1

"I see you bided on an item and retracted your bid.  You can do that. You bid on the item and then asked a question. You only have 1 hour to retract your bid and have to have just cause. You do not have just cause to retract your bid. You have to pay the $85.00 buy now price because, you have caused him not to be able to sell the phone. Straight talk requires all cell phone be activated in 21 days or they get blocked. The ones you buy from Wal Mart. As matter of fact Wal Mart is only place that sells straight talk cell phone besides from starighttalk.com  I was going to bid on your item but if you can not be trusted to pay for your bids then I dont trust you to mail mine item if I bid. My son is an attorney. He said you have to pay for phone since you bid before asking anything. So you lost a sell because you are dishonest. You mother in law should be happy to have a cell phone. You are a very dishonest person."	0
I sent it back did not meet the requirements stated in description! Would not recommend this seller!!!FFFF++++	0
"I set my phones to ring and vibrate. When I recharge this phone it resets itself to &quot;Loud&quot; but does not ring at all. Fortunately the voice mail catches the call. I missed a few calls before I figured out what the defect was.    It came with two batteries. Good thing, under minimal use, one battery just isn&apos;t enough.    The phone was not expensive. As long as I carry an extra battery, or car charger and keep an eye on the settings, it may be worth the price."	0
"I so much love this phone I bought another.  Love the design, features, extras, shape, feel, quality--everything."	1

I think it is the worse phone ever. Fake advertisement by sellers. The phone battery is the worse ever; how can they sell a phone that the battery last only 20 minutes in a good day. I tried 3 different phone and all of them have the same battery problem. Those sellers should stop using false advertisement.	0
"I think its the best phone:  easy to use,  everything you need at your fingertips,  easy access to the Internet,  good camera,  very nice design.  I love the company Apple"	1

"I thought this would be a cool phone. But it was garbage in the US and should have never been advertised to work with T-Mobil. It didn&apos;t and returned it! Also mine was a refurbished phone. as most seller are selling, which is not a big deal they just need to say that they are non usable in the US with any service and that you are going to need to return it. And be honest with your customers. Buyer Beware!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11"	0

"I understand its a roll of the dice when it comes to buying, Especially on Ebay,....My Wife needed A replacement Phone, and we came across this one in question, apparently attempting to save over a new unit. This cell PHONE was advertised as mint Condition,.. which it wasn&apos;t.More like a piece of Shit... it was pretty much beat to hell. Less then half the life left,.. we kept it Anyways, as a back up Battery/charger, and it also came with a Bonus DVD Oceans Eleven . So it wasn&apos;t such Major lost, Still it was a learning experience,... Buyer Beware...."	0
I upgraded from a S5. I like the panorama shot the S5 offered. I miss it in this phone. Just learning how to set up the apps and getting to them is a hassle right now. Good phone.	1

I use them for my employees that work out of the office because The Rugby can take a lot of abuse. I use an iphone because it's easier for me.	1
"I used my girlfriends iphone 4 and i instantly fell in love with it. the graphics are so advanced, and the phone is great! the battery life lasted 2 days!This phone is great and is very fast too!"	1
"I Used this phone a LONG time ago, and it was always fun to use. It had a cool camera, and fun phone to text on, and was durable. I smacked it on the asphalt accidentally, when I jumped and it fell out of my front pocket *gulp* and it was seperated on the side, but put it all back together and it turned on and worked as it was designed. it was a very good phone."	1
"I used to have this phone before, but mine broke... so later after my new phone that I&apos;ve had for 6 months got stolen, I decided to go back to this one. It has a lot of pretty ring tones and alarms, the UI is easy to follow and it&apos;s got some interesting backgrounds/themes. It has a nice feel to it overall- it feels cool to just hold it, idk what material it&apos;s made of but it&apos;s very silky and smooth. Easy to text with, not my old qwerty keyboard, but still acceptable. Camera sucks, but what else would you expect from less than 2 mega pixels? Also it&apos;s not always quick to flip it open without longer fingernails, you&apos;ve gotta work at it sometimes... but NEVER long enough to actually miss a call or something like that.  It&apos;s a good phone to keep on hand in case your phone of choice breaks/gets stolen/lost; it&apos;s a nice fall back. Overall: I love this phone!"	1
"I waited awhile to send in the review because I wanted to make sure the LGVX4400 cell phone was in good working condition, and it has been working well.  No complaints.  The delivery time was excellent.  I would have no problem in dealing with Planetinstock again."	1
I want a simple small phone and this LG phone I could not find it anywhere else.  It is beautifully refurbished and working perfectly!  This is the second time I bought cell phone from you.  Thank you!	1
I want to buy this iPhone does it come with headphones and lightning cable and it's it officially seal ? 	1
I want to review product however.....I have not received any communication on why this has not been shipped. Ebays policies are even lacking here. I purchased because delivery date was between 14 to 17th of dec. But it is now the 21st. This was a gift. Now its to late to order another. This seller has disappointed me. Not one bit of communication is really upsetting. Now i have to figure out what else to do about this gift. I certainly with never buy from this seller again.	0
I wanted a easy smart phone. This phone is easy to learn and easy to navigate. The only downside is battery life.	1
"I wanted a touchscreen phone but didnt want to spend the money on an iphone. the finesse is an affordable alternative for an iphone. you do get what you pay for though. one of the things i dislike is that it does take longer to surf the net and when you finally get to the site that you want, it is too small to look at. i stick to phone calls and texting."	1
I wanted more that BOLD.  I like because is better than BOLD  Faster than olders version of BlackBerries.	1
"I wanted to pick up the iphone, but the seller hasn&apos;t wanted it to give to me. Very bad seller. very bad bad bad"	0
I was a little apprehensive about buying a touch screen LG however the responsive time is way better then an LG touch phone released to date. The camera sucks even though it is a 3.0 MP. FM radio works great and it is easy to personalize. I do have to say that I am disappointed but the service I received from the seller. I bought for digikarma because they had lots of positive reviews and only a hand full of negatives unfortunately I had a not so great experience. I order a pink LG KP500 on 06/16/2009 and PAID for shipping to received the phone in 3-4 business days and it took 8 days to actually received the phone however I got the bonus antenna booster in 3 days. Ha Ha. I emailed them and got a prompt response but what really upset me is that I never received a shipping number for my phone just the antenna booster till I emailed them. Not only that they sent me a SILVER KP500 when I ordered a PINK and I don&apos;t have the time to wait possibly two weeks to return and have a new one shipped because my other phone broke and need it on me because of family emergencies. I feel like I got played a little bit. This was my first time buying on Ebay and I was so stressed that I got screwed from this transaction that I will never do it again.	0
I was able to get my hands on my phone after the 30 day return period since I was out of the country and was surprised to find out that the phone was locked to an unspecified carrier. I had to pay unlocking services and seller didn't provide me with any other option because I reported the incident after 2 months. Mainly my bad for not reporting soon but was really disappointed because I was supposed to be buying an unlocked phone from the first place. Description of the item was unreliable in this regard.	0
I was counting on getting this phone for my granddaughters birthday. I won the auction and paid immediately. This was on Saturday and he said he would ship Monday. Still not shipped on Tuesday and then cancelled order with no explanation 	0
I was disappointed to learn that the phone had been exposed to water and it was not mentioned in the ad. I thought the only issue was a cracked screen. Not very nice to withhold vital information like that.	0

"i was given a refund, but i really wanted the phone"	0
I was hoping to have 8gb available for apps/internal storage but found the device uses 3.7gb for the OS!  Leaving about 4gb for everything else.  That is in contrast to another android phone i purchased a while back that was advertised as having 4gb available internal storage.  It DID have 4gb of available storage (the OS was not included as part of the available internal storage). So it really is not a 8gb internal storage on this device...it's 4gb after the OS space is used up.	0
I was in need of a phone and when I saw the Samsung SGH A877 Impression I immediately loved it. I like the touch screen features and the full keypad. It&apos;s great!	1

"I was looking for a replacement for my Samsung Galaxy S3 after I dropped it a couple of times and the screen cracked badly. I had it for some time but it was a great phone. I wanted one with a bigger screen like the Samsung Galaxy J7. But its expensive. The LG Stylo 2, LG Tribute HD, and LG X Power were phones that I was interested in. My wife has the LG Stylo 2 and its awesome. I was really tempted to get the LG Stylo 2 but I didnt want to copy her. Even though I compared the specs with the ZTE Warp 7 with other phones, I thought that it was a cheap brand and because it looked cheap in the pictures. I just bought it recently when it dropped to $49.00 at Best Buy. This is the best Smartphone that I have ever had! The phone is so sleek looking and comfortable to hold. For just $49, this smartphone has a huge 5.5 inch IPS LCD display that shows incredible graphics. Im addicted to playing Temple Run 2 because it has such an amazing display on this phone and Ive never played games on a cell phone before. The 13 MP rear camera and 5MP front camera has multiple effects such as: pro mode- grid, gradienter, ISO, white balance, and exposure, fun mode- panorama, HDR, effect (lomo, sephia, comic, mirror, fisheye, and more), multi exposure, macro, and smile. It has a super-fast processo"	1
"I was looking for the best value to add time to my Tracfone and I liked the plans that were good for a year. I found this package deal for the LG Treasure and 1350 minutes, 1350 texts, and 1350 megabytes of data for $79.95. The card to add time and minutes to my old phone was $99.95 for the one year plan and it only came with 1200 minutes and 1200 texts. This was a great deal and the LG Treasure is a great phone. It is larger than my old phone which is great for an old man and has all the features that my wife's phone from the big carrier has. Thank you Tracfone! "	1
"I was more than happy with my purchase, there was a &quot;scratch&quot; on the scroll pad, it turned out to be the protective film that was still on there. I removed the film, and the phone was brand new again. I would most definitely send someone to this seller for a phone purchase."	1
I was not able to obtain a users manual because it was an international cell phone so i returned it.	0
"I was not impresssed with the phone.  The seller states the phone is ""Brand New"", however the phone did not require updating.  A Brand New phone out of the box will always require updating.

"I was really impressed when I opened the first iPhone 5s as the condition and the screen was in amazing condition.  I was extremely disappointed with the second phone, body was beat up and the screen was burnt across the top portion of the screen.

"I was scared to get an used iPhone off of Ebay, but I'm so glad I did.  There was a tiny scratch on the back, but otherwise the phone looks new.  The battery life is very long.  Like the photo, it came with Apple-brand headphones and charger.  "	1

"I was sold a lemon. I bought it because I was tired of losing phones, and this was a cheap and easy option. In my mind Nokias are supposed to be durable and last a lifetime. Well, this phone was terrible. Came with no instructions, just two batteries, very used condition unlike what the seller site said, and it stopped working less than a week from its purchase date. I bought another Nokia at Best Buy for the same price, and it&apos;s worked perfectly. Never again."	0

I went to try to use this device on an independent carrier and they gave me a cell number and everything was suppose to be set.  It wasn't so they transferred me to their tec support and they informed me that the device was too old to work on the new 3G and 4G network that AT&T uses.  So now I have a cell phone to no where.  	0

I will NEVER buy from this AMZWIRELSS again. I purchased a phone and within two weeks the buttons stopped working. I wrote a negative review and once the seller saw it he asked if I would change the review. He said if I changed the review he would ship me a phone over night. It&apos;s been over two weeks and I still haven&apos;t received the phone!	0

"I worked for Verizon Wireless during 2 phases of this phone and a refurb phase. This phone got terrible reception. It was staticy and dropped calls continuously. It&apos;s not just the network or the seller...sometimes ya just get a bad model of phones. Thus far, I have tested 8 LG phones (VX9800, VX7000, VX6100, VX6000, VX3200, VX3100, VX4500B, VX4500A) and the 3100 was the worst of them all. It&apos;s screen loses brightness, it is EXTREMELY sensitive to moisture and shows &quot;water damage&quot; with even mild condensation when being left in a car overnight..not to mention terrible reception. Before you buy this phone, beware and do not blame the seller or Verizon. The blame is with LG for releasing a P!55 poor product."	0
I would charge the phone till it gets too 100% and it wold die literally in 5 minutes  	0
"I WOULD HAVE LIKED IT,IF I COULD HAVE ACTIVATED IT.EVERYTIME I TRIED THEY SAID IT WAS A PREPAID PHONE.I SOLD IT, THEN HAD TO PAY THEM BACK BECAUSE THEY COULDN&apos;T ACTIVATE IT EITHER."	0
I would like recommend people to do business with this seller because I am very satisfied with the product and business communications.	1
I would like to return this item and exchange it for a new one. It has not worked correctly since I received it. I thought it was something I was doing wrong but after bringing it to a cell phone store and they could not figure it out I've decided it's not me. Please email what I need to do to replace this item.	0
I would love to review it but I never received it; I think I was scammed out of $410. I have filed a case with eBay; very disappointed and doesn&apos;t give me much confidence to buy a major item through eBay again. I&apos;ve always ordered with confidence and have never had any problem. Now this. Sorry.	0
I WOULD NOT BUY THIS PHONE IT TURNS ON &amp; OFF BY ITS SELF U CAN BE TALKING O TEXTING &amp; THEN IT COMES BACK ON	0
I would not recommend purchasing a product like this because an unlocked phone is worthless if it&apos;s reported atolen. You can&apos;t do anything with it. You have no protection for your hard earned money	0
"I would say I m a collector of phones, from the latest to the vintage. The Sony W300i is small and simple in design. Loaded with features some of the more expensive phones might have. It fits securely in your hand, buttons seem to work, well and the menu is set up in a logical manner. You can also sync it with Outlook, for contacts and notes. Even though the phone has a plastic lightweight feel, it is made pretty well. The unlocked version works with any GSM service and its a great phone to use with a prepay. Four bands enables you to take it to Europe, just place a new sym card and your all set. Starts up fast. Camera is a little week but adequate for a quick snapshot. Thumbs Up on this phone."	1
I wouldn&apos;t know because the ebayer sold me a phone that has been reported lost or stolen by Verizon Wireless.	0
"I wouldnt know I never received it. I purchased the phone on december 23. I got several emails saying that they were out of stock, that they would refund me or send me one when it came in. Then on Jan 3 I received an email stating the item had been shipped. It never came. I gave it several weeks, then looked it up by the tracking number. It was returned to shipper."	0
"I&apos;m a big guy, I have big fingers and no patience. This phone had a really nice screen, it is not a fatty like the other phones, the screen is not full of sharp pixels, it actually has a high definition feel to it, it has some kind of blurring that makes it above the other phones.    The phone is really great! I love every single thing about it, I actually own two of them, it is a great buy, and I will even unlock it and use it with my future network if I ever switch.    If you want to get a phone, and it really doesn&apos;t matter to you if it has touchscreen or any of that fancy stuff, this phone is for you!    Did I mention it is very durable? My old one got ran over by my friend&apos;s Bronco, and it still works.    The only negative, is that the A707 tends to break the front screen on certain drops, so be careful not to drop it, buy a mask for it off of eBay!"	1
I&apos;m enjoying my new phone. I did have a proble w/ it being really slick so I had to had a case for it. But since then it has been great. I&apos;m still getting to know how to use the phone. The battery does NOT last long though.  The seller sent it out right away which was really nice to received quickly.	1
I&apos;m happy whit my cell... thanks  I&apos;m happy whit my cell... thanks  excellent service!!    I recomend this... so good	1
I&apos;m not very happy with this phone. I loose service frequently and sometimes have a hard time with receiving calls and not being able to hear the person on the other line. I wouldn&apos;t know recommend this phone!	0
"I&apos;m sorry but I HAVE the Crush, and most of the time I just want to CRUSH it, I can&apos;t check my voice mail from it because the screen goes blk when I make a call and I can&apos;t type in my password, there are times I try to make a call and it won&apos;t dial the number, then I have to turn it off and turn it back on. It is the WORST cell phone I have ever owned, and I have seen A LOT of other complainants about this phone, and very few of the opposite. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS TOUCH PHONE TO ANYONE, YOU WANT A GOOD TOUCH SCREEN PHONE GET THE LG BLISS."	0
I&apos;m very disappointed with this purchase. As of today I did not get item saying that I did not give correct address. But it was not my fault. Local post office changed their policy and given address became void.I did wrote to seller requesting for reposting but no response. I&apos;m willing to bear additional postage cost.	0
"I&apos;m very unsatisfied with it. It constantly drops calls, battery dies after one phone call and it makes a very weird noise in the background.I sended this phone back but he never returned my money."	0
I&apos;ve been using my EVO for a couple weeks now and I am very happy with the ease of use and function of this phone.  I would highly recomend an EVO to anyone considering an android smart phone.  You will be opened up to a whole new world of apps as well as brousing and messaging.  So if you are looking for the hottest phone out there look no farther than the EVO.	1
"I&apos;ve had every phone and operating system over the years and I must say, this wasn&apos;t what I was expecting from windows. My most recent change from Android 4 and IOS 6 has been a pleasant surprise. I haven&apos;t found too many things this phone WON&apos;T open (common occurrence with IOS) and syncing with the phone is flawless. My business mail is more reliable than IOS (which I thought was perfect) and calls are always strong and clear.  The system never slows down, never hangs or stutters, and I only reboot because I think its a good idea....not because I have to. Battery is better than average for what I&apos;m used to but could be better. It&apos;s definitely better than Android and probably on par or a little better than IOS. This phone hasn&apos;t left me lacking in any way since I&apos;ve had it. I&apos;ve always been a fan of Nokia since back in the day and I think I will continue that now with this phone lineup.  If you want or need something different than Android and IOS and haven&apos;t liked Windows phones in the past, I highly recommend the Windows phones now because they are NOTHING like the old windows. Our company is slowing phasing out IOS to this platform due to less problems and better compatibility.  They are just rock solid phones."	1
"i&apos;ve had nothing but problems with the phone that i&apos;ve ordered.when they sent it to me it wsa missing the battery cover,when i called to retrieve it they said that it doesn&apos;t come with one and i would have to buy my own.when i tried to use it it didn&apos;t work so i sent it back.when they sent me it for the second time they sent the same one back hoping it would work,it didn&apos;t so i had to send it back again.the sent me a brand new phone  again and come to find out just yesterday that this one doesn&apos;t work neither.i&apos;m going to ask for a full refund now beings i&apos;m tired of sending it back,and they still haven&apos;t paid for my shipping and handeling."	0
"I&apos;ve had this phone for about a year and a half. The case is not durable at all. My casing has several knicks in it just from normal use and half of it is peeled off. My battery life started decreasing about 4 months ago. I can only talk for about 20 minutes before it completely dies. It also tends to change ringing styles without me or anything touching it. The only good thing about it, which actually just might be Verizon, is I got service in the middle of the ocean while on a cruise while no one else did, but besides that, there are no other perks. My suggestion? Don&apos;t waste money on this phone,you can get a much better phone for the same price."	0
"I&apos;ve only had the Samsung Moment for a brief time. So far, I like the cell phone. I especially like the keyboard and how it feels. The price I paid was great. At this very moment I currently do not have any dislike at this time. The seller shipped the cell phone in a reasonable time frame. My experience has been great. Peace Be Unto You"	1
I&apos;ve used this model since 2010. It has everything one needs to keep in touch and keep up with the world&apos;s retarded pace. I love that it has everything expected from a mobile device plus more.	1

if i did not have 2 wait a month 4 it may be i could have used it	0
"if i would have known this phone was in this bad of shape, i would not have bought it,  your description of it was way too kind! any way you can trade me for a better one?  i was shocked when i opened the bag.  i will probably never ever purchase anything ever again on ebay. also my bad, it did not have a charger with it, my fault. be very careful when you read the description."	0
"if its your lucky day I answer.   Yep I can here you now, loud and clear! Easy buttons to push and operate by sight, feel, and guides you cant miss.      This is my camera, my retired digital cameras werent pricey but cost the same as this phone. The pictures this phone takes download on to a sony memory stick or in the phones memory.  It can store more pictures or film then I could ever max out, the zoom and quality of picture surpassed my other cameras.    I will keep this phone until it is officially a antique.  I mourn if its lost or broken, I really have nothing bad to pass along."	1
If the seller can't respond to an offer no matter how the bid effects the seller emotionally then the seller shouldn't be selling goods and return to just being a consumer.	0
"If you are a ninja on the keyboard and still can't handle virtual keyboards, this is for you.  Far and away the best of all Blackberry keyboards.  The silver edition is even better than the first version."	1
"If you are looking for a small and simple phone with basic features ... this is it.  Purchased the pre-paid service with Verizon and swapped phones to our regular account--- was cheaper than renewing contract with Verizon!    User is quite happy... small, sleek, economical and functional      If you are not a PDA or Smartphone friendly person and want just a plain phone to answer/make calls .... this is it!      Even has camera, if needed .... another version comes with out it."	1
"If you decide to buy a V60i, and you need to use your SIM card in it, make darn sure the sell knows whether it really has a SIM card slot. Many of them have no idea, they just think caise it says AT&amp;T onit it takes a SIM."	0

"Im basically stuck with an outdated Samsung first generation dumb phone that cant be updated or used for anything remotely close to what I purchased it for. To say that I feel ripped off is putting it mildly. Oh well, you get what you pay for and in this case I got the shaft! eBay really should investigate these thieves. Just saying..."	0
I'm going  to  return  it	0

"I'm not gonna lie I was skeptical about buying an IPhone on EBay since sellers sell blacklisted ones , but I gave it a try and bought it and it works perfectly fine. Service got connected right away and the condition of the phone is very clean and like new , If you got metro pcs or T-Mobile,  buy from this seller , you can trust this seller "	1
Im not sure if i received a malfunctioned phone but it was not working properly and it overheated every time. Also it was controlling it self which i found very odd. Switched to the s4 instead from another seller. 	0

"im sorry, but this was one of the worst purchases that i have ever made concerning a used phone from ebay!        the phone would lock up on occasion because it seemed to be overwhelmed, and that would prompt me to have to turn the phone off and on to re-boot it again.           it would turn off and on by itself, cycle thru commands that i did not prompt, and on several really bad occasions dial back people when it was supposedly locked and in my pocket, or text people when locked and stored in my pocket, prompting some embarrassing explaining on my part!!           the phone was slow to respond to commands, and would get incredibly hot against my ear!  the qwerty key board had a lot to be desired, because it worked only half of the time, and when it did, would misspell words and self correct even though i went thru the settings to make all the neccessary changes on the phone!           to add insult to injury when i bought this paperweight, i was told to go thru ebay to buy my own charger- even though i paid fifty some odd dollars for it!  i have never been so happy for walmart! NOTHING short of a full refund would make me happy, but knowing thats not going to happen, this company can send me a self addressed stamped envelope with postage paid and i will be glad to send them back their phone in better condition than i found it!           i wish the next customer good luck, im not so happy!  i wish that it were not so, but thats the plain truth!"	0
I'm tried to charge that phone but its gives me an error that use original charger the charger u sent me with that it's not working even I tried different one still not working I don't know what to do	0
im very disapointed the phone never got to me. i wont make another perchase.i think the phone would have been fine if i had gotten it. but i didnt so .........	0

"In December I switched to a Samsung S8 to save money, thinking that it would be just a good as my Iphone 7Plus. BOY WAS I WRONG there is no comparison! The iphone is more user friendly and has sooo many less ads! I am so glad I have my iphone 7 back, I will never change again!!"	1
In my country this product has some problems because some times work and other no.  For  example I am in central park  San Jose CoSTA RICA AND THE PHONE WORK GREAT BUT I WALK 5 MILES AND THE PHONE ISN&apos;T WORK. IS THE SAME AREA AND THE SAME CODE	0
"In sentences, it hides the reality"	0
"in the description it said it was in ""Excellent"" condition and cosmetically it is!  but the battery would only hold a charge for about 2 hours with minimal use.  the seller could have seen this on their own had they checked the battery health in the settings.  I had to spend another $70 to go and have the battery replaced. I guess my message to the seller is, Don't call something ""Excellent"" and charger a premium for that condition when it isn't."	0
In the thing it said nothing about have a very bad battery it dies way to fast it on last like 45 minutes.	0
Incoming calls do not ring many times which is very annoying.  Adjusted to the highest volume but ring tone still not loud enough.	0
"indeed the phone is used and the screen is intact, but the carcass is very hit in multiple points around the screen, the phone was sent to me without its original charger and instead I was sent a generic charger that does not meet the specifications of the proper charge of the battery."	0
"Initially, I found that the phone was not a CDMA band type when I tried to use it with Verizon.  Verizon told me that it was incompatible with their network.  So, I switched service providers to a GSM band (T-Mobile) which seemed to work for awhile.  Now, unfortunately, I find that the phone does not work on cellular after I already closed my return option.  It works only with WiFi (my jetpack) and not with cellular, as it should, showing ""no service.""  I am very dissatisfied with the performance, after I paid almost $160.00 for a phone that was supposed to be brand new and compatible with the Verizon network.  My wife has the same Apple 5c phone, and it works find with cellular on the same network I am on, so it is not the service provider.  "	0

Is NOT an iPhone!  It's a black Motorola Droid Razr M XT907 refurbished phone.  It appears to power on and work but that's the only good thing I can say about it.  DO NOT ORDER this item and expect to get an iPhone - you will be disappointed.  Disputed the credit card charge and got my money back.  Wanted to return the item to seller (shipping at my expense) but the request for return was cancelled by them.  Very puzzling that they wouldn't even take back an item that they received zero payment for (makes me wonder).  My ebay account was hacked and because it was linked to my PayPal account the hackers used my Visa card to pay $549.99 for this item.  That was not the fault of the seller but I will leave seller feedback (almost all negative).  	0
"Is that case part of the purchase and also is the charger, headphones, SIM card slot opener in the purchase and is it in the box when delivered "	0
IS THIS item FOR REAL ??    500 $     some dude said he didn&apos;t receive it     EBAY IS IT A SCAM ??    IS this real folks ???    Ebay kindly look on this matter      500 $ For 128gb is this real ???	0
"Issues with phone. When received after charging and updating I realized the audio recorder didn't work. This meant no Cortana, speaker phone or recording and any other app that needs voice commands. I made vendor aware of problem. He let me know he would investigate and get back with me. He then said I needed a firmware update. Not the case. When I made him aware of this I didn't get a response. PayPal did contact vendor and advised me I could return item and get refund. I chose to keep phone because of the time already invested to personalize. I realize some may say the vendor did offer a refund but not until PayPal got involved. I'm still looking for a firmware update. Microsoft now owns Nokia Lumia phones and now sales a Microsoft Lumia line of phones. No updates for Nokia Lumia 1020 windows 8.1. I'm not satisfied with my outcome "	0

"It fits nice in a shirt-pocket and is easily retrievable as it doesn&apos;t  fall sideways into the bottom of the pocket like flip phones, and then one must struggle to retrieve them, right them, and then flip open in order to answer.  It just goes straight to work making and taking calls and an occasional voice mail.  I don&apos;t have to carry around the extra weight of an mp3, camera, bluetooth, mini-computer etc; it does not try to be any thing, but an efficient and dependable cell-phone.  Love it--love it!!!  Proof of the beautiful and the just simple-go-to-work philosophy of the Sanyo SCP 6400 is emphasised by the fact there are only 25 pages in the english section of the owners manual needed to teach you everything about using it.  It does tend to take too many calls some days tho!  I am so impressed with it that I gave a 2 month old Moto-Krazr to my daughter and bought a used one off e-bay to replace my first #6400 that had gone to cell-phone heaven.  And I paid $5 more used than for my first one, brand-new. Gladly!! No color screen or menu of extra toys to flash to friends &amp; neightbors; just a dependable work-horse that is slim, light and stays out of my way til I need it,"	1
It had fallen apart in the box the day i received it and tried to use it broken then the time ran out to send it back	0
It has a short battery life and it does freeze a lot. silent button on the side does not work properly. a small dent in the lower corner of the frame.  screen and the back of the phone are clean.	0
It has great feautures but its cheaply made. Feels like a disposable phone. Use it for a few months and throw it away. Battery is horible if you text alot or use your IM. Key pads is crowded.	0
It has really long battery life comparing to iPhones. The camera is also one of the best and you wont regret it.	1
It is 100% same as described. Everything working well. I like it very much.  	1
It is a demo phone labeled not for sell and can not be activated	0
"It is a good phone at that price and 16 GB, in comparison to ZTE maven 2 i.e"	1
It is a good value for the price.	1
It is a great phone it is almost new but there is a separation of the screen and a metal on the right lower side but other than that the phone so far works great but I just got it on the 3rd so we'll see.....	1
It is a large phone and very outdated.  It worked fine but there have been so many advances since this phone first came out.  I would not recommend it to anyone who carries it in their pocket.  It is pretty big.	0
It is a rat that steals money and does not deliver anything	0
"It is a sleek looking phone with great battery life. The phones interface is supposed to be copied from the google &quot;android&quot; interface. The phone is very slow, and the on-screen keyboard is so small you can&apos;t use it without a stylus pen.   It is a difficult, and at times, confusing phone.  I chose to get it because i looked efficient, and durable. The manual that came with the phone was for the actual Google phone, and was of no help with the Xinrong phone.  It seems more like it would be used for a palm pilot than a cell phone. Overall I was disappointed in it."	0
it is a very good phone the best a ever had	1
"it is all that i want for a phone, i feel very confortable with all the features that this phone have,  thanks so much for the service, very fast and good communications"	1
It is an excellent phone company: good prices and excellent customer service. good teams and are very responsible when an inform if you have problems with the equipment I buy. I highly recommend them.	1
"It is better than any smartphone because you don't have to run with a charger. If Samsung will decide to make it available for different carriers I believe they can make a lot of selling. The worst thing is the memory, but you can live with that. "	1
"it is everything i expected and more, i should have had one long ago, delivery was also great"	1
"It is fast, beautiful and has a magnitude of storage. The camera is extraordinary and long battery life is a definite plus! "	1
"It is hard to work with. It does not come with a hand book explaining any features , you have to learn by trial and error. Texting is complex with many steps. And the phone takes cloudy  pictures."	0
"It is just as good as phones double it's price, that have a more common/popular brand name. I'm happy with it. However its not a phone for clumsy people unless you get a case and screen protector quickly."	1
it is no good to me without a sim card you cannot activate it and the one from your does not just slide in and you are good to go	0
It is not reliable since I paid and still has sent the product I want my refund	0
it is not what is in the description the public seller that was unlocked and was not dead in a few words is a scammer who does not want to answer	0
It is posible I end up with a defective and on top of that the seller never responded.   Phone overheat Micro SD gets unmounted automatically Phone's Screen goes off as soon as it begin dialing and and do not turn on while facing. ---- Very bad signal strength--- It just does not work indoors. Battery live very poor.  I looked on line and some of the problems I have are consider popular problem for this phone. I wish I could write a better review but this is my sperience. I am alredy saving to buy a LG... my budget is too tied to go for another defective Samsung.	0
"It is simple wonderful phone, I just love it.  It has wonderful technologies that work perfect.  Compare to other phone this phone is more reliable, I have better result with it thatn other brands."	1
It is the Best Phone that $200.- can buy.  It is way better than the moto g.   It is a lot of fun and productivity.	1

It overheated and destroyed nonreplacable photos. Terrible phone	0
"It said,new, but might have handling marks? Mine was FACTORY SEALED every last piece was Brand New. I couldn't have been more thrilled with what I got. Product functions 100% and looks great. I am just amazed, and yet, it's why their reviews are so high. Maybe I am used to the ""hype"" being just a little larger than life and chalking that up to how people do business nowadays, but This phone is Fantastic!"	1
"It seems like every time I buy something from you guys it NEVER works. I had bought a iPhone 6 from you guys last year,with a dead battery that was not mentioned in the description then for it to shut down and die with the new battery you guys sent within a month. Now I got this one and the camera is broke,took it to a local phone repair shop and they told us it was a software problem aka,a bad phone. I am super upset "	0
it shuts off randomly very bad physical condition	0
It takes a little getting used to coming from an android phone. But it&apos;s a solid phone that can compete with flagship phones. Cortana works way better than I could ever expect. The camera is excellent and having a dedicated camera button is a real plus. The audio for music is not great but you are going to use a headphone anyway.	1
"It took more than three days to process my payment, then told me that I wanted to send another color because of its supplier, I paid from 27, and so far I got 2 iphones, and the one who buys me only Give the answer to send me another color haha, this is a joke for a serious buyer."	0
"It was 3 days later than last day they gave for delivery.then it turned out that it was a reported stolen phone.i don't blame ebay,it was urfreestyle.dont but anything from this seller,since he sells stolen items"	0
"It was a European phone that ""Could Not"" use a USA Sim Card."	0
It was a great phone! I decided to buy it because it was the phone i wanted!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	1
"It was a nice little phone, great features and very easy to used. But with it did not work with my sim card."	1
It was a really bad experience because the touch screen doesn&apos;t work when you touch it lightly you have to  touch it very hard lots of times than it works and it goes off when your in a middle of a conversation.So I give it 1/5 at every thing.	0
"It was a very good product, with no defects on it at all. It came new in package with a new battery and the phone still had all the covering on it. I was very satisfied with the purchase, and it was a good price for how good of a phone it is."	1
"it was all a scam,it was all a scam,it was all a scam.  The seller never answered my messages and the product never arrived, should have more control with this sort of Sellers"	0
It was bought for an 8 year old boy .good starter phone water proof and shock proof. Highly recommend as a starter phone.	1
It was defective and stopped charging within 24hrs and I returned it for a refund.	0
"it was exactly as they said great phone shipped fast! id highly reccomend them :]its a great phone for messaging and the camera is the best on a phone ive seen an a long time, even better than the iphone! over all its the best simple/high tech phone out there :]"	1
"it was for a gift , so far so good , mom is happy "	1

"it was just as i expected,easy to use the price was reasonable,i needed phone but didnt want to pay full price at the store"	1
It was labeled a T mobile phone but Tmobile SIMS don't work in it. Checked the SIM and it works on other phones...	0
It was network locked to the carrier and there was nothing I could do but send it back.	0
It was not a unlocked phone. Verizon which is my carrier said it was locked and in with another carrier. 	0
It was not unlocked as it stated it was and the battery life is poor.	0
"It was only lack of my knowledge - it comes without sim card slot, locked to verizon. USA network!Highly recomend to read carefully all description before you buy any stuff! Phone is too big and uncomfortable"	0
It was received on a timely matter did run into a little problem seller corrected issue promptlyand I was very please with my sevice and item	1

Even iif he had of contacted me and said iim sorry ii sent wrong phone or he's $20 back on order but no he just iignores the people.	0
It was supposed to be unlocked. We are still trying to get it unlocked now. 	0
"it was time to upgrade but i wasnt ready, then i found out the band could have different frequencies between uk and Canada so they became baby toys"	0
It was what I expected. 	1
It wasn't unlock to all gsm network	0
"It will not work in UK, waste of money"	0
It worked fine for 2 weeks. Then it started glitching with short battery life and won't even make calls. Don't buy this from here.... we had this same  model from T-moble and never had issues but we broke it and wanted a replacement. 	0
"It worked well for a couple months then started to restart it's stupid self every thirty minutes, like clockwork. It does the impossible. It sucks and blows at the same time."	0
It works good like new	1
It works it&apos;s fully functional came with everything as was written worth the money def would buy more items in the future! Just can&apos;t describe it! Its a A+	1
It works perfectly and looks brand new .	1
It works with Kajeet for my daughter.	1
"it would not charge properly , it wold say it was 99 to 100 percent charged until you would unplkud the charger then it would say anything from 3 to 48 percent."	0
It&apos;s a good phone and I&apos;m looking for one but...  $500 plus shipping!!!  32 sold!!!  I bet something is really wrong  I bet someone is trying to cheat us!!!	0
"it&apos;s a great phone, ease to use, tons of features, fear capacity and the battery hold for hours. I love it!"	1
It&apos;s a old phone without camera. Navigating is difficult. It&apos;s bulky.   The keyboard allows easy typing.	0
"It&apos;s a very great phone, and so far its the favorite one I&apos;ve ever used. The battery life on mine isn&apos;t great, but I got it used so there were some problems to be expected. Other than the battery, this phone has been nothing but awesome!"	1
"It&apos;s beautiful. Phone is full of features. HTC Sense is best desktop for Android mobiles I ever used. Screen is huge. Camera works great. GPS is very fast. Connectivity is as usual, not great nor bad. Phone is fast enough to run any game I&apos;ve loaded."	1
"It&apos;s good, it&apos;s out of stock. I really need it for my fishing trip. It will last for years even I drop it in water couple times a day."	1
"It&apos;s my fourth one, what can I say?   Problem is, they don&apos;t do well at all in water.  Washing machines, lakes, toilets etc..."	1
It&apos;s probably best to spend the extra $20-$50 more and get a  phone that is at least running Android 4.0 IMO	0
"It&apos;s very expensive, however, I found www.ultimategadgets.co.cc and got one for free!     As you probably know, it&apos;s an expensive item for what it is...

its a great product i would recommend any one to get it. its easy to use to be a smartphone. very nice slick and eligent look.	1
"its a nice phone but there&apos;s too many things i dont like about this phone first of all it dont send pictures messages nor receives them. it all has to be done by e-mail let me tell them something most people dont have an e-mail and those who do only use it to login to MySpace and FaceBook others wont mind taking their time sending pictures to your e-mail, thats a big negative all phones should be capable of sending and receiving pics. another thing texting the letters are too close to each other you do more misspells than what you text, there&apos;s not enough settings to be able to personalize your phone to your style. i bought it for my gf neither she liked it."	0
It's a nice phone. Some glitches. Down side I have NO SIGNAL everywhere which really sucks 	0
Its a reasonable price and trust me it's worth your money if you are on a budget.	1
its a super nice phone! i loved it	1
It's a very good quality 5 star cell phone the camera system is very good quality and alot of space 64 GB. and also sounds system is  Loud 	1
It's an amazing phone...best I've ever had 	1
"Its been a good phone, good batt life great display and faster speed than previous lg android. Only thing not as good is the qwerty keyboard."	1
"its chipped at the top right corner on the screen, i dont remember reading about that,and the crack on the back by the camera was easily fixed when i changed the back of the phone to a new back cover, great phone! love androids!!"	1
"Its easy, fun and the staff is very helpful.I would also tell all my friends and family how great your services are.."	1
It's for my son. He likes it very much. Great value. 	1
"Its great, arrived in mint condition. Nothing to complain about really, it did arrive running in the box which made me concerned that it might have suffered burn-in but it was fine. I guess it just got pressed in the box somehow."	1

"Its nice , it was a gift for my little sister and she loved it ! Awesome and smooth transaction and delivery. Came in a day or 2 early!! I will definitely buy from this buyer again! "	1
Its not a new phone 	0
"It's not the Ebay seller's fault, it's just a crappy phone. No signal, drops calls. If shopping for a new cell phone, choose a different one."	0
It's not working well 	0
It's perfect for my needs.	1
"It's really fast, and am loving it. "	1
Its small but the screen is great. I wish I could program the thumb print to read multiple fingers. But overall great value. 	1
its terrible because it could not be actiated	0
It's to small sucks is not unlocked	0
"It's very good. The only things I don't like so far is that I can't figure out a way to set it that the screen turns off after a set time. The only thing I'm able to do is under the security menu there's an option to lock when pressing the end button.   Another problem is that the keypad locks. And when you unlock it, it pops up with a confirmation message which takes a second to go away. But it's still very annoying."	1
Its well known the original galaxy mainly the S model as well as the blaze had wolfson dacs very sound quality...paired with voodoo is incredible and for the price better then mp3 players at higher cost	1
I've actually did not receive this product. 	0
I've been fooled with this purchase since this phone is blocked by UNIVISION asking me for the key and the Apple ID created by this account. I want my money back on the page where the sale was posted it says it was clean as new I feel ripped off	0
I've been wanting this phone for a while now and I'm satisfied with it. It's great and totally worth the money!	1
I've had bad luck. The speaker is broke on this phone so I just bought a new one. Didn't want to go through the Hassel of returning this. The last phone I ordered from someone else it wouldn't even turn on and I am still trying to get my refund. Which has been over 2 months. 	0
"Ive had this phone a week and as of yesterday 7/5/17. It had a full charge, screen flashed a couple times and screen went blank. I tried charging but doesnt work."	0
"I've learned to read up about a product before purchasing and that's what I did, here.  I had a Motorola 376g that is going to be phased out of service and I needed an upgrade, and this has fit the bill rather nicely.  It has features the Motorola didn't have, sound is clearer and not so broken up as it was on the Motorola.  The Motorola was on the 2G service, tho, so I'm not faulting the hardware at all.  I'll miss the ol' Motorola, but thanks to this unit, I won't miss it much!!"	1
"I've owned this device for over a year now and love it. The battery life varies by user, however, I'm a moderate user (check emails, facebook, call & text throughout the day), battery levels usually take me through 10pm on a typical day - not bad at all considering my iPhone 6 is dead by 5pm.   Plus, if you put your phone in battery saving mode, the phone easily lasts you a full day +. I would recommend. Phone is fast, doesn't lack when playing games.   I love the Turbo Charger, I get 60% with just 15 minutes... pretty cool... will never go back to apple."	1
j ai achet ce tlphone pour mon pouse car elle voulait un tlphone gold pratique a l usage et pas trs imposant et j ai trouv cette appareil conforme a son attente voila !!!!!	1

Just as described. Quick delivery. Works perfectly!  Excellent seller! A+++++++.  I would most definaty purchase again from this person.	1
Just awesome and if you see a bad review it means the buyer was a a** since the seller is amazing	1
"Just got the LG vu CU920 in yesterday; had no problems swithching sim over, functions very well, met expectations. Easy to figure out and use. Very pleased with the product and product description that was given.  Would recommend to anyone looking for an easy to use touch screen. Transaction was smooth and prompt, received product in a reasonable amount of time, as was specified, 3-5 days after purchase"	1
"Just like it was described, great used cell phone! Fast shipping, will do business again! Thank you!"	1
Just picked up my new phone at the post office. Opened the box it's 10 of 10 or 100% perfect. O couldn't be happier so far.  	1
Just setup pre-paid service and phone seems to be functioning fine. Have not used it enough to test battery life. Will update as phone gets more use. 	1
Just tried to activate this phone and cell store said it was DOA and still tied to another account. WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO PULL?!	0
"Just what I have been looking for. My husband is 40% blind and has arthritis so the touch screens are out. He likes the flip phones with buttons and I like getting on the internet, so it is the best of both worlds for us that is sold in the USA. I had been looking at something out of country until I found this phone."	1
"Just what i was i was looking for, at a great price! i checked everywhere i could think and found this phone just in time."	1
Just what we ordered. Thank You	1
"Kann leider keinen Testbericht schreiben, weil ich den artikel nicht erhalten habe, obwohl ich ihn ber paypal bezahlt habe!!!!!"	0
Kept closing apps. I ended up returning it. 	0
"kind of ridiculous if you ask me. the android has over 65% of the apps apple has, FOR FREE. had nothing but issues with this phone. iphone is kind of lame EXPENSIVE way to waste money. if i were you, i&apos;d invest in the android market where you DONT HAVE TO BE IN WIFI to use the camera. who honestly would use that? get the evo i pay 80 bucks a month for unlimited EVERYTHING. at and t users pay 45 bucks ALONE for the internet. common. get real. you&apos;re wasting money. android is better."	0
Kyocera Laylo M1400 (Metro PCS)was as discribed works great my little girl loves it. Great and fast service would buy from you again.	1

La verdad el celular llego ms roto de lo que esperaba	0
Lamentablemente la bandeja del chip estaba rota lo dems la placa estaba liberada y funcionaba bien	0
Large screen. Removable battery. Headphone jack. Just enough RAM. Fairly fast for web stuff (not games). Expandable storage. Now have to find another grade A one at this price ($70) that's GSM unlocked.	1
"Lastly, my gripe against Verizon. I couldn&apos;t go without making the point that Verizon made this &quot;latest and greatest&quot; phone available for preorder for NEW customers before allowing customers such as I, who&apos;ve been loyal to Verizon for nearly 10 years. Maybe I&apos;m just used to professional companies such as Apple, Sony, and LG taking care of &apos;their own&apos;."	1
"Le di 3 horas de carga, pero segua sin encender."	0
Le vendeur a annul l&apos;encher car il ne voulu pas livr l&apos;objet pour la france  c&apos;etait un peut malhonnete de sa part parce que c&apos;etait pas preciser dans son annonce.Je pense de ma part qu&apos;il n&apos;est pas trop fiable.	0

"LG G2 verry good phone excellent I buy this phone for me ,I compare to my phone HTC this phone is fast"	1
LG Lotus is a good phone.  It&apos;s a flip phone that has a QWERTY keyboard.  Much thinner than most phones with similar keyboards that have the slide out function.  Large LCD screen for easy reading the good feel with buttons that don&apos;t mesh together while inputing or texting.	1
LG V20 phone arrived quickly and was exactly as described. Communication was immediate & correct. An Excellent overall buying experience. 	1
Lies and says I posted no returns.  Should have said no refunds even though I lied about what was wrong with the phone.  Had to get eBay involved to get my money back. 	0
"Like a brand new phone! Functions perfectly, unblemished in appearance. I couldn't be more pleased. "	1
Like new condition Great value	1
"LIKE REMEMBER FEATURE. TEXT SEND DOES NOT FUNCTION. PRICE WAS LOW, BUT AWARE CDM MODELS WILL SOON BE OBSOLETE. TOOK FOREVER TO RECEIVE, HAD TO COMPLAIN TO SENDER. EXCELLENT EXTERNAL CONDITION."	0
"Like the size, weight, screen is beautiful, camera rocks! Android 2.2 and future upgrade to 2.3 is fantastic!    Don&apos;t like the fact that unless phone is rooted, one must actually keep the standard programs installed and can&apos;t remove them.  I HATE FACEBOOK!"	1
"Like:Sleek Stylish Phone, Wide Range Of Color Selection.  Love:Crystal Clear Loudspeaker, Great Ring Tones.  Reason:Purchased Motorola W490 2 yrs ago, Just had all Features Required for business."	1
"Liking this new phone - did have a few scratches on it, but didn't buy the A grade so okay."	1
"Listing stated device is seller refurbished, but phone came with tons of scratches, dirt caked in the back cover by the camera and by the volume buttons, a crack in the plastic by the call end button, and plastic missing by the volume button. Device didnt seem very refurbished unless your idea of refurbishing is shipping a heavily used phone and putting plastic over the screen that is heavily scuffed/scratched."	0

Love everything about this phone! Worth every penny!	1
Love it from time i put my hands on it	1
"Love it! Bigger than my last phone (a bit of a down for me, but great for others, I know), but it has a dual SIM, a SD card expansion, a forever battery life - all very important for me. The speakers aren't as loud as I hoped, but very functional. I'll be staying with this one for a while!"	1
"Love it, fast shipping it's so beautiful"	1

love my phone!!! it came on time and it work perfect :) i was not sure at first but i got i was happy i would buy again	1
"Love the capabilities of the phone, but be aware that Verizon charges an extra $30 per month to upgrade to a Smartphone. Devour has all apps of Smartphones and is more sturdy than Droid. Bought it because we researched the phone and liked its abilities. Devour is sleek and easy to use."	1
Love the iPhone 4! I have been a loyal customer for the Apple products and would highly reccommend to everybody.	1
Love the phone and bonus one month plan	1

love this phone!!!!!!!!!!!!!super fast and user friendly.Had it with another company and changed to verizon and didn&apos;t truely realize how good it was till it was gone. Would pick it any day over an iPhone.	1
LOVE THIS PHONE. Disable some of the battery guzzling functions and it really makes me not regret switching from the iPhone (primary reason is the physical keyboard). 	1
Love this phone. The current price vs the performance and features makes it an excellent choice. 	1
"love this product, speedy shipping extremely happy with my purchase needed a new phone this was right up my alley"	1
"Love, love, love this phone. I do not use/want a smart as for my intents and purpose a basic flip phone is for me. I love the fact that it is wind, shock, and water proof and if I feel the need to get on the internet, I have that capability with a pay as you use deal. The one drawback, if you consider that a drawback is the camera doesnt take ""immediate"" shots. Once you clic to take the photo the camera/phone takes an additional 2 seconds to actually take the photo. I am not a photographer so no biggie. I had a Casio Gzone a while back and loved it and this phone is almost a clone of that one with better styling. Verizon wanted 49.99 for this phone plus 40.00 extra for hookup, and I would have to have agreed to a 2yr contract. I have been a loyal verizon customer for over 20 yrs and have never missed a bill and have not been on a contract for quite some time. I bought this phone that I wanted off ebay and it was less than what verizon was going to charge and no contract! No brainer. Thank you"	1
LOVED JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING ON PHONE.  THE ONLY THING I DID NOT LIKE WAS WHEN YOU SCROLLED ANYTHING YOU TOUCHED OPENED.  TRIED RESETTING TOUCH SETTING. NOTHING WORKED. BROKE PHONE IN HALF AND THREW IT OUT WHILE DRIVING. MAKES 2 LG PHONES I HAVE HAD THAT HAVE BEEN A P.O.S.	0
"Loved the product.  Wonderful experience.  Exactly what we wanted in a phone, and in great condition. Thank you so much"	1
Loving my new phone. It arrived quickly and was just as described. 	1
Luke the title said. Even worse i reached out to seller and nothing. Im a little sad.	0

man this phone is bullet proof. great phone for the money and perfect for teens. I dropped it on concret and Im 6-9 and it didnt do anything to the phone but put a little scratch on the back side of the phone and the battery lasts for 3 days on normal use.Great value for the money	1
"Maybe it was my mistake, but I expected this to be a working phone.  I realize with the world &quot;parts&quot; in the title that may have been naive, but the phone came with a non-campatible charger and various other broken bits and bobs.  Nothing useable."	0
"Me encant este equipo por mucho es el mejor smartphone que eh tenido, la pantalla es magnfica se puede ver muy bien bajo la luz del sol, el sonido tambin es muy bueno tanto como con auriculares como por las bocinas del equipo.

"Might have been good in 2016, but now they're slower than molasses in February. Yes it has a nice clear 5.5"" screen but the 1.1ghz quad core is not sufficient at all. Battery life is dismal and in the end it's a good beginner phone but not much else. Spend your hard earned money elsewhere."	0

It took me several days to figuere how to get everything work out though because my service provider &quot;T-mobile&quot; doesn&apos;t have  that model. So, I searched the net and got it worked out.

"My experience with this phone its great, when you have already a phone with Windows Mobile, but if you have before a phone with Android, the sensation is rare because the interface in Lumia is clean, simple, and light.  Lumia 710 is very fast, excellent screen, very good on playing games, nice to watch videos, the music player is good.  This phone was designed to have internet connection all time, if do you want save files out, you must move files to Skydrive, or if you want move file to the phone, just copy files from Skydrive to phone.    Lumia 710 take nice pictures and is very easy share your moments in Facebook, because facebook connection is integrated in the system.  With applications you have thousand in the windows market place."	1

"My last phone Galaxy SII died and I don&apos;t do contracts with phone companies so I had to try to find something in my budget. After searching and reviewing multiple phones I decided on the HTC M7, would have loved to get the M8 version but was more than I wanted to spend at the time. After having this phone for a few months I have to say I love it, it doesn&apos;t have an sd slot but the 32gb is plenty of room for me and I have a lot of apps on this thing a ton of pictures and 3 full length movies and I still have about 20gb left. I did root mine when I got it, just because I don&apos;t like all the t-mobile junk that came on it. Bottom line this is an awesome phone and there is only a couple of differences between the M7 &amp; M8 but if you afford the M8 do it you will get a SD slot and a little better camera."	1

My wife has has a razor for the past 6 years and will have nothing else.  She was won over immediately.  The ease of operation. The slimness of being able to fit in her fannypac and able to last 6years with 6 children.  Only thing replaced was we changed to a extended life battery. Notheing fancy or a lota gagets.

"My wife wanted a replacement for her Samsung Galaxy 5.   She stopped enjoying the phone after one year. I bought it for her for nearly $700.00.   The first problem was the phone was starting to look beat up. It was a white plastic case with chrome colored plastic.   Cosmetically, the phone was looking worse for the wear.   The second issue was the Micro USB port was not making good contact and it was getting difficult to charge the phone.  My wife was not complaining about performance.   The phone was plenty fast.  She did complain that the phone only had 16 GB which when I bought it was twice the 8GB she had on her last phone.  I showed my wife several bargain phones that she didn't like.  Several of the phones were styled to look like iPhones.   She said if you want to get me a phone that looks like an iPhone, buy me an iPhone.  When I showed her the YotaPhone 2, she really liked the look.  I was able to buy the YotaPhone 2 for her for only $139.95.   I had seen the phone advertised as low as $119.95 but all of the places listing that price were sold out.     I was concerned about two things.  The first was the resolution of the camera.  The other was that the OS was 4.4 and some software I used would not run on 4.4.  I went ahead and ordered the phone.   I was able to upgrade "	1

"Never receive the product!! Unpleasant buying experience! Called and checked with the seller couple times since I never receive the product; first time the seller said that products lost during delivery process, second time still havent receive the product. The seller told me to contact the UPS, when I called the UPS, it directed me back to the seller. This is absurd! The sellers not being helpful at all, not only he is not helping me to find out about what happened to the delivery of the product, but also being very rude by saying hes not going to help me , he said just dispute the charge, dont bother. What kind of attitude is this? I dont care about the money, couple of dollars, no big deal, but this attitude from the sellers very disturbing. This is not the way to do business and this is not how a seller should treat his customers. This is UNACCEPTABLE! I did get the refund, lucky me. "	0

"Never received the phone despite what seller times2sell said. times2sell sent it to the wrong address. when I e-mailed times2sell, I got the response that it was delivered at Skypost, telling me it's the parent company of Puntomio. Puntomio is the company I use to receive my packages. Puntomio never received the package. Puntomio contacted Skypost. Skypost never received the phone and the statement about R. Garcia signing for it is also false(see attachments). When I tried to get a refund of my money, you(ebay) denied it in less than an hour. So I'm putting the one star because 1) I did not receive the phone.  2) you(Ebay) missed the mark on this one.  I attached 3 pictures (response times2sell, response Puntomio and the usps tracking).  Check them for yourselves and also check my shipping address and the address for Skypost (FL 33126). My shipping address is for this phone is: 7701 NW 15th St Account # CW228996 Miami FL 33106-0001 United States."	0

Never recieved the BlackBerry and will be seeking a full refund! Absolutely HORRIBLE online shopping experience and this was my first purchase through Ebay!

New Blackberry Storm is faster and more reliable than the original version. ONLY issue is with very small print on the drop down menus.  Need small fingers to hit correct item.	1
"New may have been a good phone. But i bought it used and when i bought a sim card and turned it on the screen was flipping irradically. And it was as if i were touching the screen w/o me touching it. It even went into the settings and changed a setting...i never touched the screen when it did that. I did turn it off and turn it back in and it didnt do that anymore. It also, closer to the edge of the screen, when i tried to text i pressed &quot;a&quot; and it would never read that i pressed anything.So i was able to get a refund."	0

no where on listing did it specify that the phone had water damage or that it needed any sort of sim card to get it connected. when we got the phone on the back of it with a permanent marker in black letters it said &quot;liquid damage&quot; and we couldn&apos;t get it connected to boost mobil due to the fact that it needed a sim card which we where completely unaware of since  our previous boost mobile phone didn&apos;t use one.so overall we are very disatisfied and money short and left with a phone we cannot use :[	0

"Not as easy to use as my old Motorola, but All-in-All, a pretty good phone.  I don&apos;t need all the fancy stuff, and since I unlocked mine (Call AT&amp;T and give them the IMEA number - they will give you the unlock code so you can do it while you talk...), I can use local SIM cards everywhere I go - Europe, Africa, USA, South America....  I DO miss the voice dial from my Motorola on Blue Tooth, but this one does not do voice dial at all...    Voice transmission is good with both hand-held unit mic and Jawbone Bluetooth.  Audible reception is also good, so communication is good with this phone.    It does have a browser and capabilities that I never used, so if you don&apos;t mind having a &quot;prehistoric phone&quot; (we volunteer at the local High School and are constantly amazed by the kids that have much more impressive phones than we do), it will work well for you.  I don&apos;t care about that stuff, so Mehh?!    I got a few extra phones  at a good price, so I keep one with SIM cards for everywhere I go, and save the local numbers on each one as needed.    I like it, but I guess I am pretty much Old School."	1

"Not having owned any other &quot;smart&quot; (or at least not developmentally disabled) phones, I have to make the disclaimer that I&apos;m not the most well-informed bloke on this matter. I&apos;ve been told this phone is the gateway drug to the iPhone, and I have to say I do look forward to having one of those, since I&apos;m yoked to AT&amp;T for approximately forever and the Droid thus escapes my reach.    As for the LG I do like the full touch-screen keyboard and the multiplicity of punctuation marks &amp; other symbols. As an actual telephone, it seems to work okay.  Who can tell if the dropped calls are more the phone&apos;s or the network&apos;s fault?  I didn&apos;t opt for a data plan (saving as I am my virginity for the above-mentioned iPhone), but that doesn&apos;t keep the phone from being all bored just sitting in the dark in my pants pocket and spontaneously taking me online and running up extra charges. I could just lock out the &quot;data&quot; option, but then you see I wouldn&apos;t be able to send or receive photos with my texts.  Who can live like that?   A tech support guy took me through the 3-step process to lock the phone to avoid spontaneous online forays and sudden trips to the TV shows that I could if I wanted to shell out more for.  But three steps?  Really?  Don&apos;t they know who they&apos;re dealing with?    But there&apos;s something else you should know.  I bought me a Pioneer car stereo from my LOCAL INDEPENDENT dealer--NOT a corporate big box place, thank you very much.  I opted for hands-free Bluetooth so I could comply with Cal. state law when I talk on my LG phone.  It worked okay for a short spell, then intermittently, and finally not at all.  So I went back to see the car stereo guy Al--HIM I would recommend, no sweat.  And he spent an HOUR-AND-A-HALF trying to sync up the LG to the Bluetooth--no dice.  He talked to the secret tech support guy for dealers from Bluetooth--you know, kind of like when a doctor talks to the radiologist. And you know what he found out?  That the LG can&apos;t really support Bluetooth on the Pioneer car stereo!  Which means I paid a bunch extra for Bluetooth capacity on the stereo and I can&apos;t use it!  Thanks a lot, LG"	0
"Not made for the US market; made for some Muslim country.  Phone has imbedded settings for prayer times in some 20 Muslim cities, it shows the direction of Mecca, and it does not have the standard languages such as German, Italian, Chinese and Portuguese. I have still to verify if it has all 4 wavelengths are advertised.   It does support English and French languages.   Supplier did clients a great disfavor by not listing the above features so that they can decide by themselves whether they wish to be burdened forever with the undesired features. Since I left for Brazil soon after the phone was delivered, I could not return it.   For this lack of information, I would rate the seller a 2."	0

"Note 9 is one of the best Android devices found even still at middle 2019. S10's are on the go and we are expecting the glorious Note 10, but, for the moment, this 6''plus screen is one of the best devices you can get.  As everything from a predefined device, has some flaws, like the curved screen having some light bouncing to the very edge of the screen glass at peak luminance, and the fact that is an all-glass sandwich, wich requires some care on choosing screen protectors, and a hard case.   Besides all of that, the phone is a generous monster machine, at base specs of 128gb internal storage with extra Memory slot, 6gb of RAM, the super calibrated AMOLED screen, the famous S-Pen with now Bluetooth capabilities and color signature, a whooping 4k mhz battery and fast charging that works with 15W adapters, charging the phone from 0% to 100% in less than 2 hours.   Its a great all round device, and I'm expecting it to last some good years. "	1
nothing buy phantom screen issues. i should have done my research first. purchased this for my spouse as an upgrade to her iphone 4 which was rock solid for years. the iphone 6s did not last a week. Apple products are not what they used to be. i switched to Android two years ago. much better operating system and hardware manufacturers. never again. 	0
Nothing to say about a product I can't use	0
"Numerous faults with the S6.  Gets very hot very quickly.  Battery life poor (can't switch batteries on this model), fiddly little micro sim.  Purchased as present, but wouldn't use one myself."	0
Nunca pens que tendra mi telfono antes del tiempo de entrega gracias por ser tan rpidos en sus envos y tan responsables 100% recomendados....	1
Obsolete and cannot be activated on Verizon network.	0
"Ojo,. el vendedor es un tanto raro. Ha publicado el anuncio en dos ocasiones. En la primera yo puj por ese telfono y, casualmente, cinco minutos del final de la puja, apareci un nuevo sujeto interesado y la perd. Bien, puede pasar. Pero ahora ebay me manda un correo y veo que el telfono se vende nuevo. Pero, no haba un ganador en la puja? Actuaciones extraas de este vendedor. Yo ya no me fo y por si acaso aviso a alguien  que quiera comprarlo. Ojo!"	0
Ok real basic. It was brand new. I don&apos;t use it much so it is ok.It is a older version and people just want a way to text and call me. So this will do until I am ready for an upgrade or switch phone servers	0
"Ok. I had this phone on Verizon for the first phone (V325i) and it was excellent. Every feature worked great. So when I got a silver version of this phone from a family member I believe it was the v323xi? But it had horrible battery for the second phone, couldn;t send or recieve pictures and almost all of the time I got a message back saying that My message had been delivered. I was so happy to switch back to my Jest phone. At first this runs great/but getting it again is a big no no. But it is a very durable phone. For that I think it deserves SOME credit"	0

"Old phone, and all that implies.  I bought a few really cheap old phones, figuring one must be good for the price.  I&apos;d go with the K9 instead if you&apos;re interested in having an old phone.  Maybe the K10 Deluxe.  I haven&apos;t tried it yet, but it seems like a nice step up."	0
Omg I got a iPhone 7 plus today it's so good and very much fast plus has very fast service	1
On Google the Galaxy Nexus is sold for $349:  https://play.google.com/store/devices/details?id=galaxy_nexus_hspa	0
"On the plus side, priced right. fast shipping, nice size, good factory response to warranty.  On the downside, it is very difficult to operate,  Regardless, to what is stated in their write-up there are NO instructions only trial and error on your part until you get frustrated.  I wish it was otherwise. "	0
"On you questions above, I don't know if it has a long battery life, as I haven't move my service over yet, and I don't know what a small form factor is, but I ordered this phone, used, and it looks brand new!  Not only that, it said it was to arrive the 27th, and it arrived on the 24th.  :)  I can't wait to move my service over and see if it works as good as the service has been.  Thanks again!"	1
"One of My favorite mobile,perfekt size, the bad thing is ,no more updates ,and very little apps  to find beacuse ovistore no more exict "	1
One of the best phone out there and this is a deal you can refuse!!! Everything is new like i was told by Monster809...	1
one of the best seller on ebay... thank you.	1
One of the top rated cell phones by Consumer Reports.  Good screen size and not to big to still fit in pocket with lifeproof case. Other cases like otterbox will not slide in/out of pocket easily.	1
"one week after i got the phone i noticed that battery is very weak,after charging it keeps only one day(without me using  the phone )"	0
"Only a half phone, without back ,wire and plug user manual.Dont need that. Money back at once.Need a phone. Dont send me more.You hawe to take cost of transport back.I need to by phone from other place.Gear Best is a good place to shop. How can you do this.Nothing to escuse.They new this."	0
"Only issue is battery life is short . I love my phone still, all the on screen tutorials helped lots and love the camera has a flash and Panoramic view to snap pics. I love the size and its lightweight but tough enough to stand a bump and drop. I would recommend this phone to friends and family. I am totally satisfied 100% with this smartphone."	1
"Only thing I miss from my other Razors are the quick commands, other than that a nice little phone, Thanks seller!"	1

"Perfect phone, thanks to Blackberry I come through 4 different blackberry phones, but this is perfect..."	1
"Perfect size for front pocket of jeans or shirt. Fast operations and gobs of storage room for photos and downloads. Widgets through MetroPCS go very smoothly. Bright screen with easy to see icons. Charges superfast but if you are on it a lot, as I am in my line of work, have a means to charge it during the day. Maybe an extended battery might do the trick?"	1
Perfect transaction.  I asked for quick shipping and he sent it right away bc i was going out of town.	1
"perfect! The Galaxy S 4 is Samsung&apos;s flagship device for 2013. The S 4 ups the ante of its predecessor thanks to a 5&quot; 1080p Super AMOLED display (PenTile 441 ppi), a pseudo octa-core Samsung Exynos 5410 or quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 (depending on region), 2 gigs of RAM, up to 64 gigs of storage, LTE connectivity, and a 2600 mAh battery. Furthermore, the device features additional features such as floating touch and a 13 MP shooter featuring a revamped camera interface. All this brute force is encased in 7.9 mm of Samsung&apos;s well known Hyperglaze plastic finish."	1
Perfect. As ordered.  Seller responds quickly to a problem with the data cable.  Thank you! 	1

Phone works well it is a gift so would not be able to say much. But the person that received the phone is an older person that needed to see the numbers well and that it was not any trouble to maneuver. So far so good... would recommended if looking for a phone that is basic and simple to work.	1

I will be reporting this to BBB and other places if my request is not met immediately.

"Product arrived intact, working, and unblemished.  However, product arrived rattling around in the box and without documenrtation or manual of even kind.  So there was no way of knowing if the device was really new, because it was shoved in a Kyocera box that was not the original one.  NorI did I find the seller's explanation of where the phone came from, and why it was not secured in the packaging, satisfactory.  To call something ""New in Box"" implies that the device is sealed in its original packaging, which us untrue.  "	0

"Product not as described -- it is missing the port cover and they sent me the wrong charger, even though their description says ""EXACTLY AS PICTURED"" or something of the sort. It's a photo of a phone they don't send.  So 2 stars taken away, and also another because they haven't responded to my message. It doesn't cost more than a few bucks to replace these things, but an inconvenience, so poor customer service and marketing.  Phone works great otherwise."	0

The customer service was good and the replied in a timely manner, but they  were aware of the poor qaulity of their products because they even made the  mistake of telling me that people always complain about the charger not working too."	0
Product was supposed to be used only 5months and in almost new condition.speaker on phone did not work.corners of phone had good size scratches on them.Not what i expected.Sent back and got my money back.Except for the shipping and the hassle of having verizon activate then deactivate it.	0

Professional and fair conflict resolution. Fast shipping. There was a little misunderstanding in the description but the seller made it right. Would definitely buy from this seller again.	1
Prompt shipment. Thank you!	1
"Pros: Excellent, easy-to-use (intuitive) interface. Lots of free apps to download (TruPhone, Pandora, Yelp, AirSharing, PixUp and ArtGallery are faves). Fast 3G. Outlook/Exchange connectivity works well (though sometimes push is delayed). Safari is great.    Cons: 2 megapixel camera is blurry in daylight, unusable at night/low-light. No copy and paste feature (not a big problem, though)."	1
"Pros: Nice keyboard good click response, using trackball to navigate is easy, nice screen, small and can fit in any pocket, camera w/ Flash, SureType (great for fast texters!)802.11b works great and other generous little features.    Cons: Speaker and microphone could be a tad louder, battery case is fragile a case for the phone is recommended, somewhat short battery life.    Other than that, this is a great solid phone for those looking to buy an inexpensive starter business phone. With built in wi-fi, dual-band GSM, and a bunch of other neat little features this phone delivers exceptional performance for the price."	1

Purchased the J7 when updating a Galaxy S3 on Virgin Mobile.  We couldn't believe the value for this relatively inexpensive phone.  Nice size with a big screen and nice keyboard with numbers on the qwerty face.  We just changed carriers to T Mobile for a lower priced unlimited deal and bought two new J7s (but GSM vs. CDMA).  Highly recommended.	1
Purchased this for my brother who has Alzheimer's. He cannot operated newer phones because they are too complicated for him. It is excellent condition and was shippped expeditiously. I may purchase a few more as he has a tendency to lose things! Thank you!!!	1
"Purchased this phone about a week ago. A brand new one.  The phone itself is fine, but the battery won&apos;t hold a charge.  It won&apos;t even last a half day.  It&apos;s kind of funny, the person that I bought it from is no longer on here."	0
"Purchased this phone under the idea it was a new phone, since it was listed as such. Wanted a temporary upgrade from my Note 3 till the Note 8 drops. What I received was a literal joke. Immediately noticed excessive wear around the charging port upon opening the already opened box. Not that big a deal, proceeded to swap my sim card in and transfer service.   First white screen I was on I noticed the keyboard and multiple other things burned very clearly into the screen. And a small portion of the picture on the top of the screen is distorted on top of the fact it seems the antenna may be worn out a bit, as not once during the entire day I ran it did it get more then three bars in an area with excellent service. While trying to launch the ebay app to message the sellers the phone randomly reset on me. Did this about 3 or 4 more times before I managed to get the app opened. Took them a little over a day to even respond and when they did gave me a very vague response with little to no instructions on what they were going to do.  They ended up claiming it was a mistake but didnt go any further into detail.

"Received a refurbished phone supposedly in ""B+"" condition.  It freezes every time I try to access the phone from the lock screen and has restarted itself every ten minutes since I started it up.  Its just plain unusable and unsatisfactory. The only pro for this phone is that it takes great pictures, when it doesn't freeze or lock up."	0

Received Verizon phone and our Verizon Sim card wouldn't work. Worked on it for 4+ hours going back and forth with Verizon... Even tried new Sim card. Verizon concluded its not a Verizon phone and said they could still try to make it work but the battery drained so fast (from half to 0% in minutes) so we decided it's best to return it.  They have been wonderful with the return process so no problem there. Just wish it worked since it was a Christmas present. 	0
Recently I pechased 2 Blackberry Pearls. One for myself and one for my sister. My phone was a totally different situation. My sisters phone which I purchased from this seller was nothing short of perfect! My sister loves the phone. The seller gave a perfect description of this phone and the communication was just as good. They provided lightning fast shipping wich is always appreciated from the buyers end. absolutely easy phone set up from the verizon website. No problems or deffects with the phone at all. Thanks to the this seller for being a top notch Ebay seller. Would return to this sellers store again!	1
"Reception is good, way better than my old RAZR.  I&apos;m a H.S. Teacher and all my students really like the stylish looks of my new phone.   I don&apos;t text, but a few of them liked that the phone has a small keypad area so texting is faster.    The keypad has a great feel, I like the responsiveness of the buttons.  My phone came from Hong Kong apparently, the games are in some flavor of Chinese.  There are even Chinese characters on the keypad.  That&apos;s cool stuff to me.  Bluetooth works well, I sync it to my MacBook Pro using Apple&apos;s iSync software.  Contacts and Calendars sync perfectly.  Even the Contact photos sync too.  I really like this phone."	1
Recieved my Samsung Galaxy Note 9 and it was exactly as described. Awesome seller. Thank you! 	1

Refused to take the phone back or give me a refund	0
"Remember that it's used and at least in my case, the phone doesn't charge. I already ordered a replacement charging port to fix the issue. If you don't have the technical knowledge, remember to take repair cost into account before purchasing. The phone itself is amazing, Have been a loyal customer for HTC since their first One X. This unit is to replace another one M8 that died on me after 2 solid years of use."	1
"Replaced screen,  phone worked like a charm, looks brand new, activated with T Mobile   flawlessly"	1
Responded to my emails and sent product in a timely manner.  I enjoy my phone.  Good service to customer.	1

"Seller is disrespectful, ignorant and insulting!! My suggestion DO NOT PURCHASE ANYTHING from this seller because if there are any errors with the transaction you will be insulted and disrespected without mercy. My child placed a bid on an item without my authorization eBay suggests to reach out to seller in order to retract. I did and was completely disrespected and told that the bid will not be retracted.

Seller is rude and I think this item is stolen as the seller didn't give me  IMEI or anythjng so i can mke sure it is not stolen. don't recommend this seller. If you want to risk buying a black listed phone go ahead. 	0

Seller sold me 2 phones stated there TECHS looked over phone and they were in great working condition.. #1 phone had a bad battery and bad charging board. #2 phone also had a bad battery and a wonky charging board. Seller straight out lied when selling phones. Beware of these phones parts are cheap and what I paid for both phones both should have been repaired BY THERE TECHS wink wink before I purchased them. Parts are cheap cost me $100 to repair both phones and now they are great phones. Beware of the seller I purchased from.	0
Seller sold me a sm-g930p but on the ad clearly shows in the description as a sm-g930f model. But i when received the broken item i only found out when i opened the item that it was a sm-g930p model.  Now the seller is making the excuse that i had opened the broken item that. Now i cant return it when he knew he sent me the wrong model. Bad business in turn i messed up my phone. Please do not trust this seller he will post item that are not what he has in the description. And will make you out to be the bad guy i lost my phone and 50plus dollars to this low life scammer.	0
"Seller stated used, I would almost state that was a lie. it is in perfect condition. this phone has open a complete new door way into the business word.  not having it is like still stuck in the stone-age. unbelievable what it can do! life has complely evolved. thank you safe seller. Can&apos;t go wrong from buying from this seller. But be careful who you do buy from. Keith R Edwards"	1

"She should of honored her return policy. The item was not in working order!  She took over a week to get it to me, said she overlooked the email that said I had paid.

"Simply put, this is great phone. It&apos;s the perfect size and has a crystal clear speaker.  It comes with a plethora of options, as most cell phones of today do.     The features include a 1.3 megapixel camera, video recording, VCAST, MP3 player (music controls on the front), web browsing, bi-directional flip, and a QWERTY keyboard just to name a few. I love the QWERTY keyboard as I use the phone for texting more than I do for talking.    My only small complaint with the phone is the key size, they are very small and very close together. If you have large fingers then you will be fighting to press the correct keys.    The camera works great and took surprisingly clear pictures compared to my last phone.  A definite plus.    If you are a text&apos;er, and want a small phone with a full QWERTY keyboard this phone will not let you down."	1
"Since I buy and I recieve this phone,they sent to me bad one,they say it&apos;s brand new but it&apos;s not since then and now I have not refund yet this shipper no good and i don&apos;t to get refund or not."	0

"Small, reliable, no unnecessary bells and whistles. Just makes and receives calls with Bluetooth! After all, what&apos;s the purpose of having a mobile phone? If I wanted to watch television, I&apos;d but a television set. If I wanted to listen to music, I&apos;d buy a stereo. Get it?"	1

"So far I really love this phone.  The pearl takes a bit of getting used to.  I used to have a regular clam-shell non-smart phone, and this one is definitely a change.      The phone is quite light and streamlined.  It feels very nice in my hand.  The casing is very shiny and smooth.  I can see it being scratched easily, but my phone was used, and it has barely any visible wear.  I am sure it was kept in the case, which if continued, I don&apos;t see why the phone would not continue to look as fabulous as it does now.     The screen is a nice size, the buttons, although small, are easy to navigate once you get used to the typing functions.  The texting is quite different than a regular phone, but it doesn&apos;t take long to get the hang of it.  I like that the words are on a list, but that I don&apos;t really have to even pay attention to it if I&apos;m in a hurry.    The only problem with the texting and pearl are that I couldn&apos;t see someone older using them.  The keystrokes would be difficult for an older person to control, the buttons hard to see, and the pearl very difficult to navigate.  The screen is large enough for me, but navigating it for someone with older eyes and hands might be difficult.    The sounds so far have been fine, and the graphics are nice.  There are so many great features to keep organized, which I love.  I am a sucker for planners and calendars.  It&apos;s nice to have everything in one place.    I haven&apos;t set up my work email yet, but I&apos;m sure this function will work just as well as all the others.  My only complaint is that at this time I have been unable to access the internet, despite havinga  data plan.  I&apos;m not sure at this point if this is because of my service (Verizon), or the phone itself.  I hope I am able to work this one kink out.    Overall, I couldn&apos;t be happier with my new phone!"	1
So far not what was in the add  I got a att note 4 it was Samsung account locked and the other phone wouldn't turn on  had to return them did not work like add said 	0
So far so good. Battery life is good until you use it then it drops pretty fast. I ordered this one to replace a Samsung Mega that I had for 2 years and the battery in the Mega 2 is a lot smaller. As far as functionality it works great.	1
"so far the cellphone is working like it should only thing i didnt like was the outer plastic..seems cheap and looks like it can break really easily,so i got me a cover for it..other than that exellent phone.."	1
"So far, I absolutely love the iPhone 3GS with iOS5! The only downside to this device is that the phone shuts off randomly at around 30%. I think this is just a software glitch that easily be fixed. Other than that, the device is great. I love the ease of access; setting up my email was a breeze, and i loaded all my photos and music easily. This phone is a great buy!"	1
"So happy to find this product! Has minor screen burn, but what phone doesnt?! This has been amazing for my daughter. Thanks for super fast shipping!!"	1
So I bought this phone based on the add. It arrived today and it looks/feels fake. I have more phones like this one original and let me tell you there is nothing original about this particular one. I'm very disappointed in the product and the seller. 	0
"So I have had almost all the diferent kinds of major brand smartphones (apple iphone, LG, Motorolla Droid, and a few more...) I have to say... This is THE BEST phone I've had. Totally easy to customize, to root, and to program. It has every feature I could ask for. I actually switched back from my New LG G5 to the G3 because the G5 had problems with GPS location... not the G3. The ONLY thing that sucks, is the battery life. But, in exchange it has amazing display. "	1
"So I&apos;ve had this phone for about 4 to 6 months now and I wouldn&apos;t recommend it. It&apos;s easy to use, but sometimes my apps don&apos;t work. The phone restarts itself randomly a lot, and once i dropped it literally like 6 inches and all of my music was gone. It did come back eventually but it took awhile. I have poor service in areas where I should have good service. Sometimes I even lose service in those areas. The battery life is awful. I feel like all I&apos;m doing is charging the phone. When I don&apos;t have all the problems I like the phone because I prefer smartphones, but I don&apos;t need anything super high tech. So overall it&apos;s an okay phone, but I have lots of problems with it, so I wouldn&apos;t recommend it."	0
So when I went to connect the phone we noticed the phone has water damage. U did not state this in the description.  This is not normal wear and tear.  The screen has white Marks every where  	0
Sold a phone with damaged speaker and parts of phone were replaced while told otherwise!	0
Sold me a phone that was locked and didnt come with what I said to have came with	0
"Sold me phone that had water damaged. The phone kept getting extremely hot when it was charging, took it to the Genius Bar and they found the liquid sensors have been triggered meaning it had water damage. Gizmotrader or whatever claim they have a 20 point inspection which is obvious complete BS. Saw them repost the same phone after I returned it. Buyer beware!"	0
Some how order was placed against my account and had to fight to get it taken off and the phone that was in the box was busted up and in pieces as if it was ran over by an car!	0
"someone hacked or fucked up and listed these phones,nothing for sale"	0
"Sometimes it would crash when charging it with usb cable connected to laptop.  Phone got ruined after updating firmware with Kies - the update finished successfully but the phone couldn&apos;t complete booting      Edit.    I finally managed to get the to phone work after using some &apos;developer&apos; tool but it wasn&apos;t a nice experience. Otherwise, it&apos;s a nice phone in terms of features"	0
"Sony won't service this ""old"" phone. Will never buy Sony anything again. "	0
"Sorry I am not able to give a review yet as the phone will not turn on.  Therefore, I am making a claim and since this is a brand new experience, I don&apos;t know just what the results will be.  Hopefully, a positive one."	0
Sorry to say I never received this phone...it was sent to my old address and has not been forwarded to us as of yet. So I can't coment about this phone.	0
Sound does not work after 7 days of regular using. Can not be fixed after hard reset... Short battery life...	0
Speaker and mic issues! Speakers do not work but 20-30% of the time. People can not hear when I call so the mic isn't working right. Speaker phone doesn't work either. Pretty much useless phone now since I cannot make calls.	0
speaks no good language lie about everything then blames on customers bad influence 	0
sprint is removing nextel iden service. you should not plan on buying any nextel phones.when the nextel service is over i will move to pay as you go.	1
"Stay away from this. I used to sell these and I had most of them return for different issue, such as signal lost, speaker malfunctioning,stuck at Lg logo, not turning on, etc. It seems like LG has done nothing to improve their poor quality hardware. Same problem with other phones like G3,G4, Stylo 2, Tribute HD, etc."	0
"Still a high quality great ease of use phone, Beats samsungs small line of flip phones, stronger all around, stronger signals, nice texture for slip resistance, loud, easy to hear."	1

Super fast shipping! Item just as described! Perfect purchase! 	1
super good phone very very derable...easy to use and get used to LOVE IT!!!! Has great features. The batterly lasts about 2 days which is more than  a lot of phones.	1
"Super phone with unusual features such as FM radio, big 5' screen,  removable battery (2days runtime for me) and microSD slot up to 128 gigs.   The XT1609 is a Verizon prepaid phone but can be 3rd party unlocked to use with any 'Verizon MVNO' such as Tracfone, Safelink subsidized and Net10. WiFi on this phone is very sensitive more so than my Droid Maxx, Ultra or even Moto X phones. It comes with 6.0 Mello and if you do use a sd card this phone can simply add it to run apps not just store media. That's a big deal. There are a few minor shortcomings not AMOLED, Quad core but not the flagships fastest, 2 gig ram but not 3 or more as many flagships tout now. 2 years ago this could have easily been a flagship model and that's the value here. I own 2 both unlocked and on Verizon MVNO carriers instead of Verizon's more expensive $45 mo plan.   I can't say enough about this model other than if you want a ALL carrier model spend more and get a XT1607 to get Sprint, AT&t and Tmobile."	1

"Surprisingly small but its actually very practical, good and bright display, good sound as well. Generally satisfied. But I really miss extra spot for headphones and also don't like the text in every picture I take with a triple camera. Stupid!"	1
"takes a bit to get the phone down but it&apos;s amazing, i love the choice between qwerty board or smart num pad texting and media option and comparative battery life are amazing, nokia strikes another win in great signal strength. 16 gigs of expandable memory easy master reset jack for used locked phones a must buy."	1

Terrible battery life for a huge phone even though it saids 3600mah. The battery lasted till the evening even without using my data. I The camera isn't the greatest. I returned mine after 2 days. Im much happier with the samsung s5 neo.	0
"Terrible phone, same as samsung amp 2, crappy camera, waste of money"	0
Terrible seller do not buy anything from him	0
"Terrible service..  Doesn't support T-Mobile at all..  When the ""phone"" arrived,  all the language was in Chinese,  I dropped my last phone and quite literally had pieces falling off everyday,  and it kills this phones service and my last phone was $100 less "	0
"Terrible.....maybe o.k. if purchased new(idunno?). But mine was used.  Thought i was getting a like new phone as advertised, but thats what i get for thinking.  My advice, dont buy!!!Aweful..woman at the phone shop would only give me $15.00 for the piece of junk, with all kinds of goodies that went with it.  I lost BIG TIME!!! you dont have too...stay away.."	0

Thank you very much .This phone is very good i real like.I see this phone for long time.So thank you very good ebayer aaaaaaaaaaaa	1
"Thank you very very much.  Great phone.   I&amp;apos;ll remember you Steve.  Thoughts: 3G vs. 3G S     1. The battery life for both is rather similar. SLIGHT improvement in the 3G S.   2. The LCD digitizer (touchscreen) is practically the same with both editions--3G seems brighter.   3. Dimensions and case sizes are nearly identical--3G S is a bit thinner. The engravings on the back are different, but you&amp;apos;re getting the same pretty case from the 3G.   4. Unaided GPS (without AT&amp;amp;T tower assistance) is just about as weak in both models... but the 3G S sports an internal compass, allowing for amazing accuracy and directional navigation while hiking and &amp;quot;street-walking&amp;quot;. Hands down, the best new addition to the 3G S.   5. The new CPU and graphics chip combine for SIGNIFICANTLY decreased loading times when partaking in both graphically intensive gaming, and everyday activities (web browser loading). In games, this contributes to increased frame rates which are highly noticeable.   6. The internal camera has been boosted from a paltry 2mp to an adequate 3mp. It&amp;apos;s not spectacular, but it&amp;apos;s in line with current offerings. It features autofocus, which is a very nice addition. FINALLY, users have built-in video recording capability without going to extreme lengths."	1
Thank you! The phone came in quickly and is working great! Good battery life.	1
"Thank you, great seller A+++"	1
Thank you. Fast Shipping and phone works great. Phone hooked up perfectly to my plan with Sprint. Love the metal encasing around the white. Nice contrast.	1

THANKYOU THANKYOU THABKYOU EVEN BETTER THAN WHAT DESCRIPTION SAID	1
That should be a piece on the side of the phone which covers up the charging port on the phone it's broken it's not there at all I was expecting to have that piece when I ordered my phone	0
Thats a brand new product. It is the way its supposed to be. Good look. 	1
"The  product was  not  advertised  as  refurbished.  The seller   did  t  say that   it  was  repaired,  screen was  shattered  and  other  parts  repaied.  phone  turns  on and  off  intermitrantly"	0
"The 2 Samsungs Galaxy S6 we bought said they were new but they are not. If you have issues with yours take it to a At&t store they can tell if it is refurbished by the numbers on the back.    NOT A HONEST Company AT ALL.  You need to change your description of these items, because they are not new. Caused our company a lot of issue sending our techs out into the field with cell phones that we thought were new and they do not work properly like a new cell phone. "	0
The A30 from MetroPCS is an excellent phone but the pictured one is not it is a Tracfone and no good.	0
The ad for the phone says it's unlocked for Sprint but it's not. The cell shop said it's still listed as belonging to someone else and needs a code to fully unlock it 	0
"The add said that was a BRAND NEW LG VX9400 and it was not, was an used one.. I am very unhappy with this."	0
the appearance of the phone was very rough considering it was advertised to be in GREAT CONDITION.  I did recieve it pretty prompt.	0
"The article is in excellent condition and is in the same conditions as the seller described.    Fantastic is the best seller on ebay, no I have to complain of the cell"	1
The back cover will not come off. I know press down and slide foward. This product should not have left Singapore.	0
the battery arrived dying (held a charge about 8 hours when phone was idle).  The round start button works about once out of 6 presses.	0
The battery does not save. It finishes within two hours.	0
The battery has a serious issue.  Speaker doesnt work properly.   	0
The battery is lasting about 8 hours or less.  I just chalked it up to the size and GB.  How long will it last?  	1
"The battery is very bad, doesn't have long battery life!!! and it restarts itself every time:( "	0
The battery life is very short.  I would expect it to last through one day without needing a charge.  It only lasts a partial day.	0
The battery not good 	0
The battery socks....it makes the nice looking phone turn into a worthless piece of junk. Battery is the life blood of any phone....so this one is dead junk without a good battery life.	0
The beet phone for this price with good camera and it's very fast	1
The best IPhone ever!!!	1
the best phone for entertainment my opinion is the it is the best phone today and i really like it and it is verry god when you watch movies/ play games on it	1
"The best phone I've had in years. I live out by a lake in Arkansas, and this phone was certainly the best reception I've had in a long time. and one of the best cameras."	1
"The best Windows phone yet!!!  It captures the eye as well with it&apos;s sleek design and white shine.  Was disappointed in the Flash, but this time, Samsung got it right."	1
"The blackberry described as NEW but after receiving delivery of the product I found it is used one. Also found scratches on the battery. I wanted to gift this phone, but now I will only have to use this. Blackberry is in working condition."	0
The bought this product since I needed a phone. I thought it was a camera phone but it turned out not to be. It had great reception and long batttery life but  it stopped working after 3 days.	0
the buyer cancel the order after payment	0
The camera does not take hd photos & when you take the video it don't catch the sound that good	0
The camera sucks on this piece of crap and it randomly shuts off on me all the time i hate this phone as far as im concerned androids period suck !!!	0
The cell doesn't let us download nothing and it say more information and we are trying to but it but it doesn't let us but the information can u plz contact us...	0
The cell phone does not hold a charge. Either we were sold a phone with a poor battery or the phone is defective.	0
"the cell phone is not unlocked to any company as his ad said, besides that the touch screen does not work properly .. very bad"	0
"THE CELL PHONE WAS BROUGHT IN AWESOME CONDITIONS I LOVED THE WAY IT WAS WELL PACKAGED AND I REALLY LOVED THE CELL PHONE.THANK YOU.    SINCERELY,  LZ"	1
The cell phones do not working any.  Its crap. One are open on one side the other want  no start yet  the cell phones arr like trash i need to know how can i get my money back  because  they show you New cell phones and its not real .help me with that please	0
"The cellphone is regular, the signal is very low, camera is good, the battery is regular, software is stable."	0
"The cellular phone is ok, but is no the same that I have before. It doesn&apos;t have some tools like the old one I mean call forwarding, mp3, and it works in different way."	0
The charger port is no good this is a waste of money.	0
"The color is cute, and the design is cool! This camera quality is Sharp, and the display is almost like holding a diamond. this is just great and I'm loving it. Unlike the Sprint or Boostmobile ones, Japan's one is way more better! Definitely worth buying it!"	1
the condition was much better than expected	1
The curve 8520 is also good for those of you who are new to the blackberry world and want to get acquainted with all that Blackberry has to offer. It&apos;s easy to use and does not compromise any features. The curve also has a camera.	1
"The delivery was quick! The phone looks brand new, I'm very happy with the software, and the price is unbeatable. Thank you! "	1
The description of the phone did not say locked and I was unable to active it with Sprint.	0
"The description said it was ""used like new"" so if that were the case, how the heck does one explain a 3 day long, powered off recharge to 100%, and a 2 hour battery life in use after 100% charging??  This phone was not ""like new"" at all, it was cleaned up yes... but far from anything new, this phone didn't even have the factory installed screen protector on it, let alone the included features like: Case, Screen Protectors, Ear Buds, USB C to female A adapter, didn't even come with the SIM tray extracter.  Needless to say, this phone was far too over priced for the lack of battery life.  The rest of the hardware is probably fine, but i never had the chance to test that out.  I DO NOT recommend this, nor would i wish it upon anyone else.  I do apologize if this is harsh, but I sincerely hope that my review will serve to inspire proper refurbishing and testing for future products."	0
The description stated no cracks and there are 2 cracks on the screen. I am very dissatisfied with the product.	0
The device arrived super quick and the devices runs like its brand new 	1
"the device is in perfect condition, very fast shipping, they really made my first buy a great experience. i hope all sellers can be more them."	1
The device was exactly as specified and for a great price!  I did all of the inspections and it passed every one in flying colors.  Thank You so much 	1
The discription was not complete nor accurate while the sighns of wear were there there was no mention of the screen being cracked.	0

The expired dates is out and I am still don't get the phone	0
The fingerprint sensor of my galaxy s5 got me broken	0
"The first phone I received the phone, it would not charge.  It was the connection of the charger to the phone that was loose.  I believe this was obvious, and should have never been sold.  So, I returned it, costing me 3.79 postage.  They replaced it with a second phone that would not accept the US Cellular programming.  That was not obvious, so not their fault.  I retured it, and refused a preplacement. I spent another 3.79 postage returning that phone.  So, the orginal 14.50 postage they charged me, plus the 7.58 that I spent, my total was $22.08, and I still don&apos;t have a phone.  I spent all that money for nothing.  The only good news was that they let me return it without a restocking charge."	0
"the first thing i saw the phone i bought from ebay , i just want to throw away ( because the phone too old ,with nothing go with that phone even the phone charge , so too expensive for that phone ,compare with $290 i had spent for )everything on phone working , but the seller said it 3gs phone ,but the phone it 3g .but  i think i never buy everything from ebay again , because i don&apos;t have experiment (maybe),"	0
The flip open keyboard is awesome.  You have larger keys that are easier to text/type with than any other phone.  I am severely disappointed that Nokia stopped making this phone recently since I love it and am going to purchase a second one while they&apos;re still available just to have when my current one wears out.	1
"The Free iPhone Guide       To get yourself a free iPhone all you have to do is follow the 3 easy steps:     Step 1 : Sign up for a free iPhone   Sign up at the link below to get your free iPhone. We recommend this free iPhone site because it&apos;s been TRIED and TESTED to work.     http://gifts.kudosnetwork.co.uk/?ref=172 (copy and paste into browser)     You can choose other prizes like free consoles from this site too! Make sure you use a real email address. Use your real details when you sign up so that the company knows where to send your iPhone! Remember that they have been proven legitimate, so will send you your free iPhone if you do everything legitimately!     Step 2 : Try an advertiser&apos;s offer   Basically all you need to do in this step is complete one of the offers, this is where the freebie site make their money, if you complete an offer then the freebie site will recieve commission for it. So if you complete Coral which will only cost you 5 to complete, the freebie site gets 25 from Coral. The two best offers are Lovefilm Free DVD rental (rent two DVD&apos;s, keep them for about 2 days, send them back and then cancel the trial) and Coral (bet 5 on a sport). I would reccommend you do Coral as it credits in an hour and is really simple to do, Lovefilm however can become complicated and takes up to 2 weeks to credit! You can also try one of the other offers, most are gambling offers. Don&apos;t skip this step! You must complete this step to get your free iPhone!     Step 3 : Refer some friends   This part is a lot easier than it seems, especially now with free iPhone sites getting so popular. There&apos;s lots of people online who want a free iPhone too, so start referring them! You only need to get a few signups before you&apos;ll be finished. You can ask your friends or your online buddies. I already got a free PS3, Wii, and XBOX Elite without even having to ask my friends for help - there&apos;s lots of people online who want a free iPhone like you! One of the easiest ways to get a referral is to do a favour for a friend and ask them to sign up in return. That way, you both can get a free iPhone!     Basic rules   Don&apos;t break these rules! This is the only reason that you won&apos;t get your free iPhone, so make sure you follow these rules!     - One account per household - don&apos;t use a public computer to sign up!   - Use real information - this is a proven legitimate site and they will not give out your information.   - Only complete each offer once! You cannot complete the same offer again, even for different freebies.   - Don&apos;t try to cheat the system. This site has been proven legitimate, and they will catch you if you try to cheat. If you do everything legitimately, by following this guide, you will get a free iPhone!     Thats all, just follow my guide and you will have your free iPhone in no time.     Thank you."	1

"THE GOOD The inexpensive Kyocera Hydro Elite is a compact, waterproof handset with wireless charging, a decent camera, and expandable memory.  THE BOTTOM LINE Kyocera's Elite will quench Verizon users' thirst for a stylish and reasonably priced water-resistant phone -- just don't expect it to be a powerful speed demon."	1
"the goods, do not match the description. do not want to solve a problem"	0
"The handset was unlocked, that was the first requirement i was looking for.  Secondly, it was a nokia, which was what i was hoping for.  Thirdly, it had a colour screen and enough memory for all my contacts, but wasn&apos;t so complicated that it needed a catalogue of intructions to work it!    Pure Bonus was the price and the excellent condition of the phone. I am very happy, many thanks to the seller!"	1

"The HTC Desire, once rooted, has all of the pros from the Nexus One, without the cons.  The Nexus One&apos;s haphazard touchscreen issues didn&apos;t carry over, and the always-annoying capacitive-touch buttons are swapped out with hardware buttons, making my life much easier.  Gone are the days of trying to watch a video or play a game and accidentally backing out of the application with a misplaced grip.  The phone really shines with a leaked version of Gingerbread."	1
"the Htc never arrive to me and I very angry, because I pay for that and de salesperson never reply my mails"	0
"the IMEI number on this phone is for a 2G network which according to the AT&T tech support is shut down.  This product is advertised as 4G, the package says 4G, but the phone IMEI is only 2G. virtually worthless. Can't send MMS messages, pics etc.  pretty much a dumb phone with a bigger screen IF you have WIFI."	0
"The iPhone 3G is the second generation of iPhone. It was the successor to the original iPhone, and is succeeded by the iPhone 3GS. Introduced on June 9, 2008 at the WWDC 2008 at the Moscone Center, San Francisco. The 3G was very similar to its predecessor, containing the same 2 MP camera and no support for video recording, and its performance was limited by the same 128 MB eDRAM memory unit.[10] Nevertheless, the 3G featured several improvements over the original. It supported Assisted GPS, 3G data and Tri-band UMTS/HSDPA."	1
"The iPhone 4 is the ultimate upgrade to the iPhone line.    I&apos;ve owned each iPhone from day 1 of their launch dates.    (Please also read my reviews of the iPhone 1.0, 3G, &amp; 3Gs)     I&apos;ve owned a cellphone since 1992. I&apos;ve always had a &quot;top of the line phone&quot; (I&apos;ve always had AT&amp;T = formerly Cingular = formerly BellSouth Mobility)     In 17 years having cellphones, I&apos;ve had over 100 (Yes 100+) different models &amp; makes.    I&apos;ve also had a few days each with the Palm Pre and Motorola Droid - neither compare to the iPhone 4.    The screen on the new iPhone 4 (also known as the iPhone HD) has to be seen to be believed. One hing that not many people are saying about the iPhone is that the screen seems to be a part of the glass not slightly recessed behind a piece of glass.    Besides the screen that&apos;s been compared to a high end laser printer for text, the new iPhone has a new button arrangement that are easier to press and understand their functionality.    The iPhone 4 also has a new antenna that delivers almost twice the performance for cell signal, bluetooth, and wifi. The casing IS the antenna!    The wifi signal has been boosted from 802.11g to 802.11n - greatly extending the range, security, and bandwidth of the signal.    The new camera on the iPhone 4 bumps up from the 2 megapixel on the original iPhone and bumps up from the 3 megapixel on the iPhone 3Gs. (Original and 3G shared the same camera &amp; processor)    I had an original Apple Quicktake camera and it was amazing even though it was below a megapixel - when Apple discontinued cameras in 1998 I longed for the day when they would again create a camera using their expertise. With the iPhone that happened - with the iPhone 4 the perfect camera now exists! A camera that can instantly share a picture or video on the internet, thru email, or save for later. A camera that has ON device editing - even through Photoshop using the Adobe Photoshop app.    The iPhone 4 also adds a front facing camera which allows you to video conference with other iPhone 4 users.    The iPhone 4 also brings a new operating system (to all iPhones) and multiple application use (multitasking) to the 3GS and iPad, and iPhone 4.    The iPhone 4 uses GSM - an international standard technology for cellphones.     Verizon &amp; Sprint use CDMA (&amp; variants) - this technology is found in very few places widespread outside the USA &amp; Europe.    While the iPhone 4 also has better GPS functionality - the Google maps app is decent but not the best - but the best app for GPS certainly got better with the better antenna and the new accelerometer/gyroscope in the iPhone 4 - try Navigon - it ROCKS!    Because an iPhone uses standard iPod sync &amp; charge cables, accessories are easy to find.     Battery life is very good &amp; improved from the previous generations of iPhones; even when utilizing power draining features like Wifi &amp; Bluetooth.     I can actually use the calculator on an iPhone, unlike on other cell phones where you have to figure out corresponding keys.    I have a lot of music nearly 2000 songs and a GPS app that takes up almost a gigabyte, plus nearly 1000 pictures on my iPhone and the 16GB model is perfect for me - leaving me with 4 gigs of space left.    Get this &quot;unlocked&quot; version if you need your phone on a different network other than a network like AT&amp;T in the US that is subsidizing your phone purchase.    I now have zero complaints about the iPhone 4. My complaints are relegated to AT&amp;T!"	1
"The iPhone 5s was great ,my daughter loved it ."	1
"The IPhone 7, Verizon unlocked phone came, not in the box as represented, but rather, wrapped in packaging instead.  The phone was not unlocked but locked.  Bad, Bad. It is un-useable to me. "	0
"The iPhone I got works great, just a few small scratches on the sides is all"	1
"The iphone is in perfect shape, it works great, the shipping was fast, no problems to report!"	1
"The iPhone itself was in excellent condition.However,the phone is still activated under someone else&apos;s name.Its clear to me that I may have a stolen product.Very unprofessional from the sellers.Very dissapointed."	0
The iPhone took a week to ship & then when it arrived it was locked by an iCloud user. 	0
The ist phone(the original i purchased) did not work.  the phone had a broken button and deleted phone numbers from my contact list.  the second phone can not keep a charge.  i have replaced the battery twice by purchasing new batteries.  The phone continues to not hold a charge.  must be a short in the phone. in other words i am disappointed in the product.	0
The item came right on time. No complaints. It was a gift and they loved it. 	1
The item doesn&apos;t work..end of story    waste of time and money    there should be no return rule - if the goods don&apos;t work there should be a refund  proceedure    makes me less inclined to use ebay when situations arise like this	0
The item has to be returned because the phone only turn on once after been charged for 6 hours and never turned on.	0
"The item I received was a fake one, not the original."	0
"The item is locked to Japan SoftBank and it is still locked. I can not use it at all, I cannot unlock it. The seller wrote that it can be unlock, but it is not. eBay is not honest with this case they decided not to refund me . So I do not have iPhone to use neither my money. Be careful with e bay and the seller.  I do not like e bay nowadays .  :("	0
"The item itself looks authentic. Until you try it for around 2/3 days. Going to be completely honest: the battery drains really fast, the plastic back cover of the phone started to crack sideways and the G4 logo gets very easily scratched and almost completely disappeared after 3 days which would never happen with the original phone, I am very careful with my device so this shouldn't even happen. The screen is also doubtful, it's supposed to be a Quad HD 1440p screen, although when I load a 2k video on YouTube, the maximum quality it displays it's 1080p which is FULL HD and an inferior quality. I really like a good deal and if it wasn't for this I would be super happy with the purchase as even the seller seems to be kind but didn't really got me a solution for this other than me sending it back to china and having to pay for shipment. I'm sorry but I can't really recommend to anyone to buy this item because to me, as of now it doesn't seem to be an authentic/original device. Apart from this the perfomance seems okay unless you run a heavy game and the seller offered a free tempered glass screen protector which was nice. Edit: the phone also overheats a lot just by playing 5min and can't really run medium to heavy games. As time goes on i get more and more disappointed with it..."	0
The item received was not the item ordered.  This would NOT work with my Verizon account as it was for prepaid service only.  Total loss of $61.00 and I donated the phone to a battered woman&apos;s shelter.	0
The item was an excellent bargain and there were no problems with shipping or with the item upon receipt.  Great buying experience.	1
The item was exactly as described. It was shipped fast and works perfectly! I&apos;m really happy to do business with sellers of this quality. Thank you.	1
"the item was listed as NEW but it was not it was heavy used,with lots of scratches and barely working buttons...  the seller charged me 35$ for shipping ,but he only paid around 6$ for shipping...  and the most important the earphone speaker on the phone its not working...    so this was my first purchase on ebay and its gona be last because I lose 200$ for nothing   My rating for this seller will be BELOW POOR   PS&gt; I was waiting 15 days to recive the phone ...such a shame to the seller  please make sure this seller don&apos;t sell anymore on ebay.....THANKS"	0
The item was perfect and it worked and looked just as described. Also the delivery was fast.  Thanks Seller	1
"The item was sold as NEW UNOPEND OR USED, it arrived in a used box, All items in the box was not rapped or in their bag like new and the phone has a defect when pressing the navigate key it shut off.  Very disappoint from the seller that was marked as top seller."	0
The K1 has lots of extras to make it an all-in-one.  The ability to add a mini SD card allows more versatility.  Good size and presentation of information but screen is a little small and cramps some info.  Good camera.	1
The keypad is clear and big enough that you don&apos;t hit 2 keys at one time. It is user friendly and beautiful.  I had one before just like it and so I bought another one as a present to a friend.	1
"The LG Chocolate TG800 from Rogers who is offered at a very high price as regards the functions. The Chocolate one dissociates majority of the devices by these keys which are tactile on the front of the device.  It has a camera of 1.3 mega pixel, which will enable you to take photographs of a certain quality. It has a screen of 176x220.  It does not have any touch screen which would facilitate navigation in the menu. No connection WIFI is present."	1
The lg mytouch is a nice looking phone just not for me its a little on the slower side but other then that a very nice looking phone.	1
The LG V20 is a good flagship killer released by LG. It's camera has good manual control like a dslr camera. It also has quad dac for sound processing and audio on this phone is something. Battery can also be replaced easily. This feature is great for long haul flights and working in remote areas with limited access to power. And don't forget it has a crisp call quality. Overall a very good phone 	1
"The Logic Board was in good condition, but it is a locked T-Mobile board. The board was returned and a refund was received promptly."	0
"The main reason for purchasing this product was because my dad needed a new phone. It was not one of the very latest however it had the necessary and &quot;bonus&quot; features; speakerpone, a mini lcd (that shows who&apos;s calling w/o  picking up the phone) web&amp; smart texting capabilities... I alsolike this phone because of its sleek look and variety of colors."	1
The microphone doesn't work	0
The mobile was locked i saind it back and i did not get refund as they promised 35 days to get it and until to communicate 10 more days passed so ebay&apos;s insuranse did not excisted they are gangsters!!!!!	0
"The MOTO G6 is the highest rated cell phone under $300 so getting it for under $140 was a terrific deal.  Happy with the phone so far, battery life is (for me) about 3 days but admittedly I am a light user.  So if you're cost conscious but still looking for a well made good function phone, I recommend you take a look at the MOTO G6."	1
"The Motorola hint QA30 is a very easy to use phone. The camera takes very good quality photos. Speaker phone, qwerty key pad work awesome. I would recommend this phone to anyone!"	1
"The Mytouch 4G is a great phone! It has amazing picture quality, fast, easy to use and has excellent features. I would encourage anyone looking for a great Tmobile phone to consider this one. They are expensive since still fairly new but I lucked out and got this one for $320 witch is a steal!!"	1
"The NewPhone&apos;s size is perfect for carrying in a pocket and the battery has a pretty good lifespan of roughly 4 hours. Overall, I&apos;d recommend the phone if you&apos;re on a budget."	1
The Nokia 3300 is a cheap phone. It has no features. At all. Its made just to call with. Thats it. No extra	0
"The Nokia 8890 is a great phone.  Unfortunately the used phone I bought did not work on the T-mobile network, as it was advertised."	0
"THE ONE I BOUGHT WAS POSTED NEW, RECEIVED WITH PRIOR TEXT MESSAGES AND DEFECTIVE SCREEN. MORE SO, IT HAS A BAD MICROPHONE WHERE CALLERS CANNOT HEAR ME SPEAKING."	0
"The only con I see about this phone is that, the battery can run out fast. To be honest, I believe that, in order to understand this phone, you should get an android frist. This is like the next level of an android."	1
"The only real problem with my phone is that windows won,t detect it on either of my 2 compters. The phone works great other wise and the seller was really good to deal with. If I ever need anything else I wil use him again and again!"	1
"The only thing I disliked is that there is no place for a wrist strap or even one you can hang around your neck so you don&apos;t lose it.  Other than that, I love everything about the phone so far!!!!!"	1
"the order is cancelled, cannot give any comment on that"	0
"the other phone will not pick any radio service,the first day the both worked fine.not now:( money throwed away."	0

The phone are not doing anything. He do not recognice the programs.I wil send it for return. I had bought a new iPhone from you. Can you please let know wath's goin on with this phone?	0
The phone arrived extremely quick. Super fast and excellent. Still searching for scratches and cant see any. Mint condition 	1
The phone arrived in great shape and was brand new but the seller forgot to add on the listing that it is a very old phone and does not match up with new sim cards. I am able to use the phone but not save any contact information which is a pain the butt......    I am in the process of shopping around for a new phone that will work with my sim card.	0
"The phone arrived quickly and in really good condition for a used phone.  I got it as a backup in case something happens to my current k325 phone, but it hasn&apos;t yet and I didn&apos;t want to change my phone.  So this phone seems good and worked great from my test run, I won&apos;t know until my current phone breaks."	1
The phone back side was cracked badly!! Not as described and not like the photos!! Bad seller! Very bad 	0
"The phone broke, it will not charge at all. A TOTAL WASTE OF MY MONEY!"	0
"The phone came dirty.  The screen has water damage.  The phone doesn&apos;t hold a charge.  I wish I had researched more on how to use ebay and better understood the return policies,  I did shortly after the purchase contact the seller to see what I could do.  I never heard back.  I understand I brought a used product and with that it may need to be cleaned up so that is the big problem.    IT stinks!"	0
the phone came in disrepair and battery charging problem and the program return is bad and slow hope they improve that problem to give a positive comment.  Excuse the inconveniences  regards	0
The phone came in without microphones soldered to the main PCB. As I could use the other parts the Seller and I came to an agreement to credit me back $30.00 of the purchase price. 	0
"the phone came scratched in 2 places, can&apos;t offer a gift that is scratched. could&apos;ve been upfront about the exact condition."	0
"The phone came with no charger. More importantly, it was to be gift for my developmentally challenged grandson to assist him keep in touch with family and have a way to report an emergency.  Guess what?, the 911 button on the side of the phone was missing. Basically, the phone is useless junk."	0
The phone can not send/receive text messages nor phone calls.  Sending the phone back to seller.  The phone does not work as expected so not happy with the phone.  I am contacting the seller to let them know and hopefully will be able to send the phone back and receive a refund.	0
The phone could not be charged and could not be repaired. The company was very quick to refund my money though.	0
The phone did not fit the description.  It did not hold a charge.  It said charging complete and it would have no bars.  Was not satisfied with it at all.	0
The phone did not work but the seller was able to return my money. I would do business with he again.	0
The phone did not work. The antenna or receiver circuit did not work ( no bars )	0
The phone didnt work so I sent it back.  The company was great to deal with for returning the product and getting a full refund.	0
The phone does not display good images. It is not very well functional either. When I tried to stay in contact with the seller they would not reply to my messages. It is the worst phone I have ever bought as well as the support from the seller being terrible. I do not recommend buying a phone from this seller. 	0
"The phone does not work 100%, sometimes it doesn&apos;t ring, calls drop and have to wait for all signal bars to be active. That&apos;s what I get for trying to save money."	0
"The phone does the job, but it is cheaply made and I don&apos;t expect it to hold up for long under regular use. Compared to the Motorola I had, there is no comparison. Kyocera phones also have terrible battery life, and this one is no exception. The display goes blank after a minute, and you have to turn the phone back on to check for missed calls or messages. I did not expect a lot for the money, but you can get a much better similar style phone for a few extra dollars."	0
The phone doesn't looklike the picture losted on ebay. Looks like a fake one. Looks like a toy. .	0
THE PHONE DONT TURN ON IT DONT MAKE NO NOISE ITS A DEAD PHONE I SENT IT BACK OUT TODAY THE SELLER WILL HAVE IT BACK MONDAY THE 12TH IF YOU MESSAGE ME ILL GIVE U THE TRACKING NUMBER THANKS        TERESA	0
The phone functions ok but it was obviously intended for a foreign market because the power cord came with a bulky adapter for use in American ac outlets. 	0
The phone got to me right away and is exactly like the description.	1
The phone had no scratches or dents with a full day of battery life.	1
"The phone had some pics in the phone,so it was used.It look a like new but maybe the faceplate was changed."	0
"The phone has a lot of good things, a good camera, fast performance, good battery, a light OS and so on, the seller sent me a pretty good unit just like he said mint condition looking like new I really recommend the phone and the seller."	1
The phone has an IMEI code starting with 01. If you want to use this phone for Boost Mobile it cannot be activated unless  the IMEI code is 00. I would not have purchased this phone had I known this information.	0
"The phone has lots of features but the features I wanted it for like Skype, don&apos;t work properly. I can&apos;t hear the calling party but they can hear me. The screen icons are very small and requires a stylus that was not included with my order. Also the OS is just over all slow."	0
The phone has several passwords on it and everything is blocked except my ability to make phone calls .  I sent the seller emails but he didn&apos;t reply .	0
"The phone have a good looking but it doesn&apos;t work good in Puerto Rico. Also, the TV doesn&apos;t receive reception and the battery dies fast."	0
the phone i bought didnt work .......i guess you cant count on getting anything good or trusting that ppl are going to mail you a quality product	0
The phone I bought was in excellent condition as detailed by seller. Prompt delivery and a pleasure to do business with. Great prices on this sellers other items. I will definitely recommend my family and friends to do business with this seller. In fact I just told some people at work. Thank you guys for everything. 	1
"the phone i got was not the same as the one pictured on e bay.  I couldn&apos;t get it to work so I took it down to my carrier, they couldn&apos;t either.  I went on vacation so I could not return it within 14 days.  I e mailed Sony and they never returned my e mail."	0
The phone I purchased believe to have a bad battery because my daughter charge phone and when she takes off charger it appears that she never charge at all.	0
"The phone I purchased through Ebay was ineffective -- I got no reception in my house.  I had to go outside in order to talk,  not good!!!  I returned the phone to the seller two weeks ago and so far, I have not received my refund, as I was promised."	0
"The phone I received fit the description perfectly! The phone also came in a timely manner and I would purchase from the seller again! Thank you, you made my phone shopping soooo much easier."	1
the phone i received was a stolen phone. i decided to buy it to save money. i picked the wrong seller.	0
"The phone I received will not function properly. Since the moment I got it, it turns off intermittently and I cannot restart it unless I plug it in. It does not matter what the charge level is.  The seller will not deliver what it is I payed for and is offering me a partial refund for battery replacement.   I would just like to have a functioning phone.  Not happy. "	0
the phone is a cool phone but this one did not have good service anywhere and my battery did not last all day and i am not on it very much. other than that the phone is fast and works good when it has service.	0
"The phone is a nice size. Fits comfortable in your hand. With easy operating apps. Extremely poor sound quality. Distortion on vidioes,ring tone. notification and swipe unlocking."	0
"The phone is amazing. Unfortunately, the customer support behind it is extremely poor. Purchased this phone back December 2017, had an RMA in March as half of the screen was freezing (look it up on youtube) and exchanged it at the Microsoft store. 6 months later a second screen issue has now occurred, this time the top 1/2"" of the screen digitizer is not responding to touches. This is also a defect and has videos posted online. The manufacturer is very, very difficult to deal with. It takes a minimum of 48 hours for any sort of response and currently they can't even assist me as they don't have these in stock. This is the most frustrating customer service experience I have ever had in my life and I am very disappointed with the company behind this phone, as the device itself was amazing when it worked."	0
"the phone is awesome. i love it, the phone is a slider phone it likes cool. its a little on the heavy side, but it nice"	1
The phone is broken why you sold 	0
"the phone is easy to us and a great value for its price, can make call with ease and text friends and family as well. MY Mother is 60 and she loves hers. dont be scared to buy one."	1
"The phone is excellent, it meet all my need. I have been playing around with all the features for few weeks and I still have a long way to go. My daughter has a new one she bought fro AT &amp; T and I know I got a good deal."	1
The phone is fully charged and shuts off for no reason. It gets really hot even if not being used. Changed the battery for a new one and still had the same problems.	0
The phone is good for the people who aren&apos;t looking for something fancy. It provides all of the necessary functions and is very lightweight as well small in size which is a plus. I Would recommend this phone for the person who is looking for affordability and simplicity.	1
the phone is great easy to use with an affordable price i will recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good blackberry that is reasonable .	1
"The phone is great, very easy to use, smooth great design and finish, how ever the battery life well  isn&apos;t so great, battery lastes like about a day to a day and half but besides that its an awsome phone"	1
The phone is great. I like how its touch screen buttons in the front and the slider wheel makes it easier to browse things. I decided to buy it because i liked this phone so much (the first one i had) but it broke so i got a new one and i enjoy it.	1
the phone is in bad condiction. C- .   	0
The phone is in good condition and works great.  Has a few nicks on side but not enough to take away from the look of the phone.  I love the color which is different because its pink and the slider keyboard works well.  I have no dislikes.	1
The phone is in great shape and works awesome! Thank you so much! 	1
"The phone is just as described, hasnt given me any problems and its just what I wanted. Its great!"	1
"The phone is literally one of the best phones out despite being almost two years old. Ir blaster to control your TV, HiFi quad Dac for better wired music, dual cameras with one being a ultra wide angle, LCD screen (will last longer than OLED), and the best feature is a removable battery. Get more than one battery so you can just swap out during trips. And after two years your phone won't brick because of the battery. Great features for pretty cheap.  For the seller communication was great. I had a situation with my phone but it was 100% my fault for not seeing it. There is a piece of tape on the battery's contacts, blends in very well. Seller helped me with it. Shipping wise was good. I knew it would take a while to arrive knowing the location but arrived earlier than expected. I'm usually skeptical when buying from eBay but the seller is legit and nothing was suspicious with the packaging. 10/10 would buy again. "	1
the phone is my favorite color and i like it because it is cute to me but i just want to know if the phone has internet?	0
"the phone is nice, was beat up more than i thought described, but the type of phone is super................................................................................................................................................"	0
"The phone is not in any form ""new"", it was scratched, dinged, and the phone had been damaged because it could not stop vibrating and the phone would shut down before I could even activate it. The customer service from this company is horrible, they will not get back to you and will try every possible way to avoid sending you your refund, its been two weeks and they have had the phone for almost a week after I returned it and they are still telling me they are looking for it. I read the negative reviews before I purchased but decided to give them the benefit of the doubt, DO NOT BE LIKE ME, DO NOT BUY FROM THESE PEOPLE EVEN IF IT SAYS BRAND NEW UNOPENED BOX ETC. Complete scam and lies."	0
"The phone is not unlocked , it does not meet specifications set forth in the notice.  I think a lack of respect that do not comply with what is offered  and do not give me solutions to the problem  the phone is not unlocked. I want my money back. or to send a phone that meets the specifications . "	0
"the phone is not working with my net10 sim card, and he say that is working with all sim cards. The gay just f... me over for $20."	0
"the phone is ok. but the description is not right because the camera is 8.0 not a 16.0 and the software is att and I don,t like att and don,t say on it only say operating sistem android is why I give two start"	0
The phone is perfect! 	1
The phone is received in a new condition. White color looks elegant and overall a great buy. Highly satisfied  	1
The phone is super phone and with 1 year service you can't beat it.	1
"the phone is used, but in excellent condition better than described. below average price. old version and baseband firmware, easy to jailbreak and unlock."	1
The phone is very fast and quick at responding. The phone is very cool with siri on it and can browse the web alot quicker. bottom line the iphone rocks!	1
"The phone is very tiny, the screened cracked very easily.  Once the screened cracked the phone is garbage."	0
"the phone isn&apos;t reading the SIM card consistently. probably why it was available in the first place, but don;t really know for sure."	0
The phone itself has good features good camera and other applications that can be given its touch screen is good for access to its functions	0
the phone itself isnt a bad phone but is not virgin mobile and screen watch cracked and didn&apos;t say anything about it haveing a cracked screen	0
The phone kept blanking out....	0
the phone look ok but i pluged the charger in and it didn`t work i unplunged it and the charger busted all togather i won`t be buying again from these people!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	0
The phone looked real good in the description and I bought it for my son.  I have never received the phone so my son would not know if it was what he wanted or not	0
"The phone looks good and the price is reasonable. The big problem is the phone was not unlock with sprint,still under contract in someone's name. I can not active the phone, so add to send it back."	0
"The phone looks nice, however most of these phones are defective. I would not buy one used again! Fortunately the seller was very understanding and easy to work with! If you are looking to buy a used phone do not buy this kind."	0
The phone might not be bad but I cant tell since the seller sold me a fake iPhone  And I no because I had a problem with it and took it to Apple Store who told me it was a fake	0
the phone never reached me the sender kept sending me fake tracking number...thanks to ebay i got the money back..	0
The phone only worked for a couple of weeks and then it started shutting itself off and the keys and screen remained locked until the battery was removed and put back in. Waste of money. I emailed the seller and he told me that the phone had a 3 day return policy. Not even enough time to activate it.	0
The phone runs extremely slow and the battery gets hot when charging the phone. 	0
The phone should have had at least 8gb of ram. Simply downloading apps sometimes is a problem because there&apos;s not enough ram. The proccessor is slow and sluggish and the phone freezes a lot. I am very disappointed with LG and the phone(LG L9) is not up to my standards at all. I sent the phone back because it isn&apos;t a good phone.	0
The phone stopped work after one month. Something wrong in the hardware. Absolutely not a good choice.  	0
the phone that i bought was stolen. i suposely bought it from ARP Wireless. Now im trying to get my money back and it&apos;s been a hassel. i was really upset with all this that im having to go through.	0
"the phone the seller sent us didn&apos;t work. So we bought another, the one that actually works is amazing!"	0
the phone turns off bad battery	0
"The phone was a great deal,it was just like new,except for not having to pay over 325.00 for a brand new one. This phone is like brand new not a mark on it. IT WAS A GREAT VAULE in price. Quick delivery as well. Thanks for such a great deal !!!!!!!"	1
The phone was accurately described and came incredibly quick. It is a great phone and the extra 1 gig card is really nice.	1
"the phone was as described and a lot cheaper than getting a new one, the model is awesome and I highly recomend it"	1
The phone was bought and was everything the supplier said it was except the fact that it would not work in my area. The sim card was not for this area so I basically wasted the money for the phone and shipping in the amount of $50..00. I have since bought a phone here of the same model that works great but the battery of the one purchased over E-Bay won&amp;apos;t even work on my new phone. The only thing I can use is the charging unit which one came with my new phone. Pretty disappointed.	0
The phone was clean but no scratches but the SIM card doesn't work only can get 3G service so I'm a little disappointed 	0
The phone was delivered and appears like new condition . Im very satisfied with the phone.	1
The phone was dirty and broken. It was advertised as fully flashed for Cricket and it was not. $40 that would have been better spent by flushing down the toilet. This purchase has made me leery of future online purchases.	0
The phone was exactly as described. The shipping was great and very fast! I received it before the actual date to arrive. I chose this phone because I needed one fast for my husband.	1
The phone was for my son and we did not connect it.  It just like carrying a phone. It was in excellent condition and everything worked properly that could work with a phone not connected.	1
The phone was great...the features are the best and the touchscreen works well. I like the accessories as well..	1
The phone was in excellent condition absolutely flawless.  Unfortunately upon friends delivering it to my overseas location. I found the phone unservicable. I contacted eBay seller & told me it was working before shipping.  ( sure  it was)  anyway due to no courier service able to ship back to them.  I'm stuck with a brick.  There's no compromise with eBay or the merchant.  Due to my circumstances.  I will never buy off eBay ever again as Amazon prime is selling this phone for $250.00 Brand new with warranty. Moral to the story pay extra get new unless you're in country at the time of receiving the items. 	0
"the phone was in good working condition when i received the phone at least that what i though. but the phone was sent to me with a charger that went to a motorola phone which this phone is not. the phone stopped charging so i went and purchased the correct charger to phone, however, by the time i purchased the correct charger the phone battery porter hand been damaged due the fact of the incorrect charger that was sent to the phone. now i am without a phone. it was not even a month before this phone tore up. i am very dissappointed due the fact of how much i paid for this phone"	0
"The phone was in great shape, it just wasn't able to connect to my sim card. i thought if it had a clean imei then it should be able to connect to any sim card... and then when i returned my phone back i still haven't received my refund....not good business at all."	0

"The phone was probably okay, I assumed it was unlocked as represented but after I paid, I found out it was locked and sent it back and then the Seller dropped off the planet and I got no new phone.  So I had to write the credit card company and cancel the purchase.  Pain..."	0
"The phone was received in a timely manner. However, it started to lock up and turn itself off after about two weeks of use!"	0

The phone will only make emergency call. ?? Not Good.	0
The phone worked after we spent another $60 getting a new battery installed.  A disappointing purchase.  The seller had to know the battery didnt work.  I wouldnt order anything else from this seller.	0
The phone worked perfectly even for an international sim it roamed perfectly.	1
The phone works fine but had cosmetic damage it shouldn't have. It was stated to be brand new! It clearly was not! 	0
The phone works great and was in great condition. Shipping was fast and the transaction was effortless. Thanks!	1
The phone works great. It is in very good condition and  it arrived in a couple of days. I would recommend this seller.	1
the phone works well but after i left a bad review beceause it took so long to get the seller left a bad review on my ebay and than asked me to remove mine and they would give me my money back well if you do good bus. in the first place you would not have to worrie about bad reviews and if you get them just try to do better next time	0
The phone would might have been a good phone but the one I bought didn&apos;t work. People couldn&apos;t hear my wife talking on it plus it wouldn&apos;t recieve messages.	0
The Phone&apos;s condition were completly different of what the seller had on ebay. I will never sell something like that. On top of that I got to item from the same seller and he charged me delivery for both of them when and send it in the same package. he said that multiple items was in delivery charge but that was not what he did.	0
"The phones are great. They work with Metro PCS and were in really good condition, though one phone had a few small but deep scratches on the screen, These scratch are not visible when the screen is on and backlit. All in all, I am very pleased with the phones and how quickly they arrived. "	1
"The phones on this listing is NOT new as described. The packaging/OEM box was damaged, although the content of the box looked new (OEM charger, earphones & adapters). The phone itself had a hair stuck underneath the ""new"" screen film on the front and clear oily finger prints underneath the ""new"" film on the back. These protectors were clearly added by someone else than the Samsung factory after the phone has been used. My guess is that these phones are refurbished, they are definitely NOT new. I couldn't tell if the battery is in new or used shape yet."	0
The physical condition was waay worst than advertised.  Scratches marks and dent! I could have gotten vetter quality for that price 	0
the pictures u have are two different phones!!!	0
The power button has a problem with it when it comes to turning the phone on and off . I have to push it so many times before it works. Other than that I think the phone is good.	1
The price was excellent  The color is cool  Similar to a cool Blackberry  well laid-out    The phone was for my daughter. she is very happy with her choice!	1
"The problem is I lost after 4 days received it , sad story"	1
The product arrived sooner than expected and in perfect condition! Activated smoothly and runs flawlessly! 	1
the product came promptly sold to work nice to talk to everyone to explain.I am very pleased with the product item . high quality original design	1
"The product didn&apos;t work, But that wasn&apos;t my worst problem, contacting the resolution center!! First you spend a couple of hours on the computor chating  to no prevail, then they send you to e-mail which they dont answer, they dont have an 800 number to call to talk to a &quot;person&quot; I&apos;ve been trying to get a refund back for 2 weeks now and still nobody answers my e-mails!!! I&apos;ve been in the chat room several times with the same old run around!! Its  been nothing but a nightmare!!! I know money doesn&apos;t mean any thing to them, but it does to me!!!! And I cant get mine back from them!!!"	0
"The product I bought said NEW but the battery kept dying after a few hours of even not using it. I contacted seller but seller is asking me to buy into a warranty. I feel I was taken for my money.   No, I would not buy again over the internet."	0
"The product is a piece of garbage.  After being spoiled with a company issued Iphone at my previous job and having experience with my wife&apos;s virgin mobile Android, I am ready to toss this thing in the trash.  The phone takes forever to change menus, it is not intuitive, and need I mention.... Windows blows!"	0
"the product is good, but I buy the wrong seller.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"	0
"The product is not brand new. The seal is broken. The device is from tmobile(M919), but the box is from international version(I9500, it is written on the box). The battery is not new. It's not wrapped with plastic. The battery is already put into the device. The cable is covered by full of dust and scratches and the original black color is turned to white. Plastic back cover on the phone is damaged by lots of dust. I don't know why this seller is selling this item as a new."	0
the product is the worst of samsung&apos;s production. the phone constantly freezes and its slow as hell. the only problem i have with the phone is its application and how it freezes all the time	0
"The product itself is a great phone. However, the one that I purchased here was terrible. It was not in the condition that the seller claimed it was. Tried to file a claim, and contact the seller with no reply so, all around, BAD DEAL."	0
The product that I received was in great shape and worked as expected. but the best part was that i got my purchase 2 days before it was expected! will definatley shop form this seller again! thanks!	1
The product was as advertised and received in a timely manner.Happy with each detail. Have a nice day.	1
"The product was described as ""Very Good"" condition but the item I received looked brand new! the item was the correct storage size, color, and carrier. It arrived really quickly. very happy with my purchase and will definitely buy from the seller again in the future!"	1
The product was in excellent condition and the price was very good. This was a replacement for a phone that was broken. I am very satisfied with my purchase.	1
The product was just as the seller describe. I am very satisfy with this product and would recommend other persons to buy from this seller	1
The product was not fully functional as described in the product description I had to ask for a refund to buy a different cell phone. Not happy at all how the transaction ended.	0
"The product was sold as new & factory unlocked with a damaged original box hence replaced with a generic apple box ... an email conversion between the seller and I revealed that the phone was unlocked by him & after receiving the phone, while trying to apply a screen guard I wiped the screen with an alcohol swab whic revealed that there were glue marks from an old screed guard still there ... in addition to this the phone memory still had the old users files ... also the battery percentage is at 83% the new iOS details the battery health information ... if you notice all negative reviews detailing a similar situation to mine have been registered fairly recently "	0
The purchase resunto bad because this cell. 3g does not work. I claim this seller i did not fix the problem does not work. I claim this seller i did not fix the problem.  In the place where I live there 3g service but this cel. not what it says it does not bring the technical characteristics	0
The quality is very good. The delivery was fast . I am very happy with the outcome 	1
The RAZR V3A that I just purchased was actually better than the seller described...and seller provided FREE shipping. I have used this model RAZR flip phone for daily for business use since 2007 and this model has performed flawlessly throughout that time. I highly recommend this product and this seller.	1
The refurbished option was not good. The original phone was good but the refurbished looks like a toy with buttons not evenly placed. Not a good quality 	0
"The said blackberry is not unlock as discribed, unlock means it can work outside US with any other sim card network provider. I just inserted sim card and its asking me to unlock before i can use it. "	0
The Samsung Galaxy S5 is a great phone and battery life is very long and the resolution is a 1080 P 	1
The Samsung SCH U410 was just the phone I wanted to buy because I needed a battery cover.  This one turned out to be a working phone which I did not expect.  It was much better purchase than I thought it would be when I bid.  I am highly satisfied w/ the product and the seller.	1
The screen did not work after short time	0
The screen has burned in images of the keyboard and previous installed application icons.   Functionally it works fine.	0
"The screen is out , looks like used phone or not original phone "	0
"The screen it's to small for my phone , I want return this item"	0
"The screen went blank on our phone after a month and a half. I tried communicating with seller about problem and received no response. I took the phone to a local repair store, and they said in their opinion the screen had been repaired previously and that it would cost as much as we paid for the phone to fix the problem. I then tried to initiate a return just outside of 30 days. The seller denied the return without any explanation or response to my original message. If I could give 0 stars I would. Unfortunately I had already given positive feedback right after receiving the phone. This experience would definitely fall into the negative category. I now know to wait and see how the product performs. Everyone but the seller is a loser here. Ebay just lost a customer in me, and I lost $200 thanks to Gillys Smart Phones."	0
"The seller advertise this phone as a public wireless phone, it was not.  Purchasing this phone cost me much, time and the loss of the money that I spent purchasing this product.  It was a major disappointment for me. I don't usually give reviews, but because of the bad practice.  I felt I must leave comments."	0
The seller cancel my order with out reason I would not buy from him anymore 	0
The seller cheated me	0
"The seller described the item in perfect condition and when it came to me, it was the opposite. The cell phone has a problem in the signal. They do not enter the calls. They only leave. It is a scammer."	0
"The seller didn't check phone before shipping out, the rear cammera is bad, the photoes taken are not clear, a very disappointing shopping trip!"	0
The seller don't answer to the message I was send to him... 	0
"The seller had 2 disclaimers, for parts not working and works but only on wi-fi. The Ebay told me just don't pay for it, I see the same disclaimers, but he opened up a case anyway. Please don't buy from this seller"	0
The seller haven't with the EBay requirements for transaction. I end up cancelled deal with seller	0
"the seller is a scammer sending a copy phone, a Chinese imitation of Samsung, is a scammer"	0
The seller is great and I will definitely buy again. Thanks 	1
"The seller is too clever to take responsibility and Ebay were equally easy prey for his hunting skills, no help. The phone was not factory unlocked. Rooted device and he got away with it. I'm moving Amazon from now on. This should not have been tolerated. I'm disappointed that the guy twisted my facts and sold Ebay the results! "	0
"The seller listed in his add- (1) Net 10 cell phone complete with accessory kit, 300 minutes and 60 day service.  When I went to activate the phone, I was unsuccessful.  I was unable to use the serial # or sim # to assist me in doing so.  The phone should have come with a card for 300 minutes, which it didn&apos;t."	0
The seller not are serius about the sales 	0
"The seller provided 1 year warranty, but when it broke they told that they can not do a thing about it... Nurmals ne? "	0
"the seller said it was UNLOCKED, and the phone wasnt, battery was inflated! (dead) bad description! phone is great! but this one needed to much investment to make it work the unlock code itself was $30 dollars, seller should be honest and tell the truth"	0
"The seller says the phone is unlocked. Actually, it is locked. It requires the code from the previous user. I requested the code from the buyer. He did not provide me with one, suggesting me to buy one from a third party. I did not, because the phone did not give me the option of typing in the code. I suggested to return the phones. My request was ignored by the seller. I am very disappointed! can't recommend this seller. Bad experience!"	0
The seller sent me a email on Friday with the tracking number indicating that the item had been mailed out that day.  Two days later on Sunday the seller notifies me that the item was damaged while packing it so payment had to be refunded.  So clearly the seller had not sent out the item on Friday as the email statement.    To add insult to injury Paypal refuses to refund my money immediately.  They provide the seller with an immediate credit into their account but they don&apos;t do the same in the reverse.	0
The seller sent the item out the same day and was great with communication. I couldn&apos;t have picked a buyer to purchase my father&apos;s birthday gift from.	1
the seller sold a bad phone that you can not activate it had a balance on the p[hone  the seller was vary rude  Lied to ebay  cheated and stoled from me 	0
The seller that was salaries is honest and kind. The phone did not work so she did not send it out because it was broken and refunded the money without hesitation. 	0
The seller tried to scam me.... it is an iPhone 3G and it won't even turn on. 	0
"The seller was dishonest with his description on the listing. I received the item with a broken rear camera lens (camera does not work only the selfie camera) and also, the flash does not work so I decided to contact the seller but it took him two days to reply to my message. I bought this phone as a gift for wife to celebrate our wedding anniversary, we like the phone so I ask the seller to give me the warranty information he promised on the listing so that I could get the camera repair at a local Apple store. This is what it says on the seller listing for this phone: '' The device will be warranted through me for 60 days.  The warranty will cover manufacturer defects.  The device also comes with the remainder of the Original Apple Warranty that is issued with each device until October 2016!!'' We already transfer all our personal information on this phone so I ask the seller to give us a discount from the purchase so that we could repair the camera lens at a local Apple store/shop. On the listing you would never know there is a crack on the rear camera lens because the seller did not have an up close picture, I then visit his other phones on his eBay listing and see that he had photos of up close picture on his other IPhones rear camera lens except the one I bought. This tells "	0
The seller was misleading in saying this phone was fully functionable! the phone came half falling apart and turns on and off. This product does not in fact work properly at all!!!!!!!!!!!	0
"The seller was very nice and considerate. speedy shipping. however, the phone did not hold a charge. a new battery was sent and the phone still did not stay on. it would randomly turned off. the seller was very helpful and speedy in helping me and did give me a refund."	0
The seller would not let me send it back as it was a wrong item ordered.  When I tried to get it to work it would not even come on.  He was going to charge me if I returned so I marked it up as a thing I will have to live with and be very careful when ordering items on Ebay.	0
The service was ok and it came a day early witch was nice but the only thing that wasn't very nice was that they sent me the wrong provider. It said sprint but when I went to go activate it they said it was not registered with sprint. 400$ for nothing. thanks 	0
"The shipping was super fast, my daughter just loves the phone! She waited a couple of days and it was here, it was very affordable too."	1
The Sidekick was in the original box as discribed. Lot of great features without the contract.. was delivered on time. My son absolutely loves it. Will buy from this person again.	1
The sliding keyboard doesn't work so well and there are scratches all over the item not worth 35$!!!!	0

"The speaker phone doesn't work, but Bluetooth does.  You pay for what you get.  It's an over all ok phone.  My 2 year old likes the display.  Gets too hot when playing games. Maybe I just bought a lemon."	0
"The support is terrible for Verykool devices. There is no phone support listed on their website, even for technical, only email which is alarming because phone are electronic devices that may encounter problems and they are not cheap items, can go up to over $200! When writing to them I was told you can find it on facebook but there are more than 11 facebook pages and if you are not a member, you'll have the hassle of joining and when you get to their location page, they only have cities NO street address. There is a cell phone accessories Amzer with items under $10 where you can contact them by phone, email, live chat, facebook AND they post their address if you want to snail mail them! Do you REALLY want to buy a phone where it's VERY difficult to find a way to talk to them on the phone???  This is a criticism of the manufacturer NOT the seller!"	0
"The telephone is good, BAD ARE THE SELLERS, that when the bid is won and they do not like it in the price that one wins the bid they cancel the purchase, and they say that the address is wrong and they have already sent to the same address, I do not recommend them."	0
"The title says it all. I got this phone and it died whenever the battery was around 50%. Super annoying, but mistakes can happen. I asked for an exchange and was told that the new phone would be sent only after they received the first. I requested they send it first and Ill ship it after so I wouldnt be stuck without a phone for a week. They took forever to answer and came back with a no. I offered to pay for the second and have them refund it once my first was received. Again they took a few days to respond with a no. So I ordered another phone from them (which took a long time to get to me!) and then requested to return the first. They responded too late I can only exchange. I was in contact with them throughout and they would always take 2-3 days to respond so they really wasted my time. And the best part...the second phone I got was worse than the first! Every time I opened my camera app, the phone would die. Every time I tried answering the phone, it would die. Customer service again was useless.  Sooo frustrating! Stay away at all costs. "	0
the touch screen should be push harder to work.it is far from iphone where ou could touch slightly and it respond immediately.	0
The transaction was excellent.  The phone I received has poor workmanship.  The seller was willing to send me a new one and pay for the return shipping cost.	1
"The TXTM8 is a sliding-style phone, equipped with QWERTY keyboard, and a few ports for different forms of input/output (charger &amp; usb, memory card, earbud/headphone jack). It is about the size of a powder compact, which is good if you like saving space in your bag or pocket. While the buttons are pretty small, they are still rather easy to use.     The TXTM8 can either be bought in conjunction with one of Cricket&apos;s regular wireless plans (with the activation fee being $15 maximum) , or with one of their PAYGo plans--and none of the Cricket plans require a binding 2-year contract. With PAYGo, there are no extra fees or taxes to pay--those are already included in PAYGo&apos;s $45/mo. plan. You are only charged for the days you use your phone to call, text, or surf the web(no charge for web if you are only looking at Cricket&apos;s webpages, such as the Cricket Storefront).    As a PAYGo phone, it would cost $79.99 at a Cricket Wireless dealer, plus tax. $5.00&apos;s worth of service (or 5 days of talk) are complementary upon activation (which you can do online, by phone dialing *228, or in-person). If you want a nice smartphone without being bound to a 2-year contract, the TXTM8 is one such savvy option offered by Cricket Wireless."	1
"The V10 is the first phone I enjoyed using, thus this was my 3rd LG V10. At $195 this was a steal since it still ~$230 2nd hand on Amazon. Even though mine drowned during a river hike, it reincarnated without audio some weeks later. The 2nd one was purchased for my wife and the 3rd one was for my father in law. I've now converted 2 former phonophobes to the religion of staring down while twiddling thumbs that most of the world seems to love.  This phone arrived on time and was in immaculate condition (new). The OEM charger wasn't included, however the after-market charger supported LG's fast charging. A pair of extremely cheap headphones were also included, we used it to ensure that the audio port was working."	1
"The Vivaz U5 is astoundingly difficult to work with. The touch screen frequently fails to register touches. This is frustrating and slows down any operation requiring sequential entry such as, oh, a phone number or text message or WiFi network key. I mention this first because apart from turning it on and off, turning the volume up and down and taking a photo everything is done via the touch screen.    I bought this product to see if the Sony Ericsson iteration of Symbian 60 v 5 was any better than the Nokia version on my Nuron. It is not.    Compared to the Nuron the Vivaz lags in all departments except the camera. First, as sad as some people think the Ovi store for Nokia devices is the AT&amp;amp;amp;amp;T store for the Vivaz is worse. Even a simple utility like a battery meter is hard to come by. Secondly the Vivaz portrait keyboard is very close to unusable. The home screen arrangement is limited and limiting. The signal strength meter fluctuates wildly while the device is sitting still and there is no discernible change in the environment. The battery cover will be voted &amp;amp;amp;quot;Looks most Likely To Break In Everyday Use&amp;amp;amp;quot;.    On to what works.  1- video playback is smooth and vivid.  2- the camera takes okay snaps and has a flash  3- the three buttons along the bottom of the front work well and feel right. Not true of the On/Off button.    That is about it. I got so frustrated with the touch screen I never made a call on it. I sent two texts and it is now on the charger getting ready to go back in the box and back up on eBay. I write this review as a &amp;amp;amp;apos;truth in advertising&amp;amp;amp;apos; piece. Yes, I want folks to buy my phone but I also want them to know they are buying a camera and video player that sucks at making calls and sending texts."	0
"The W810i is an amazing phone. Since this one is Manufacturer refurbished, there is missing some minor things on the phone, such as the small metal pole on the bottom right used for putting the phone on a keychain, but that is very easy to look past, since the phone is of such good quality."	1
The whole operating system was wiped when we got it so it was worthless. We couldn't even get our service provider to turn it on. Useless.	0

THE WORST SELLER TO BUY A PHONE FROM.  I BOUGHT THE LG G4. IT WAS THE 32 GB. JACK SENT ME A BROKEN PHONE AND NOT THE ORIGINAL CHARGER OR BOX AND THE BUBBLE WRAP WAS NASTY AND SMELLY..BEWARE DON'T BUY FROM THIS SELLER.JACK DIDN'T GIVE ME MY FULL REFUND AND TOOK OUT $17.80 IN ITEM DEDUCTIONS AND I DON'T KNOW WHY.  I SENT HIM EVERYTHING HE SENT ME BACK IN PERECT SHAPE. PLEASE DON'T BUY FROM JACK.. BUYER BEWARE..I WARNED THEE.	0

There is no communication... this was the worst interaction i had on ebay. I have wasted my time on this web site.	0
There more than what they describe about the phone on eBay. They tell me that this phone had problem and told me see if Motorola cut warranty the phone. Ya ok. That's not case. It had problem internal problems with the software. I spent 154. For this phone and not happy at all. I notify eBay about this person.	0
"there was hardly a scratch on it and the system works perfectly! my camera will make whirring noises when i try to open it, but it will still open and the quality is never affected! good product, good price"	1
There&apos;s no dislike about it. If your an android lover then this phone is a piece of cake. Its very light and styles and will become a part of your everyday uses. Plus the 5.0 mega picelles camera is great for picture taker. With its flash lighting that allows you to take picture anywhere also zoom the option will let you to take the perfect shot... just cant go wrong with this phone. Give it 9 out of 10	1
"These are great little phones. They can be updated to the latest version of Android with a little hackery, which is great. Only draw back is the battery life. You can order a 2450MAH battery for about $5 and that fixes the issue for the most part. Other than that, no real issues with the device. Great starter phone or backup. Great value for 50-$120 Depending on condition, and other factors."	1
"These are tough, long-lasting phones.  We just used our first one to death, and my husband is one of those HARD on phones kind of guys (drops them alot, in and out of water).  Glad we found these phones!"	1
"These Lumia 820&apos;s are a really good deal. They can be upgraded to the latest 8.1 software release and have a very good Zeiss 8.9 mp camera that works much better than the reviews say, especially in low light. The 8gb of internal memory and Qualcomm Snapdragon processor give really good performance, not to mention 1gb of ram. I have had no problems at all using a 64gb memory card. If you can pick one of these up for under $60 -- go for it!     Wireless charging is supported, but you will probably have to buy a new back cover, which is about $15 or so. Finally, there is the &quot;clear black&quot; display, which adds more contrast and better outdoor performance, and is unique to Nokia.    The only bad things are the fact that it is not super thin and light, and although the 8.1 release has improved battery performance, you will have to get an extended life battery for $15 or so to get something that is close to and iPhone in battery performance. Cricket and MetroPCS are giving away Windows phones, but they do not have the Zeiss camera or wireless charging or 1gb of ram."	1
These phones are the biggest pieces of shot I've ever had in my life	0
These were a perfect fit for my cell phone. Product is great and price is right. This seller ship fast and I will recommend this seller to other buyer.	1

"They will send you a fake tracking number delivered on your same state, but different city. They were probably hoping their scam will slide through and buyers won't complain since after 35 days of not saying/reporting anything, that will remove your eBay buyer protection! Nice scheme!  If you do complain, message them a million times and don't hear anything from them. Try calling them and ask for a refund, they will tell you that they will ship the item to you and you will get the ""right tracking number"". Wait for a couple of days and 'Voila!' you will get a totally different phone that is not as described from their item description. Bought a new phone for the price of $219.99. Expect to get a cheaper version of it in a crappy packaging, opened and destroyed box. Besides that you'll see that the plastic protector of the phone itself looks like it has been taped by a 2-year old! Try and report the transaction to eBay they will favor this fakers because they gave the ""right tracking number""!  Probably other people had a better experience than me with this company, but you will see from others who also gave them a negative feedback that they had the same experience!

"This has all essential basic features for a cell phone. The sound is clear.  Various ear pieces hook into it to allow hands free conversation.  It is compact and folds easily for putting into pockets.  It is durable.  For Verizon users, it is easy to activate by inputting the code number under the battery and following the instructions on the verizon wireless web sit.  Due to the current low cost of the recycled SCH A650 cell phones and the ease of activating replacement phones, it makes good sense to keep a spare around.  Thus, it is easy to replace a lost phone and to retrieve phone book data from the verizon wireless backup assistant system."	1
"This has been the purchase from you know where.  I will never ever purchase an item based on it&apos;s description in EBay again, especially not for a cell phone again.  The listing for the cell phone that I purchase read that the phone was unlocked, and that was the attraction that made me buy it, but when I received it, my excited slowly faded.  At first, I was excited and unopened the box and charged up the phone. After charging, I attempted to use it. To my dismay, it was not usable.  It required a pin code to unlock the phone.  Subsequently, I took the phone to an unlock specialist at a Cell Phone Repair company in my area and that still did not work.  Granted, if it had work, then I would have needed to pay $32 for the unlocking service of which, I had no plans to spend extra monies for a phone that was supposed to be unlocked from the very beginning.  It looked good, and the Wi-Fi in the house worked fine with it but the phone could not make or receive calls and the owner of the Cell Phone Repair Shop stated that the code he entered to unlock the phone for me to make as receive call was constantly rejected, so he gave up trying, and so have I.  I am in the Armed Forces and I need a phone for my job use and daily contacts.  I thought I was getting a bargain, but this purchase gave me several headaches and kept me out of the loop at my job for some time while waiting for it to be unlocked.  So for the reason that it is listed as being unlocked when it actually is not, I am requesting a refund and will stick to buying phones with a hands-on appeal from hence forth."	0
this I am quite sure is the cheapest plastic phone I have ever owned.....and I have owned dozens. Dont take a chance of this phone!	0
"This iPhone 6 Plus its all I need !!!  For pictures , video , and applications too ."	1
This iPhone did not work with my Verizon carrier.	0
"This iPhone is one of the best phones ever! even though it is 3 generations behind the new iPhone 7, it is still very fast and very functional! i would highly recommend buying this iPhone!"	1
This iPhone was working perfectly fine for a week and then the iMessage stopped working all of a sudden. I have been trying to return the phone but I was unable to get in touch with the seller. I need a refund ASAP.	0
this is a bad phone. basically this phone was stolen. so we could not activate it. straight talk said that either this person did not buy the phone from the store and stole it or the store didnt scan it right.	0
"This is a crappy phone. The touchscreen barely works, always drops calls the camera is crappy and the Internet browser is not that great either. Phone was not worth the money!!!"	0
This is a fake refurbished item. The imei shows that its a yellow model and the actual phone is black the camera is also fake i don't recommend buying from this seller the charger is not new have scratches and marks everywhere.. speaker also is porley working.. the battery is used.	0
This is a good deal & a good quality phone.	1

"This is a great little phone and it's my long-time favorite. I've replaced this model 3 times, this being the third time. It fits perfectly in my pocket and though I use a Motorola Droid Maxx (XT1080), I keep the Razr M (XT907) as a backup and to play on."	1
"This is a great phone and held up to my husbands work day. He actually broke 2 believe it or not. The first was accidently run over by two buses, and kept working for a while except for the broken screen. Then I got him a new one, and it fell when it was open and broke in half. So suffice it to say they are not indestructible, but they are very sturdy. He is usually picky about the buttons on a phone. He loved everything about this phone, the first one we got new from Verizon the second off ebay. I will try to get him another one off ebay in hopes to save money. Overall great phone!!!"	1
"This is a great phone for listening to music. I really like this phone model. I like its features, design and opportunities."	1
This is a great phone for those used to the full keyboard.  I downgraded from blackberry to this phone with ease.  Much nicer then most basic cell phones out there and price is a decent value.	1
"This is a great phone right up there ""almost with"" Samsung Galaxy series, iPhone, or Nexus 6P. If you don't want to pay top dollar for the top end phones buy one of these for a lot less and get very satisfactory performance."	1
"This is a great phone!! It has everything I need in a phone, and it is not big and bulky like other sliding phones with the qwerty keypad."	1
"This is a great phone, i would reccomend it to anybody who likes texting.    Pros: Big bright screen, easy to use, TONS of apps, full keyboard, battery life.    Cons: When the keyboard is opened, the bottom (when upright) or right side of the the phone gets in the way a little and takes some time to get used to.    Overall a great phone"	1
"This is a great phone. Dust, rain, and rough treatment don&apos;t phase this phone. I get a good strong signal in places I couldn&apos;t get a signal with other phones that cost more. I have to wear hearing aids and this is the only phone I have found that is hearing aid friendly. I hope Samsung always offers a phone of this quality . I have several friends that have this phone and you couldn&apos;t get any of us to switch. A person can do anything you need to do with this phone. The PTT (push to talk) feature is nice."	1
This is a great phone. It is fast and has a great battery life. I use this product for personal and business. The screen is just perfect. It is not too big nor too small.	1
This is a great phone. Very fast and easy to use. I switched from a Windows phone to an Android but I just didn&apos;t like the Android phone. I switched back to this phone which is a big improvement from my old 521. Love the phone.	1

This is a great starter phone for a young person. Inexpensive and fully functional.	1
this is a joke I never got the phone	0
This is a nice phone for the money. Works fine for my needs.	1
"This is a piece of crap, it won't read sim card. It says invalid sim card, I try resetting and cleaning the sim card slot, but nothing happen. It's very frustrating"	0
"This is a real scammer, the description in their articles is a hoax and evades everything to not solve the claims, it is not good to buy from this seller. is scammer "	0
"This is a replacement for a broken one same model.  this works fine, came fast.  Very little evidence that it was used; screens were clear, only a few minor very small scratches."	1
"This is a sturdy phone, and great for someone who does not want a smart phone.. I bought an Alcatel from sprint and it was terrible. The processor was so slow that it locked up all the time. This phone is a much better choice. "	1
this is a use or refurbished cell phone it is not new as they say i can't use it the guarantee is not true 	0
this is a very durable phone. Its battery lasts and lasts when my iPhone has already died on my amtrak or greyhound. I carry both iPhone and this one. This is very dependable.	1
"This is a very high quality mobile. Very easy to use, excellent performance &amp; design. There are a lot of apps to install on it. Nice games with good graphics.  The only missing thing is a flash for the camera wich is only 2megapixels, but rasonable photo quality."	1
"This is a very nice phone overall.  It is a nice thin design, and a very tough phone that handles lots of abuse.  Unlike other phones I had in the past, I can actually hear this one ring.  The camera works better than your average cell phone camera.  The dial up networking was very easy to figure out.  The menu options are very organized in this phone as well, compared to other phones I had in the past.    The seller I dealt with was very good to work with as well, and the phone came very quickly.    This phone is an excellent choice for anyone.  I didnt care that it was pink, since it worked so well for me."	1
"This is a wonderful cell phone!  It is everthing you said, it would be.    Thank you for the fast shipping! My other phone was barely hanging on."	1
This is an amazing phone if wanna have a simple phone.	1
this is an awsome cellphone Works great and making it a unlocked! id definitly buy again with the great Price and service	1
"This is an excellent phone running the Windows Mobile 5 OS. The quality is outstanding, and it is very easy to learn and use. With the Windows Mobile OS you can truly do just about anything you can do on your PC plus have all the conveniences of a cell phone. Sound quality is very good. There are only a couple of drawbacks. The back battery cover is flimsy, so you might want to get a spare. This is a common complaint. The slide-out keyboard is full QWERTY, and easy to use even though a little crowded. With a little practice you get used to it. The touch screen is very responsive but you do have to use a stylus. One comes built-in and you can find spares on eBay for not much (try the ones for Nintendo games). Overall a five-star device and well worth the money."	1
This is an excellent phone. The service provided us also efficient and excellent. 	1
This is an old phone. Bought it as a joke and don&apos;t even have a charger for it. It is great as a gag gift but probably not very useful with today&apos;s technology.	0
This is being advertised as brand new. My unit came in and was unable to detect the sd card. When I contacted LG I was informed that it was a refurbished unit and not under warranty. I am returning this unit	0
"This is by far the best small sized phone, does almost everything a full sized iPhone does and is much cheaper."	1
"This is extremely good value if this is true. Ebay should be able to quickly identify these type of sellers where the main objective is perhaps to accumulate capital at the expense of Ebay buyers. Yes, ebay will refund but in the meantime, the buyer is left waiting and waiting for the product to arrive. The seller does not respond anymore when asked about the status of the order. These type of sellers should be banned immediately in Ebay as it puts a dent on the online buying experience. My confidence in ebay is beginning to get eroded because of this type of sellers and others who claim one thing on their product page but it is not. "	0
"This is hands down the best unlocked phone you can ever own. Compare this to any flagship out there and I believe this phone is much better. Better than the new Iphone, Galaxy or new LGG5 phones out there. I had the OnePlus 1 before I got the Nexus 6p and I don't regret it one bit. If you don't know much about this phone do your research and get your hands on one immediately. It is buttery smooth and is up to date and will be the first to get updates straight from Google. NewEgg was the best alternative if you can't find it on the Googlestore do yourself a favor and avoid the gimmicks and bloat of other device camps and get you a carrier free Nexus device!"	1
This is just a Quick Note to let People know if they purchase one of these Phones it isn&apos;t tested by UL in the USA.  Also the signal strength on these phones aren&apos;t the best.  When the signal strength is poor it will also drain the battery quicker... Charger may also pose risk for Fire.......	0
"This is my 2nd PRIV. The first one suffered a drop and a cracked screen, this one is its replacement. So far so good, I have had no issues getting activated with Verizon or any functional issues. I think the PRIV is a pretty good phone. When they were selling for $375 they were a great value, now that they are down to less than $200 they are an amazing value! Screen is very sharp, camera is also very good. Keyboard is innovative. And the processor is decently fast. A lot of people who see me typing on it ask what it is, and tell me they know someone who would like a phone like this. It seems the only marketing BlackBerry did was to send emails to people who already had Blackberrys. It is really a shame these didn't catch on, I would love to have seen an updated, 2nd Gen version of this.  There are a few drawbacks. The phone is larger than I would have guessed, it is nearly the length and width of a Galaxy Note 5. I didn't really expect that when I bought it, but it makes sense that it needs to be wide for the keyboard to fit. Cases and other accessories are somewhat limited. Lastly I think this format is likely more fragile than a more traditional phone. Overall I really like mine and I am not sure what I will get when this one wears out. "	1
This is my favorite cell phone now! The buttons are very large and easy to use. If you are tired of the touch screen and want to go back to the easy phones with big buttons then this one is for you!	1
"This is my first smart Phone, and I was pleased to have purchased it. This refurb model is in excellent Physical condition, and it all seemed to work as designed  , , ,for a month.  However, even after re-installing the Android Operating system (v. 4.4.2, the latest one available for this model), the phone will not dial out reliably. Because the phone/Android systems are not current, it seems not possible to upgrade it and get it working properly. I don't know if it's this particular phone, or if all Enacts are this way.  I cannot rely on this phone, it's past the 60 day return time, and I will need to replace it with a  phone that actually makes calls."	0
"This is my first very bad experience bidding and winning an item on ebay. Please do not do any business with this seller. I tried numerous times to communicate with this seller with absolutely no response for nearly one month. I was forced to file a case and ebay has issued a refund to me. I hope this is a one time problem. Sincerely, jackie jo"	0
"This is my second Droid 2.  I would still have my first one if I could just stop dropping it. I really only have two issues.  1st - it&apos;s slick and hard to hold on to (lol) and 2nd, the shiny screen can be hard to see on a sunny day.  The gmail feature effortlessly transferred all my pics and contacts which saved me a lot of time, the slide out keyboard is handy, the microphone makes it very easy to draft texts &amp; emails.  Plus, it&apos;s nice to be able to check facebook, email, news and weather.  I&apos;ve also ordered a rubberized cover to help me hold on to it.    My spouse has a blackberry from work and hates it."	1
"this is my second one of these, i think they are a good ,tuff,easy to use . i live out in the country and the reception is very good"	1
"This is my very first iPhone, and while the features of the phone are great, I am very disappointed in the battery life.  With all the craze about the iPhone I honestly never expected such a poor battery performance. Guess I never read enough reviews on the 4S. All these wonderful features are to no avail if the battery constantly die on you while using them."	0
This is not a iphone 6s plus. This is just a regular 6 plus. Don't trust this seller avoid this seller. lies unresponsive .	0
"This is not an unlocked phone. I purchased for my mother who is living in Sri Lanka. I have sent it to her, but it cannot be used since it is locked phone. Now, there is no time to get it back and return. I lost my money and highly disappointed about the seller.       "	0
This is not the phone you requested is different from the offer.  What is this monument sending me a dilapidated phone with a broken lid.	0
this is one of the best phone that samsung has made unless there is an upgrade - it also has one of the fastest process and many accessories	1
"This is one of the better phones that I&apos;ve owned. It&apos;s small and sleek. It&apos;s easy to use and very easy to personalize. The battery lasts FOREVER and doesn&apos;t take very long at all to charge.  My only problem is with the buttons. My last phone had rather large, &quot;clicky&quot; buttons and this one has very small, soft buttons. It takes some getting used to but it&apos;s totally worth it."	1
"This is one of those equipments that never gets old, very versatile, called the attention of every one by its yellow color and is a nearly indestructible unit, there is no denying the current phones have 80% more features than the sansung Rugby A837 but for hard work, exterior exposure and simplicity there is nothing better than sansung Rugby A837. Samsung Rugby is like an antique car you want to display shimmery at an auto show. This&apos;s my exact description of this phone"	1
This is phone is the finest budget phone I ever had. Motorola made the  best mobile camera available on this device. I got the phone perfect on time from best buy. I highly recommend this product for any one who wants high end phone without breaking your pocket.	1
"This is refurbished, I enter the code check to the phone was supposed to be black.  And the back cover buckle not live, may be the seller replaced the motherboard.  Loud speaker volume will break the sound."	0
This is so damn frustrating! You sent me the wrong size!!!! 	0
"This is the 4th iPhone, Ive purchased... So I know that while this is the lowest price, it is definitely the best quality!"	1
"This is the best phone available today, and it isn&apos;t close.  3 of my friends has an iPhone 4 and the competition isn&apos;t even worth discussing.  The Evo is much faster, more fun, apps are cheaper on the andriod market, and overall more fun to use."	1
"This is the best phone I have ever owned. I got this instead of the Motorola Electrify from US Cellular because of the huge difference in price. This phone has been nothing but great so far. It runs fast and smooth and the virtual keyboard works perfect. I text faster on this phone then my Samsung Acclaim even without a real QWERTY keyboard. It has a great touch response and feels great in my hand. It is thin and light even with the Otter Box case I have put on it. The battery has very decent life as long as you use an app to kill programs running in the background you are not using. It is also great for games. I play Need For Speed Hot Pursuit on it daily. It has better graphics than even newer PSP games and runs and loads fast. The only suggestion I have for keeping it running fast is to make sure any app you download is moved to the SD card if available. It also has the fastest download speed I have seen for a phone on the 3G US Cellular network. With full bars I download from Android Marketplace at about 450KB a second. I&apos;m not certain on the upload speed, but pictures you take with the 5 megapixel camera upload to Facebook in about 3 to 4 seconds."	1
"This is the best phone to buy when it comes to listening to music! The Chocolate series are the only phones that have the scrolling feature built into the phone.  The advantage is that it makes for quick navigating when you have a song list of things.  This phone is the only phone that will make you want to get rid of your ipod because this phone is deffinitly the best phone you can buy to play music.  The main reason being, the scroller.  The phone is simple with no confusing places for applications.  There is even a music button on the side of the phone for quick access to music.  Bluetoothes are easy to hook up and the sync time is very minimal.  The phone is small, lightweight and compact.  All in all best phone I ever bought by far"	1
"This is the contract phone, certainly not from apple store.A liar "	0
"This is the fourth time I have written a note back, The young lady I purchase the phone for is her only communication to her family and friends. She was so happy to receive this phone that has great sound, excellent hearing in perfect shape absolutely perfect doesn&apos;t cut in and out on her she now can receive phone calls that she has been missing  or she used to loose in conversation. phone in perfect condition fast delivery, product was perfect in every way describe, thank you so much for the phone."	1
"This is the Nokia 6230i vs 6230. The &quot;i&quot; keyboard is not as easy to use as the 6230.     I liked the 6230 enough to want to replace it, BUT ...    I purchased this to replace a lost 6230, I could have learned to use the 6230i keyboard, however this is a 2G phone and my contract carrier is ATT who is actively phasing out 2G.     Since my old 2G 6230 was working it came as a surprise that ATT WILL NO LONGER ACTIVATE A 2G phone period. So, if you have a 2G phone working with ATT enjoy it, but don&apos;t think you can replace it with a 2G phone like this.     At this point, unless (but not sure of this point) I change carriers this formally very acceptable phone (to me) is useless.    I&apos;ll put it out on eBay cheap soon, and try to recoup some of what I paid for it. I&apos;m assuming other carriers will still activate 2G? And potentially carriers in other countries?    The seller offered to buy it back for around a 1/3 of what I paid (not including return shipping), sporting of him I must say, but why throw good money after bad?"	0
This is the Samsung that is the flagship and I can use bluetooth to listen to music all day when I ski and still take calls	1
"This is the second Motorola i1 Android phone I have purchased. This review is based on the first phone. I really liked it despite the low rating. It is the first Android designed for IDen the Nextel network. The reception for the Nextel Net is great that is why I won&apos;t switch to CDMA. I love the Push-To-Talk (PTT) it&apos;s great to get someones attention if they are not paying attention to their phone. GPS is fast, but will kill your battery, so get a spare. My first phone somehow got moisture in it so I am not taking it into the washroom when I shower. The humidity killed the WiFi and Bluetooth and Motorola won&apos;t repair it though it&apos;s under warranty. Real SLIME DOGS!"	0
"This is the second RL 4930 phone,I have purchased for use on Sprint/Nextel service. The reception is excellent, and definetly far better then any Samsung phone, that any of my brothers and sisters have tried. The phone is incredibly durable, as I am extreemely hard on cell phones, never have had a issue with battery or charging. This is just a darn good phone, that no one is making a new comparable model. This Sanyo phone out classes anything avaliable today."	1
"This is the tracking #( 9505516003887086084379) I just returned this phone because doesn't work, it is locked and can't activate with any company, thank you, after you receive this item please deposit my full refund to my PayPal account."	0
This is the worst phone I ever had. It is a piece of junk. I bought it new in a sealed box. The phone eats battery like no other and gets very hot. I think half of the battery charge is used as heat! The performance is bad. The phone locks and the only way to unlock is by removing the battery. Do not buy it unless you need it for phone calls only.	0
"This is the worst transaction/ dealer! DO NOT do business with her she is a scam! I paid for my phone on the 3rd and have yet to receive a tracking number or the phone, I have made 5 attempts to contact the seller and she has yet to respond! I am so upset and would never recommend anyone to EVER buy another thing from her!"	0
"This is very good phone ,long life battery, it works great ."	1
"This isn't the seller fault. But the construction is atrocious. Of course you can't ask much for this price but they way they ""engineered"" the SIM and SD slots...After inserted the 1st SIM couldn't get it back out without damaging the connectors..."	0
THIS ITEM HAS BEEN RECALLED! Samsung is sending fireproof boxes for returns so they're pretty serious about not wanting anyone to use them. Why are you trying to sell this & risking people's lives instead of getting your refund? DO NOT TAKE A CHANCE ON BUYING THIS PHONE!	0
This item is in violation of federal laws in trafficking in counterfeit products.	0
This item is so great at so many levels...I&apos;ve always wanted this particular phone and this seller provide a great item and could possibly be the best service I&apos;ve ever received in my ebay shopping experience. Will definitly add this seller to my favorite list!	1
this item Sucks I got it and charged it with 10 different chargers and 2 of them where NEW and it NEVER TURNED ON I even took it to best buy and stuff and every where I went they said... it's broken. WHY DID I BUY THIS FROM YOU!!!	0
This item was certainly NOT as described it was said it would work with my carrier and it does not and its ugly.  Pretty much got told to bad not my problem.  I will NEVER buy from this seller again.	0
"This item was listed as a NEW item, when we received it we noticed the glue holding the box closed was weird but didn't think much of it. We gave this as a gift and when we went to help activate it we were told it has been previously activated to someone out of Nevada. The phone is very slow and doesn't always work as it should. "	0
This item was returned because it did not function right and she had avoided me and has not refunded my money. Poor service!!!	0
"this its the fast-best phone that I have in my hands, its an amazing, beautiful, great phone, its fast, its the best screen resolution, the life battery its excelent because I dont need to worry about charging..."	1
This LG G4 was advertised as Unlocked AT&T T-Mobile phone.  It was network locked to T-Mobile and I was unable to use the unlock tool to unlock the phone.  Returned to vendor!	0
This looked like a nice phone but it&apos;s really hard to set up and the instructions are mostly in Spanish.	0
"This mobile phone is very bad because I bought this mobile phone but l saw that hasnt  head phone and original charger and the board of mobile phone had problems.Then l send back the mobile and I pay 13 Canadian dollars but he did not return the shipping cost to me, due to the fact that the problem was from their side."	0
This Nokia is the most versatile phone I ever have used.  Easy to use and you approach it more of curiosity to enjoy its function.  You will discover several functions that is out of the ordinary...  I love this phone!	1
This one just for one week used 	0
This particular Motorola i1 is a piece of junk. I cannot rate it because 1/3 of the touch screen does not respond to touch. We could not make it work even after we spent 2 hours with Sprint/Nextel on the phone.	0
This person assured me the phone was in perfect condition and worked 100%. Just received my phone tonight and this thing has been charging at 0% since a hour ago. So much for honesty. I don't get people sometimes. Straight up lied and sold me a shit device. Purposely. Why ruin the run of all good reviews from your  past customers? Still charging from 0%....	0
"This person is selling a fake iPhone 7 Plus, the phone looks identical to the iPhone, but loaded with Android OS.  Asked eBay to step in and help to solve the case, but eBay sided with seller and denied to refund the money, same as with PayPal, which I used it to pay for it.  And I won't give up til I get my money back.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS SELLER."	0
This person soled me a phone that doesnt work. NEVER BUY From this person. I personally got  bamboozled thankfully I didnt pay so much for the phone. But this person is a shady I personally wouldnt buy from them again. They sole me a phone then reported it stolen. 	0
this phon is lock i have to pay some mony to unlocked and is not new is he say   i will never buy from this guy agin	0
"This phone arrived in a short amount of time, and works like a charm. Not only was the phone well taken care of, but also had excellent condition for its age. No issues or complaints, but highly satisfied. Many thanks. "	1
"This phone brand is awesome, it meets all my expectations."	1
"This phone came with box opened and pieces missing, yet advertised as New.  Beware."	1
This phone cannot be unlocked an as such is generally worthless. The phone does not have a replaceable SIM and cannot be used as an unlocked phone. Used the phones are worthless. They cannot be used on any conventional network.	0
This phone could not be activated.  When I called to activate the device I was informed that this was stolen....nice...	0
This phone didn&apos;t work properly and the seller don&apos;t answer my emails to return it so I can&apos;t say anything about it	0
This phone does a lot more things than of what i had expected. It was brand new as advertised. And I&apos;m very pleased with this buy.I will recommend this seller and HTC products. They&apos;re both cutting edge	1
"This phone does it all.  Fast processor, good camera and LOTS of memory.  Plus, it holds a HUGE micro SD card (not included).  Being unlocked, I can swap out the sim from my US provider and slip in a sim when traveling in Peru.  After my experience with this LG phone, I'll never go back to Samsung again!  I was a little cautious to buy a phone via internet sales (ebay or not) but THIS phone from THIS vendor is exactly as described and exactly what I asked for and needed.  "	1
"This phone does not hold calls-they are constantly being dropped.  Sometimes the phone is on, but it will not take calls.  After you turn the phone off and then back on it will work again, but for an undetermined amount of time.  Long story short I am using my cracked cheap phone that I bought this one to replace because this one sucks."	0
this phone does not work with T mobile 4G network. only 3G. useless.	0
This phone doesnt send or recieve photos pics emoticons something to do with mms through messages etc i google it and apparently its a huge problem..very dissapointed . 	0
"This phone failed after just 60 days.  The seller indicates that it is a ""clean serial number: and is ""not blacklisted"".  Now that it has failed the seller has indicated that I should take it to Samsung.  I have contact Samsung USA twice, once they check the IMEI number they say they cannot do anything.  I contact Samsung UK since it has a UK address on the back, same, no help.  Samsung Mexico when contacted was able to tell me that the phone is from Thailand.  I contacted Samsung Thailand and they cannot help due to it was not bought in Thailand.   I have visited multiple Best Buy Samsung desks.  No one will help, Not Samsung, Not seller.  The phone is a poor value because you will lose your money."	0
"This phone got me laid. If you ever find this rare gem, you should buy it immediately. They just don&apos;t make phones like this anymore.  cheers!"	1
"This phone has &quot;okay&quot; features, but it doesn&apos;t last very long at all. This is a very poorly made phone &amp; I would not recommend this phone to anyone ever. I sent this phone back immediately when I got it. I thought maybe it was just that the owner hadn&apos;t taken care of it because the screen worked for about 3 minutes (not exaggerating) and it quit.  So I ordered another one just like it on E-bay, and this one the screen didn&apos;t work from the start. So that makes 2 phones in less than a week that I bought that didn&apos;t work. I went online to see if there was a way to fix the screen problem because when the screen doesn&apos;t work, you can&apos;t do anything with the phone and come to find out, these screens go out on a regular basis, I read at least 20 stories of this happening.  DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!"	0
This phone has a lot to be desired. May be capable to do more if you&apos;re an expert with unlocking phones and adding modified software games and apps. but the stock tmobile is just not what you&apos;d expect a smartphone to be.   It&apos;s a window phone...never buying a windows phone again thesuck..	0
"this phone has all the great features needed and recharges in a fraction of the time others take, takes great pictures, and is by far the best phone I've ever used "	1
this phone has been completely worthless. All parts were spoiled.    this phone has been completely worthless. All parts were spoiled.	0
this phone has everyhing you need . i would prefer it over any other virgin mobile phone besides the blackberry .	1
This phone has incrdibly poor reception -- low bars or no bars or service not available.  After 2 weeks with the Motorla V600 I went back to my Samsung.	0
"this phone has nice features, but it&apos;s not good quality, i mean you can do many stuff like original iphone, and it&apos;s not functioning good, it just has camera like others, the GPS is just name also not working in here USA Chicago, so lets say it isn&apos;t functional phone or active."	0
"This phone has not worked well since I got it and my husband keeps telling me that I need to send it back.  i would , but I don&apos;t have the information I need to send it back.  Can I get it?    I bought this as a replacement phone for one like it thatI had. My old stolen phone never gave me any problems.  The phone suddenly turns off in the middle of a conversation or when I start to answer a phone call.  This is very irriatating to the person that I have just paged to call me back on my mobile phone.  The battery in the phone looks pretty beaten up and has to be adjusted frequently.  The phone is crummy."	0
"This phone has so many features its hard to list them all! Has all the basics and many extras like gps, internet explorer, text messaging w/windows, mp3 and lots of downloads! super bargain for all you get!"	1
"This phone has worked great since I've purchased it. Does everything my iphone did, plus it costs 1/3. Cant beat it,"	1
This phone in person looks cheap . I've had a few problems with it not working right. 	0
this phone is a big peice of junk it was fairly inexpensive after i had it for a couple of days i know why.  i give it away to my worst enemy	0
This phone is a great alternative to a flip phone as the querty keyboard makes it easier and faster to text.    It is also a pretty good mp3 player.    Excellent phone for the price!	1
This phone is a little out of date which made it very hard to find. This company keeps a stock of all my favorite att phones including the treo and the blackberry curve. This is now my one stop shop for cellular devices.	1
This phone is a piece of junk	0
"This phone is a waste of time and money. Battery lasts for about four hours stand-by time. To use it i will have to keep it plagued in to power supply all the time. This phone is not a DREAM G2 is a NIGHTMARE G2, it&apos;s totally useless.  Don&apos;t waste your money."	0
"This phone is advertised as having 4GB internal storage. It only registers 1.73GB out of the box. Others found the same thing too late as did I. The phone has a mind of its own. Pictures show a thumbnail of a different picture in the gallery. This makes it hard to find what you want and show or send it. I temporarily solve this by dumping the original ""gallery"" and replaced with Google Photos. The built in messaging would refuse to download pictures. Sometimes removing and reinstalling the battery would help. After testing a dozen other apps, I found one(???) that seems to work as it should. The GPS is pretty useless. I can almost see the satellites, but this phone can't most of the time. My $10 Alcatel was better than this except the screen size. There are no other redeeming features to this phone. It's not the seller's fault as he did his job, but this phone is totally misrepresented. I had already ported my number and contacts over before learning this. Now I'm stuck until I have more money."	0
This phone is amazing! Battery life tops the 4 by so much! It works greatly for everything that I do! Email internet and more!	1
This phone is an amazing phone for kids 10 and up! I bought this for my daughter and it still works perfectly! The camera is great and there are zero glitches whatsoever. Amzing phone	1
"This phone is awesome! Nokia is back in black, Back in black!"	1
This phone is awesome. Super great lg fonts.  Easy to set up.  The people that helped me were hreat.  Used 5 star.  Thinking of calling back to bget the medical aleart.	1
This phone is being  sold over and over by this seller be careful. 	0
"This phone is by far the best one I&apos;ve ever owned. The camera is fantastic, the screen resoiltion beats the iPhone and the speed is incredible."	1
This phone is cute in size and it's perfect.	1
"This phone is exactly what I needed. My old version was pretty beat up, and this black and orange one works perfectly and looks great.  It was easy to switch the sim card and battery."	1
This phone is excellent! I had a Note 4 and was lost and I bought this one!No need for the Note 4..this one does the job!!	1
"this phone is fantastic and I love its practicality of use.  that if he would recommend to a friend, of course if my job and I have gotten two partners buy this item."	1
"This phone is for those who want the power of a blackberry but arent really caught up to the corporate, email, browsers experience. Its a blackberry for those who want a blackberry and love music...for a younger crowd!!"	1
THIS PHONE IS GOOD VERY NICE  	1
This phone is great for texting. Its so small and cute and fits in your pocket!The design is so different.	1
This phone is great!  It works well with my service with no problems right from the beginning.  The battery life and ease of usage has been the best phone I've had.  	1
"This phone is great, it has one of the best value per money I have ever seen. Its the first one to implement NFC and got official JellyBean update directly from Google. Factory unlocked are one of the best two words a phone can have."	1
This phone is great. Buttons are a little small but overall I am real happy. My kids think it is the coolest phone out there. And they know technology better than me.	1
"This phone is horrendous !!! Stay away !!! It would regularly lock up. When you flipped the qwerty open, the screen would not shift. Way too many glitches to list. Awful Awful !!"	0
"This phone is in practically new condition with only 2 tiny tiny Knicks, and no scratches on the screen or elsewhere. The phone's battery works long and charges fast and the camera is the best I've had on any phone capable of shooting 4k video. I am overall impressed by the phone and the price. Other phones is this price range lack many of the features and side this phone has. Would buy another"	1
This phone is just what I needed to get everything together and the camera both from and back is just fantastic 	1
This phone is locked do not buy it.	0
This phone is new and i really like it	1
This phone is no longer supported by the verizon network but they sold it anyway.  I returned it.  Call Verizon with an MEID and or IMEI before purchasing any older phones. 	0
This phone is not compatible with the major GSM 4G networks in the U.S. I bought the phone last year and just got Edge on T-mobile network and H on AT&T's.  Don't buy this phone if you are in the U.S. and want to use 4G data.	0
THIS PHONE IS NOT UNLOCKED 	0
This phone is not working so I&apos;m not happy with that!! So I&apos;m not recommend this item because never told me about this phone	0
"This phone is one of the best I've ever had.  The large 5.5"" screen helps make viewing very easy!"	1
"This phone is packed with features but bit of expensive too. All the features can be used if you are bit of techie..  for e.g.  1) GPS can be used only with  Mobile 7. It is only software out there identifying internal GPS of N95.  2) Firware v12.xxx is slow and need to upgraded to v20.xxx, Help is available over internet how to do it (especially if not purchased in europe)  3) Phone is very light  4) Camera is too good, you never need seperate digital camera again.  5) WIFI is definately can be helpfuly to search over web when needed (only over free hotspot)  6) Screen is very crystal clear.  7) A/V oupt and build in radio are plus and need to carry required accessories."	1
This phone is pimp tight for the price. There is not a better bang for your buck than the J7. It's just as fast as the S7 on 99% of anything your doing. Great Buy	1
"This phone is reasonably priced compared to other phones with many extra features that are convenient. It has a camera, comes with a cover,is easy to use, and it is nice and slim. One thing I do not like is actually the cover which has a huge clip on it. It makes the phone seem big when it is not. Also, the plastic that covers the viewing windows sticks to the phone and makes it hard to see the numbers.    One other thing is that there are not that many ring tones that I really like in the standard phone tones."	1
"This phone is small in size and performance. I was not able to maintain a phone call for longer than 2 minutes and the reception was horible in comparison with my old phone. The audio was poor and it&apos;s bluetooth capability was lacking, it would not stay connected to my earpiece. I gave it to my kid to play with and went back to my trusty old phone; that&apos;s what I get for trying to be fancy."	0
"This phone is so old that I have to turn my own light on; I have to use the side scroll part to move through the options.  Sometimes, when it gets tired, with a full battery, it will shut itself down for like 5 minutes; no matter what I&apos;m doing.  I DISLIKE this phone."	0
This phone is stolen    Be careful whit this person.  Very bad person.    	0
"This phone is supposed to be very water resistant. It suffered water damage from the rain, The digitizer does not work now. I only had the phone working for about 3 weeks..."	0
This phone is the best with intergrated camera and bluetooth flash handsfree it will allow you 2 share the best of ur oppurtunities i think this is a good phone as for me i have been using it. With its nice sleek buttons excellent shaving of the blond technology i love it!!!. This phone is personal for business men and workers it has nice buttons so you can text very fast and call easily	1
"This phone is too old to be selling, alltel wont activate this phone! Would not buy from this buyer again!"	0
This phone is useless. Sprint is not going to be supporting this phone soon. Please do not waste your money. I don&apos;t know much about the phone because I went to activate it and Sprint said that it would be a waste of money.	0
"This phone is very good performance wise, Runs very fast never had a issue. Storage is great with 32gb. Ran fast with 4gb of ram and overall performance wise is good.  DOWNSIDE IS THAT IT BREAKS EASILY. I had purchase this phone with a Spigen phone case and tempered glass screen protector. I had gotten out of my car and it fell out of my pocket, not even a foot or so drop and it landed on the bottom right corner on concrete and bounce into grass screen down. When I grabbed it I was surprised that the right side  of the phone where the edge is was shattered. The led was intact but that glass was gone."	0
This phone is very poor knock off.  Said standby more the 280 hours lasted 8 and was dead.  Talk was about 35 minutes then dead.  Vendor was good and took it back.  Don&apos;t buy the phone.	0
This phone is way better than the iPhone 5S that i was using	1
this phone isnt a octacore. is a sm g930U	0
this phone look nice but if you have another provider than AT&amp;T it will give you very limited features.the phone weight is really heavy.i didn&apos;t accept my 1 GB micro SD card.the battery life is very poor i only stays about 8 hours standby (without using the phone).  i had to return it and loose the shipping fee.	0
This phone looks practically new and is working well so far. It arrived within a week. Im very happy with it. 	1
This phone NEVER worked...from the time of purchase.  What a waste of $$!!!  It was listed as good as new....what a joke.  I could have gotten a new phone cheaper than the time and $$ this cost me.	0
"This phone poorly functions. The speaker and ear piece don't work well and frequently lose sound.  The earpiece doesn't function at all, and using headphones is in and out. Takes good pictures and has a large screen which is nice, but the poor function make this a non-starter. "	0
This phone replaces a Moto X phone. The battery life is excellent and the screen is very sharp. I've only been using it a few days and so far the phone is a winner.	1
"This phone shipped quickly and was in good shape. Very solid phone even after being out for so many years. I did have trouble tracking down a compatible SIM card, sprint didn't have one and I had to order one through EBay.  Phone is a great price for the value you get."	1
This phone sold by the seller doesnt have Proper description and his communication of mails doesnt have proper information either and he is very harsh towards buyers. I would never do business with him again	0
"This phone sucks! It broke 1 month after I received it. The screen went out, parts were loose &amp; the phone was falling apart. Very cheaply made. I ended up changing my service provider because I&apos;d had 4 Virgin phones over the last year. Very bad qulity product. Total waste of money!"	0
"This phone takes the RAZR model to new heights!   Not only is this phone much more ruggedly durable than the Razr V3M, it also has an added feature from K1M technology. The new touch screen music player. It has a larger front screen, with larger time readout, higher capacity for memory, a much better camera, much better volume adjust, and better screen layout. It also is more user friendly than the Razr V3M.    You won&apos;t be disapointed in this RAZR!"	1
"This phone wants to do randimsoftware updates everyday, sometimes skipping a few days, and when it does that it switches the time I'm on my phone which has cause me be late for work 3 different times. I almost got fired. I dont kniw why it does this but I just hit the no button now when it asks. It's very frustrating and the phone is also encrypted somehow now, which my kids could of accidentally done I can figure that out. Thank you Rat Pritchett"	0
"This phone was a great price but it had a bad serial number when I called Net10 to activate it.  They said it wasn&apos;t scanned properly at Best Buy when purchased, so I would have to take it to Best Buy and see if they would scan it, well I didn&apos;t buy it from Best Buy and Best Buy is 100 miles one way from my house and I did not have a Best Buy receipt, so doubted that they would just scan it for me.  So, I contacted the sell, he offerred me 1/2 of my money back less shipping cost.  So, I agreed thinking, I&apos;d at least get something back.  He then issued me a refund for the full amount less shipping, so I guess you win some and you lose some.  This one I lost, a great looking phone, but a inoperable one.  Sincerly, tazetuneme"	0
This phone was advertised a US Cellular phone but it was a Verizon pay as you go phone. I have been unable to use it or sell it and I would like my money back. I have been unable to reach this seller to return it.	0
This phone was as described! It was clean without scratches and so appealing to the eye.  I love it!	1
"This phone was designed by smart people for smart people. It has all the features you could ever want in a smartphone. It is the apple of my eyes in this galaxy. This phone beats the hell out of its competitors. Fast fingerprint unlocking, great camera quality, beautiful screen display and a breathtaking glass and metal body that captures the attention of the world. And the processor speed is another killer feature in this phone and to make it better, this phone has a 4G RAM and extendable memory, dual SIM, dual rear cameras and a battery that lasts all day long. Its charger is super fast. This phone opened up the era of fast charging. "	1
"This phone was exactly what I wanted. I am very happy with it. It arrived on time, and was identical to the picture online. "	1
This phone was horrible it will not charge and I bought it for my sons birthday very disappointed and the seller was no help had to go through eBay for my money back	0
This phone was is excellent shape. Works perfectly. I was truly happy with my purchase. Seller is great!	1
"this phone was not a good phone the screen fell off within 2 weeks, it was just glued on. i might give them another chance but i doubt it."	0
This phone was not possible to make working with AT&T.  Its technical support could not understand what is wrong with the phone.	0
"this phone was posted as NEW. Well isn't new, i would say new other (dents , sign of wear). i wanted to return, but paying shipping i would lose the money i could buy better one"	0
This phone was received in excellent condition. It was everything promised. Three days later my daughter drove over it. No fault of seller.	1
This phone was stolen using my ebay account seller would not help even knowing it was stolen Never did recoup the money terrible 	0
"This phone was the biggest piece of crap I have ever used!!! It always froze up, shut off randomly, the storage space is terrible, the outlet has too much play...I have never had to buy so many chargers for one phone in my life!!! These phones arent even made anymore, they&apos;re so crappy!!!"	0
"This phone was way better than I imagined.  They described the phone accurately, and I had no problems activating it or using it.  I am very pleased with this seller.  They had shipped promptly and I received the phone within 2-3 days of winnng auction."	1
"This phone will not store contacts and numbers. it will not connect to my computer to transfer files, only charges, does not have an accessible  Mac address to register with WiFi"	0
"This phone work great, then after an week the screen quite working. I had to go buy new phone. This was a waste of my money."	0
"This phone works beautifully. Bought a used item. It arrived in a box labelled eBay (not the OEM box). It did not have the tool for opening the sim card/memory card slot, but a paperclip worked just as well. Great battery life. Huge improvement over Samsung S5. The Screen was in 99.9% perfect condition. It was rated a B+ for condition. Very pleased overall."	1
"This phone works great, I have had this phone for 2 years and since sprint took out the second antenna on the galaxy s 4 and 5 (which will not allow you to be on internet and talking on phone at same time). I am staying with the galaxy 3 fo as long as I can."	1
This phone would not activate as they are no longer allowed on Verizons plans. 3G is a thing of the past. Returned to seller who got it promptly to me. Hoping for full refund when they receive it. 	0
"This phone, in theory, is good, but the battery life without use only lasts 5-6 hours.  I bought another new battery with the same results.  Worthless!"	0
"This phones keyboard sucks. You have to restart it constantly for the buttons to work. Blackberry has no apps. The service was crappy on Sprint service. I am sooooooo fed up with Blackberrys. I would not recommend it to anyone, and I recommend selling yours ASAP."	0
"This Product  is do not work please return my money back.I recive this product but is not work , i returned but i do now why ddo not receive my money.  Thanks"	0
"This product did not imagine that the fact that this bad situation  Transmitter and receiver very bad  Very, very bad battery"	0
this product I really liked! price function corresponds to the design! recommend a good estimate of all!!!!	1
"This product is excellent, easy to use and has great apps for the day. I recommend.  The seller was fantastic, always there when needed for doubt. Thank you for selling this product, I am very grateful."	1
this product is very excellent product. i would recommend this to anyone............................................................	1
"This product seemed cheaply made.  Quality in hand was less than I expected based on description.  But it would be the Motorola manufacturing that would address this situation..  Motorola brand is why I chose to purchase this and I do like Motorola products, but this one was of the lowest quality for me."	0
"This product was bought used, even knowing that there was no warranty i took the chance and found that the phone haves intermitent problem( sudenly shuts down)  My fault for not getting a phone with warranty."	0
This product was practically impossible to use. Most of the directions were written in a foreign language and even the small amount that was translated was next to impossible to use. The seller was willing to work with us but the phone was just too much work.	0
"This product was way cheap. Good Value, and snazzy to!  I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a cheap, replacement flip phone."	1
This prooduct is far better than my Tour I had with Sprint. Moves faster w no trackball thk God. Im addicted to my BBM so I have little to say bad about Blackberry products.	1
"This really is the worse cell phone I have ever own.      Undesireable features:    Hard to hold.  Hard to dial.  Hard to navigate the menu.  Hard to find accessories that fit this model.  MOST of all, it&apos;s hard to hear the party you are speaking with."	0
"This reviews pages are nonsense ! You cannot leave 1 star (poor) review just because your seller sold you crap. Reviews should be written for a products and not for a bad sellers. It&apos;s a great phone with many useful functions even with original Android 1.6 OS. It has nice &amp; big screen, good qwerty keyboard and it works pretty fast with original software. Also, you can upgrade it to Android 2.2 if you&apos;re willing to spend some time on community forums. With Android 2.2, G1 gets new life and can be compared with latest Android devices. If I consider eBay prices (in this moment under $100) for a good used G1 phone, I would give 5 stars for this first (ever) HTC Android phone."	1
"This seems like a great phone, but as it is an Alltel phone it is no longer supported on any network. Verizon has recently purchased Alltel and is not bringing over any of the Alltel phones unless you are an existing customer with your existing phone. All new phones to be Verizon phones. This is a very pretty paper weight. Don&apos;t make the mistake of buying one, you won&apos;t be able to use it, they don&apos;t unlock either."	0
This seller canceled my order saying that I requested to cancel. I did NOT request to cancel!!! 	0
"This seller did not indicate that the phone was locked and unlockable. It was only usuable through US Cellular which I never heard of. I paid $400 for the phone and it is worthless to me. When I wrote the seller, she took a &quot;not my problem&quot; attitude. I intend to dispute the item because she refuses to take it back. She did not disclose this to me prior to purchasing. Watch out for her!!!!"	0
"This seller followed agreement to for Fast shipping. When contacted with problem, seller responded rapidly, had great communication and solved problem very quickly!"	1
"This seller has been nothing but honest, fair, quick with response, having all that said this has been an easy transaction and i will be recommending this seller to others and will use this seller in the future. I have nothing but good thing to say and the utmost respect for this seller. thank you so much!!  Sherri Lyn"	1
This seller is a dishonest as it gets. Stay away from them. 	0
THIS SELLER IS A SCAMMER..DESCRIPTION AND ITEMS ARE NOT WHAT HE SEND TO YOU...I RECEIVE THE PHONE THIS AFTERNOON AND ITS ACTUALLY THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT HE POST ON EBAY...	0

This seller is not serious at all he doesnt respect the buyers when money and bids are active !	0
This seller is terrible sold me a phone that has huge unpaid credit balance and left me to deal with the problem alone. Terrible communicator	0
"This seller listed the cellphone as being unlocked, but it is defective electronically and continues to relock on its on. There was no notice in the ad depicting defects, but its a piece of junk. Beware !!!!!"	0
This seller placed the item for sale and once I won the auction cancelled it giving me a refund. EBay says that items are cancelled because they may be out of stock or damaged. It was advertised as in stock and in nearly perfect condition. Why was it even for sale in the first place? The seller would now. 	0
This seller sells a phone which can not connect to the computer to me. And he DIDN'T MENTION IT ON THE DESCRIPTION. Teriable Seller.	0
This seller should be ashamed for selling a phone like that am very unhappy about it 	0
This seller told me he charged this phone before he shipped it to me and does not give refunds or exchanges  this phone want turn on or charge..I will never buy from this seller again	0
This seller was very fast at shipping I got the phone before items that I had bought days before item was just as described thank you very much Ron.	1
This shipping is outta this world 2 day shipping and theres nearly any scratches on the phone and the price is amazing this is like new but it doesn't come with the Samsung box or right charger	1
-This smartphone have a lot of good features  -great design and size  -very good price  ----------------------------	1
This store here in Ebay are liers.Horrible costumer service.	0
"This thing is not NOT and unlocked AT&T phone. When you turn it on, the boot screen says ""SPRINT"". Because of this it is only 3G and not 4G. It will never fully work correctly on AT&T. I've been had. I would return but which liar do I believe next?"	0
This two week later and phone went out. Phone won't work.	0
"This unlocked version galaxy s7 and s7 edge g930u and g935u can NOT be activated on sprint network. When I try to return to the local store, bestbuy local store refused to accept them, saying that I have to ship it to the online store. The receipt clearly prints that I can return it to any local store. But that is a lie.  Op top of paying the shipping, there is 35 restocking fee no matter what if you return a cellphone.  Avoid best buy cellphone at any cost. It is a worst buy."	0
"This was a Christmas gift for my niece. She charged it overnight. as of Jan 4 2016, she is having battery issues.  The phone keeps powering down. Called T-mobile customer support they said its a battery problem. Changed the battery a couple times. It stabilizes for 24 hrs, then goes back to powering down.  I would not recommend buying this phone."	0
This was a gift for my daughter and she loved the phone it is perfect. the phone was in great conditions even tho it was used. i recomend this item to any mom that is looking to spend a limited amount of cash for a phone under MetroPcs.	1
This was a great buy for me. Easy transition from my old phone to my new one. The plastic wrap was actually still on the product.	1
"This was a great item just as advertised.  The shipping was quick and great communication. Thanks, Great seller would buy from them again"	1
This was a great value.  Absolutely love this phone. Better than one&apos;s I found at the stores for half the price.	1
"This was a phone I wanted from the beginning. When I had received the phone I fell in love with it, but after a week and a half of having it all of a sudden it bacame a big problem. I couldn&apos;t view or take pictures. The main screen went blank and static like. I had to open and close it several times before I could see a clear picture. Maybe the phone I purchased was a lemon I&apos;m not sure. But I assure you that I have not dropped or bumped my phone against anything. I wish I could have kept my phone because I did like and enjoy it while it was working, but I wont ever get a phone again that verizon no longer sales again all because of that one experience. I&apos;m not telling anyone not to get it that was just my experience."	0
"This was a terrific value - 49.99 for phone, one year service, 1500 mins, and 1500 texts - was so easy to transfer to my old tracphone and customer service was terrific as well."	1
This was advertised as 3G but it will not connect to AT&T 3G 	0
"THIS WAS AN EXCELLENT TRANSACTION ALL THE WAY AROUND, AND THE PHONE HAS BEEN EXCELLENT ALSO.    GRANDUGHTER&apos;S PHONE HAD BROKEN, SO WAS IN THE MARKET TO REPLACE, CHOSE THIS ONE, AND IT HAS BEEN GREAT.  NEVER LEAVES HER PERSON!

This was cancelled by the vendor.    Never received the item.  Nothing to review so cannot give a positive experience about the product.  No favorable comments for this vendor.	0

"This was my first purchase on an unlocked cell phone. Read all the fine print. My service provider is T-mobile and this phone was blocked from T-mobile service. My fault entirely, I should have read the small print. An expensive lesson learned."	0
"This was my first Windows phone.  I liked it so much, I bought a Windows 8.1 phone and gave this one to a friend."	1
This was one if not the worst experience I have had with online shopping. The phone didn't work battery died in couple hours and it's took around 2 months to get a replacement just a bad experience 	0
"This was sold as a new phone but I have my doubts.  It came in a box with no charger, earphones or manual.  The battery dies very easily.  Every few hours the phone needs to charge."	0
"This was the 2nd time I purchased a Galaxy S4 from this seller.  While the seller was prompt with the initial refund (and I expect them to be so for the 2nd as well), both phones showed significant signs of defectiveness within the first 2 weeks.  I'll be moving on.  "	0
This was the worse purchase I have ever made on ebay. This phone had been dropped in a toilet and the battery was dead and needed replacement.	0
"This was the worst purchase of my ebay history. The seller said it was unlocked and it would come with headphones when I emailed them. I brought it to my phone company and they said it wasnt unlocked and it didnt come with headphones. I emailed the seller, they emailed me back a week after and they said they would replace it for $30, i said ok but they emailed me week a week after again. And the phone had a lot of scratches. I dont recommend this seller and their products. "	0
"This watch is suppose to be a standalone watch using a micro sim card.  It did not work with my 3G ATT sim card.  I could not make or receive calls.  The keyboard is so small  that it is almost impossible to type if text input is required, and it is for many apps.  It does have a workable camera and a voice recorder.  "	0
Thiss phone did not work at all. The screen completely froze every time I tried to use it. The screen had very obviously been replaced so that might have been the problem. 	0

"To me it's a toss-up between the and the M7. I did encounter the 5G WiFi connectivity problem with the Mini 2, but I can get by just fine with 2.4 GHz WiFi."	1
"To start off the phone is sleek and stylish with the only ergonomic unlikable feature being that it has an antenna exposed.  The function of the phone is great and clean compared to my old LG 225.  The text messaging works fairly well with the exception of punctuation and predetermined words popping up even while those functions are turned off.  Again this is a step up from my old phone and if I was shopping for phones, I&apos;m not sure if this is the one I&apos;d go with."	0

Touch screen resolution was horrible. Nothing against the seller. Just the product itself was not user friendly	0
Tracfone sells phones that are made for specific area codes and will not assist you when you try to use them in a different area. They will sell you minutes but then not allow your phone to work . We have retailers including Walmart that sell phones that won't work in the same town as the store is located. I consider this a Tracfone shortfall not the seller.  	0

"Trs bon cellulaire Samsung de base. Si vous ne faites pas de photos, navigation internet et autres, autrement dit, un bon cellulaire pour parler, ce cellulaire est la combinaison parfaite.

"Two stars for great phone condition. Like new. Love it. Fast shipping, great handling time.  One star for seller. The phone came password locked and haven't been reset I had to get the seller contact information from eBay customer service because I've sent the seller a message a couple of days ago and he never responded and so I wasn't very confident on the seller's response time. Contacted the seller through their personal cell left a voicemail and text message and I also left an eBay message as well there was no response. I thought I had to return the product but I found a way to set it to factory reset. I also have to check the ESN myself to make sure it was fine and so far everything clears out. Will not buy from seller again due to lack of communication and phone did not come as described. I had to do extensive research to figure everything out."	0

"Unexpectedly the battery life is too short!!!!!!!!!    it is going off after only two days of standby, after a full charge!!!!"	0
Unfortunately I&apos;m not satisfied with the product because in the description did not included that can&apos;t be use with sync card and my actual company use sync card in all of their product.   The product is not useful for me and can&apos;t return the product.	0
Unfortunately there is no credibility in the description of books not locked but in fact locked	0
Unfortunatley I am unable to rate the product because the owner changed his/her mind and no longer wants to sell the item.  I had to find out about this after I emailed the seller asking when I was to receive my Nokia.  Now I am just waiting for my refund.  Hoepfully I receive it soon.      Disapointed	0

I contacted this seller, TWICE, to inform them that I wanted to cancel my order but they didn&apos;t respond, only to have them ship the order a day later and charged me for it. I filed a fraud claim through Paypal against this seller, and will NEVER conduct business with them again!!!!!!!!"	0
"Very much dissatisfied and frustrated by the deception from the seller, who obviously omitted to disclose before the sell that this product (phone) didn&apos;t have option for using with a SIM card. Now, I don&apos;t have any use for this phone but wasted the money!"	0
"very nice and simple phone. Great display and easy to use. Quick internet and wifi access. Its more like a small laptop, you can easyli change display and icons there (shortcuts). Display resolution is very good for me. More languaes for this phone will be better, its the only drawback for n900, if you live in small country. But english will do everything if you know it."	1
"Very nice I love the style and size its just perfect, I like the way you text from this phone and the slim line design also the screen is picture perfect and very clear takes awesome pictures. And it has all the features you could possibly want in a cell phone the music player is also cool. Graphics and ringtones are cool as well. Just all over this phone would get a 10 of 10 rating over all."	1
Very nice looking and offers good protection	1
Very nice phone at this point love the look of the jet black.	1

WANTED A NEW PHONE.  THIS PHONE IS JUST PERFECT.  JUST AS GOOD AS IF I HAD WENT TO THE PHONE COMPANY TO PURCHASED IT.	1
Wanted one of these for a long time. Only problem was that you could not download to sim card more than 1 number at a time. Had to do it all one at a time! Also instructions did not come with the phone so I am slowly learning how to use it. Otherwise I like it very much( I only love people).	1
Was a gift and it a small easy to use cell phone for my 11 years old niece. It&apos;s a great value for the phone	1

"Was very disappointed in this product. I bought the phone for my son, because he needed a new one, and I didn&apos;t want to extend his contract with Cingular. From the beginning, the phone did not work right. It would not get service where other cingular phones got full service. We took his simcard in to have it checked, and found out that it was the phone, not the card. I wasted my money. I would not buy this phone again, nor would I buy from the same people again. This is the first time I&apos;ve gotten ripped off in Ebay!"	0
Wasn't as described .....Seller refused to answer my questions that my phone carrier told me to ask whoever I purchased the phone from so that they could hook up my service to that phone. Seller would not communicate with me and was very short and rude with their negative response. Instead of trying to work with me and provide simple answers they just said if I wanted a refund I would have to pay a restocking fee in order to get one. Even though they didn't described the item correct in their description when they posted the ad.....very uncooperative and not helpful at all.....BEWARE OF THIS SELLER CAUSE IF YOU HAVE ANY ISSUES WITH SOMETHING YOU BUY FROM THEM WELL YOUR ON YOUR OWN DONT WASTE YOUR TIME THINKING THIS SELLER IS WILLING TO HELP 	0
Watch out for this thief. He never sent the item he bought. DO NOT TRUST THIS SELLER. He stole 300 Dollars for the purchase I made him. Do not do the same to them. WATCH OUT.	0
Way better than paying 800$ for a new one! 	1
"We are seniors who just want a phone with no bells or whistles; one with a strong battery, easy to use functions and stylish enough to not look too out of touch with modern technology.  This phone sure fit the bill in all ways.  I&apos;m going to order another one for my husband."	1
We bought the phone so we could use it to go to the cinema on Orange Wednesdays.  It serves the purpose we wanted it for so it was a great buy for us.	1
We bought this to replace the exact same phone with sprint service but when he took it to sprint to turn it on and transfer his call list they told him that they could do what he wanted because it is a pay as it goes phone meaning he had to buy minutes to use this phone but that isn't what his service is and not what he needs so he can only use it to charge his batteries for the phone he already had but the charging port is broken so it won't charge. So it sucks to spend $20.00 to just use it for charging. 	0
we eat up our phone  in construction..  these phone take drops and falls. it may not look pretty but like the old add says takes a licking and keeps an ticking	1
We got what we paid for.   The phone is really the worse &quot;smart&quot; phone I have ever seen.  I would never recommend this to anyone.	0
We have had lots of difficulty with this phone shutting itself off and the battery does not keep charge.	0
"We liked our S5 Actives because of their durability, so we chose to replace them with S8 Actives and are very happy with them.  They were in good condition and have worked great, so far.  There were a few things that didn't transfer from the S5's to the S8's with the Smart Switch app, but most everything did.  We think, so far, for the investment, its a great deal.  "	1
We needed a new cell phone to get us by until our plan renewal was due. verizon told us we could buy on an &quot;online bidding site&quot; so we chose ebay.	1
"We now have three I-phone 5s&apos; in my house.  I love the size, the functionality and features of the I-phone.  Siri is awesome!  The battery seems to run down quickly, but it isn&apos;t nearly as bad as every android I had.  I was the first to make the switch and I switched every phone in my house.  Never using any other than i-phone again."	1
We purchased a used Sprint cell phone at the end of August.  It worked for 4 days.  We contacted the seller who asked if we would like an exchange or a refund.  We chose refund and never heard from them again!!!!  Not sure if we are interested in using ebay ever again!!!!	0
We received the phone earlier than expected. The phone came as described but the seller also included a car charger as a bonus. Everything works great. I will gladly use this seller again.	1

"Well the best part about the phone was it was very easy ot use and navigate it. i liked the camera and recording videos.    So the problems with this phone is much more common then i knew, from day one of buying htis phone, text messages would lag behind from when they were sent and received(look this up on the internet). playing videos over the internet would always be choppy when connected to wireless, not other phone would have an issue on the same wireless, and videos are not playable on 3g or 4g.   all of this happened on the 1st photon i had. i complained to sprint to get another of the same model assuming it was a fluke.  2nd phone same thing, so i got another from ebay, and yes same thing again.  i delt with these issues by restarting the phone 2-3 times a day.  facebook/weather/app updates would not update or ever show up without a restart on all 3 phones i had.  i have tryed at least 10 other smart phones thru my work (its my job) and none have had this bad of issues.   How this thing has a good review is crazy. get a flip phone over this thing. save your time and money."	0
well this cellphone is the worst ived bought it broke like in 15 daays when i bouhgt it i dooooooont recomend this cellphone to nobody :(	0
well working!.but it has some used symptons.But seller is very good and had a kind heart.i&apos;m very thankful to him .	1
"well, I never received the phone. As in many other reviews ( which I should have read before) the phone did not arrive. I received emails asking me to be more patient several times as delivery delays kept accumulating, but in the end, I decided that it was going to be pointless to wait for more. In all fairness the refund process was fairly easy, but what a waste of time. I won't order from this vendor again."	0
"Well, the need that me and my wife have in reference to a cell phone, it is just what we need. My vehicle excepts blue tooth and the phone locks on every time and works great."	1
Went back to Blackberry Had a Samsung 4 it died then they gave me a 5. Hate the touch screen . at 79 and have had Blackberrys for many years could not adjust . Thank you for having it for sale	1

"What an awful seller.  I bought a PDA cell phone from them that they advertised as New and never used.  When I received it, it would not even turn on.  I have sent messages to them asking for a remedy and they have not as much as responded (at all).  I recommend that if you do not want to get ripped off, stay away from this seller."	0
what carrier is this phone 	0
What happen whit the cellphone???????	0
What I ordered did not come I fit something completely different than was advertised.DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER. 	0
"What more can be said? Its a great phone! The ONLY con to it is the video on it is quite sketchy and laggy but the rest is amazing! If you&apos;re thinking about buying it, do it.    Hunter"	1
"What&apos;s not to like? I already had this phone but needed to replace it. And I wanted to stick to the same phone. Why? It&apos;s an MP3 player, radio, camera, email access, instant message and it fits comfortably in my front pocket and jacket pocket. Not bulky."	1
When first receiving the phone that day the screen completely froze while playing music (still does constantly everyday). Hard to text or type anything because the sensor aren't functioning correctly; also the date & time settings is keep popping up everytime i'm using the phone. I advise this product is a poor purchase to anyone who buys.	0
when i bid on this i was looking for a fliptop phone but this was nice looking and had a camera which i definitely needed for 2 girls that change every day but i won it and i paid it right away because that is good business procedures-right away the seller wrote me saying it would be going out soon and which it did the seller shipped right away and then the mailman brought it to the door and it was so light when i took it out but it was a good description of what the phone was supposed to look like and no scratches or anything wrong with it- it charged right away and i love it the phone is so easy to use and i love taking pictures of the girls with it and it is so light its not one of those big bulky phones and it is a great phone for anyone and comes with everything you would want for it.	1
"When I bought the phone it said used in fair conditions, when I got it had a broken screen and it had a mistreated use. My feedback was neutral and the seller called me with a very bad attitude yelling at me because I did not contact him on the issue the phone was less than the shipping and handling  THIS SELLER IS ONE OF THOSESELLER WHO LIKES TO TRICK COSTUMER BE CAREFULL WHILE BUYIG SOMETHING FROM HIM!!!!!!!"	0
When i contact sprint the original. Phone is white but this one is black i am very dissapointed 	0
"When I first purchased this phone it worked fine, shortly afterward, it began cutting off and saying there was no SIM card after charging.  I thought it was the SIM card but found out the SIM card was working just fine, it was the phone that was defective and the seller refused to give me a refund or exchange it for another phone!  I am very disappointed and will never buy another phone from E-Bay again!"	0
When I got the item it was just what you said in the add and shipped out on time and received fast   thanks	1
"when i had bought the phone i was told it was new , but the phone was not new is had files deleted that were suppose to have been in the phone and it had pictures of some woman in the phone. the phone will delete my contact dose not show me who called when i recived a miss call."	0
When i purchased that phone galaxy j3 the seller didn't show everything i read the descriptions he didn't not put all the descriptions the phone galaxy j3 have too many scratches on it  it's too expensive for that price	0
"When I receive the item it shows several times that most of the applications stop working, have to take the device to a technician the restore the system to defaults but after this it shows that several application stop working, so the technician have to upload an stock firmware and now it start working normally but have to pay 50 dollars for this almost the cost of the phone"	0
"When I received the package it was empty and had been stamped by the post office &quot;Package Received Empty&quot;.  When I contacted the seller she was unwilling to refund my money.  I contacted Ebay and receieved no help from them either, so I am now out $110.00 and still have no phone!"	0
"When I received the phone it immediately started to randomly reboot.  These random reboots were not disclosed on the ebay listing.  After multiple troubleshooting attempts over a couple of weeks, based on google searches of thevproblem, with no results,  it eventually would not even turn on.  When I brought the phone to a repair shop they stated it was not repairable. So, in essence I was sold a lemon."	0
"when i recive the phobe it was not unlocked how they said , but i send some emails and they call me , but i still dont recive the unlock code to unlocked the phone,  now i have the phone and i have ti paid 13 dollars extra for something that must not be my problem because i paid for a unlocked phone   i hope some body can help me"	0
When I try to add phone to my account it tells me: This device cannot be added to your account.  Please make sure it is not associated with a different account.  Is this usual with a refurbished phone?  	0
When I won he txted me and said sorry man can't send it to you which is funny because I live in the state next to him and his reasoning was I did not pay within 2 minutes of the win. Don't buy it's a scammer 	0
"When my son moved out of the country, my husband, who had never had a cell phone, took over our son&apos;s cell phone contract, but we needed to get him a different phone.  I specifically looked for this Nokia because of the success I enjoyed with my own for two years. It is a workhorse of a cell phone -- the one Alltel sent out with their field workers because it is the sturdiest -- but most importantly because it has the most reliable service in the most remotest of areas (we live out in the boonies).      No frills, but no nonsense."	1
"When this device works it's awesome. That is as long as you can keep it working. Mine worked about 3-4 days. Then would either reboot and loose everything or not even turn on. The battery would say it was almost charged around 80%, but would die within the hour. Now that being said, when it did work it was very fast, took great pictures and handled nicely. "	0
"When we purchased a phone from this seller, he had a deal that if you left feedback BEFORE flashing the phone, he&apos;d flash the phone for you for FREE. Huge bold print about the generous deal, so we left positive feedback because the item came looking brand new and was shipped quickly. After the phone was flashed however, we experienced problems IMMEDIATELY. The phone never functioned correctly and the Motorola emblem on the back fell off the next day for no reason at all. Contact between us and the seller was extremely poor. We felt sure we were being given the run around in hopes that the 30 day exchange policy would expire. Also, we&apos;d already given positive feedback, so how we were treated by the seller really didn&apos;t matter, no one on Ebay would know. We had to open a case with Ebay in order for the seller to respond to our problems with his faulty product. At that point he responded quicker than ever, assumably because he was looking out for himself and his Ebay account, NOT US, the consumer.  I strongly recommend that you FULLY EXPLORE your item and ensure proper function before leaving positive feedback for this seller. I&apos;m wondering how many positive feedbacks were given before consumers found that they would NOT have left positive feedback had they not been inticed to leave it before fully exploring any items bought from this seller.    So here&apos;s my ammended feedback:    NEGATIVE: would not recommend, item not as described, poor communication, had to open Ebay case."	0
"When you looked at the product specs, it seemed to be a match made in heaven. True reality is quite opposite. I purchased this roughly two months ago and it had worked quite well. I am not a smartphone savvy so I don&apos;t mess up with configurations, ROMs or anything in relation to complex SW and HW topics, however I do trust in the system updates that are pushed and installed automatically and this has been my behavior with previous phone purchases. To my surprise and having really not much information about it, my phone updated to Android 4.2.2 with HTC Sense 5.0 automatically. After the installation was done it worked fine for a few days and again asked for software update on the transfer files feature which it did automatically. After this took place, the phone lost the ability to recognize if there is a sim card inside or not and because of this it stopped working a phone and became a paper weight that now sits on my desk. I reached out to the vendor and through a number of communications was not able to get any help at all. As a matter of fact, even after explaining I had little to no knowledge on smartphones, vendor asked ME to flash the rom!! This was the warranty they were offering me on the product... when I asked &quot;how do I do that&quot; they stated they were sales reps and could help me and that I should seek help through online forums on how to get this. Ridiculous... I asked to return the phone to get a refund, and again was denied of that too. The experience with phone and the seller has been the worst I have had through my purchases with Ebay. I don&apos;t recommend this product and be very careful on who you buy it from as warranty seems to serve the seller&apos;s needs and not the customer&apos;s."	0

"While everyone else was busy trying to keep up with iPhone, Apple were busy creating amazing new features that make iPhone more powerful, easier to use, and more indispensable than ever. The result is iPhone 4. The biggest thing to happen to iPhone since iPhone. All the breakthrough technology in iPhone 4 is situated between two glossy panels of aluminosilicate glass - the same type of glass used in the windshields of helicopters and high-speed trains. Chemically strengthened to be 20 times stiffer and 30 times harder than plastic, the glass is ultradurable and more scratch resistant than ever. It&apos;s also recyclable. The 960-by-640 backlit LCD display boasts a pixel density of 326 pixels per inch, making it the highest-resolution phone screen ever. To achieve this, Apple engineers developed pixels so small - a mere 78 micrometers across - that the human eye can&apos;t distinguish individual pixels. That makes text remarkably sharp and graphics incredibly vivid. IPS technology also provides excellent color and contrast from almost any viewing angle. Created from Apple&apos;s own alloy, then forged to be five times stronger than standard steel, the CNC-machined band is the mounting point for all the components of iPhone 4. The band provides impressive structural rigidity and allows for its incredibly thin, refined design. It also functions as both iPhone 4 antennas. Apple engineers designed the A4 chip to be a remarkably powerful yet remarkably power-efficient mobile processor. With it, iPhone 4 can easily perform complex jobs such as multitasking, editing video, and placing FaceTime calls. All while maximizing battery life. iPhone 4 includes a built-in three-axis gyroscope. When paired with the accelerometer, it makes iPhone 4 capable of advanced motion sensing such as user acceleration, full 3D attitude, and rotation rate. Translation: More motion gestures and greater precision for an even better gaming experience. The iPhone 4 camera shoots gorgeous 5-megapixel photos and stunning HD video. And with its advanced backside illumination sensor, it captures beautiful images even in low-light settings. The built-in LED flash does double duty. When you&apos;re taking pictures, it works as a flash. When you&apos;re shooting video it can stay on to light up the scene. And on the front of iPhone 4, the built-in camera is perfect for making FaceTime calls and shooting self-portraits. While most phones have only one microphone, iPhone 4 has two. The main mic, located on the bottom next to the dock connector, is for phone calls, voice commands, and memos. The second mic, built into the top near the headphone jack, is for FaceTime calls and for making your phone calls better. It works with the main mic to suppress unwanted and distracting background sounds, such as music and loud conversations. This dual-mic noise suppression helps make every conversation a quiet one. With its large Multi-Touch display and innovative software, iPhone lets you control everything using just your fingers. How does it work? A panel laminated on the glass senses your touch using electrical fields. It can register multiple touches at once to support advanced gestures such as pinch to zoom, two-finger tap, and more. The panel then transmits the information to the Retina display below it."	1
"While specs are lower than those of top phones, performance is on par. Nice design. Excellent value."	1
"While this phone has many nice features, it is set up to only allow 25 entries in the calendar!!  My old phone whould take 500!! and I used over 300 so this Motorola phone was unacceptable.  The only way I found out about the 25 entry limit was to buy the phone, try it and then call tech support to find out that there is no way to change the limit.  I got the phone because my old LG would go into the browser when trying to unlock the keyboard which used my minutes and was quite frustrating.  The Motorola was easy to lock and unlock."	0
Whoever owned this phone didn't cancel their account and the phone is unusable. I wish I had of know this before hand. What a scam!	0
why I see a picture of S9 but information about phone is different.. and seller never has respond on my question..(bad communication with customers)	0

"Wish i had purchased the 32gb storage, but 16gb will have to do. I changed from a Galaxy note 4 to this and find them very similar. The battery life is better thought and it's a larger screen. Love it so far."	1
"With only one exception, I have been buying Nokia phones over the last 10 years. This phone has everything one can wish for.   Much more features than an iPhone, comparable quality, for less than half the price. It is even much less expensive than Android phones, which don&apos;t reach the level of functionality and are light years from Nokia&apos;s product quality.  I wished Symbian^3 would have the same popularity as Android, which would lead to much more apps. Too bad that Maemo doesn&apos;t run on this machine."	1
With unbreakable screen and back . A great value	1
"Without a doubt a great salesman, delivers what is described and does not lie in the descriptions, I have had good communication and has been very helpful in answering all my questions"	1
"Won the item, was hoping to get the item soon. The seller made an excuse, then the guy refunded me, then I found that the item was re-listed. Probably wanted more than what I bought it for. Will not buy from him again."	0

"Worked for two days.  Then on a Friday night while watching TV for hours I noticed that it had not been updated so I began working through the update menus.  When it came time to update the Android software the phone began looping and restarting over and over again.  Tried all the remedies on the internet with no results.  The phone kept restarting.  Reinstated my old phone, deactivated this S7 edge and returned it and received a prompt refund of the full amount.  Never again will I buy ""refurbihed"".  "	0
Worked perfect at first. Now I see myself having to take the battery out the phone 5 or 6 times a day due to freezing. A friend of mine has the same company but different phone and her phone did the same thing. Its an ok phone.	0

"Works flawlessly,  not a single scratch or imperfection on it, great battery life. It was described as new mint condition...if I didn't know it was used I would have thought it was brand new. Arrived within 3 or 4 days. This seller gave an honest description of the product, shipped quickly etc. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED SELLER.

"Wow, I must say you guys have some nerve to ask for a review on this ITEM!! YOU guys took the seller side... clearly u can check my buying history for this phone, lol and u will see that the seller has a ALL SHARE CAST HUB as the cell phone. WRONG DESCRIPTION ONCE AGAIN. HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. I WILL NEVER BUY ELECTRONICS ON EBAY. THE SELLER was able to keep my hard earned 72.00!! I even shipped the device back. I must say eBay u don&apos;t have my trust any longer. U made a decision that was not logically. You must show &quot;love&quot; to your buyers too. Not just the sellers. This experience... i was better off going to brandsmart. I feel like i was begging for my Refund back. Snakes....So eBay if this review is actually reviewed. U will see the sellers was w r o n g! No electronics will ever be bought by me here. Be careful. You have no clue who your buying from. Will it be the right description? What if its not. Will you get your money back.. probably not. Not worth it."	0

Love the phone. Gets great signal if you're on T-Mobile. Speakers sound great and screen looks gorgeous. There arent a lot of roms availavle for this version and in just now starting to try gcam apks that havent crashed. In coning from a phone with 32gb internal and bad speakers so I'm in love with thia phone. Make sure to get a cse becauae a durabolity video showed that it soes break from a 3 foot fall	1
"Love the phone. Great feel and size, takes quality pix, easy to use, voice controls anything you ask of her.  At this price for this much memory you cannot go wrong!"	1

"Love the screen size. It's perfect! Much better than any Android phone, including the S8. Get an iPhone! You won't regret it. "	1
"Love the side edge, gives you quick access without losing your screen. "	1
love the size love the screen great cell dont like the keyboard to small for my fat fingers but hey texting is elleagle while driving in mass now ha ha ha	1
Love the sleek design.  Easy layout of keys and easy to navigate through menus.  Camera is better than most other flip cell phones.    Would buy again.	1
love the style of phone and price but found that I could not use it in my area. they did not list this phone on the tracfone site so I wasn&apos;t able to check to see if it was compatible in this area. Didn&apos;t find out until I tried to transfer number from one phone to the other and was unable to.	1
"Love the styling and the simplicity. I&apos;ve had one of these a few years ago and regretted selling it. It might not have a camera and flashy features, bit it is way cooler than anything around at the momen, it&apos;s the right size and it does the job!! I can&apos;t say anything negative about it at all!!"	1
"Love the thin design, huge internal space, as well as dual SIM. Camera takes beautiful pics. My favorite phone thus so far. Would definitely recommend to friends and family."	1
"Love the touch screen, size, quaulity phone Never had a problem with this phone and the camera is one of the best, Love that you can give commands and get response and that its a smart phone so when my phone was stole I replaced it with this same phone and they were able in just minutes download all my numbers to this phone that made my day in every way."	1
"Love the touch screen,great features.Best phone I&apos;ve ever owned hands down.  Bought because I broke the screen on my other rumor touch.  Nothing that I&apos;ve found to dislike about it.Great battery life also."	1
Love the unlimited photo storage with Google. Smooth navigation with nice now playing for music. 	1
"Love the usb-c charging cable, you don't have to insert one way, fits up or down not just one way"	1
"Love the way it looks. Everyone stops me to ask where did I get it. Very nice phone, I would buy it again no hesitation. It looks so much bigger in the pictures, I was surprised of its size when I got it home, I expected it to be big but no. GREAT phone."	1
love these little phones..even though ATT no longer sells them or the proper holster....battery last good...very durable....camera leaves a little to be desired.....glad these are readily available on e-bay...i have 2 for spares and would buy another when needed....ty	1
"Love this design of Sony! The phone looks nice and performs fast. The battery easily lasts more than a day. The sound is really good and loud from its dual speakers. IP68, Quick Charge 3.0.  The phone has both: The type-C port and the Headphone jack too, which makes it even greater!"	1
Love this flip phone.  I upgraded to a more modern style and went back to this after a few months.  This is so lightweight it doesn't weigh my purse down and can fit into any pocket nicely.  Long lasting battery and nice and clear to talk on.  Easy to use.	1
Love this iPhone better than any other one I've ever had and have been an apple customer for years. 	1
Love this iphone! the sound quality and the voice quality is great. It has a long battery life. Looks beautiful and does all that i expect from an iphone 8 plus. You cant run out of storage with 256g. Very happy with this purchase. 	1
Love this iPhone!!! 	1
LOVE THIS ITEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	1
Love this item. Wonderful phone.	1
Love this phone  	1
Love this phone - I may be old school but I appreciate the dependability and longevity - don't need a new improved version every time something comes out.  If it aint broke don't fix (or change) it.  I have had this phone since 2004 (when Cingular was still around) - It is still working but like myself is beginning to show it's age  I get teased a lot but I LOVE this phone and as long as I can find one out there still working I will continue to have this model phone -  thank you eBay :)	1
love this phone  it holds a video card for extra space   great deal  good buy  great response time  all around i am happy with service	1
Love this phone - it is beyond my wildest dreams - everything you could ever want in a phone and more.	1
"Love this phone , my daughter is gonna flip out over this phone it was brand new nothing wrong with it!!! Great seller!!!"	1
love this phone although I was unable to use it on my contract carrier I used wifi Line Vox Youtube and numerous other wifi accessable sites.	1

"Love this phone excellent tool for texting this was my first experience on ebay &amp; it was definately a good one, I will be back. As a matter of fact I&apos;m actually thinking about buying the same phone when its time for my contract renewal. As for the man I purchased it from would buy from him in a heartbeat if he&apos;s got any more things to sell let me know, kidding. thank you windycity madmen you just made this lil lady happy woman!!!! Missi"	1
Love this phone for a simple call and text phone...Seller was great with fast shipping . Phone was in great shape. Description was accurate.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................	1
Love this phone got it because of the ruggedness and love flip phones. Good camera good sound. only thing i don&apos;t like is there is no way to silence call when phone is closed. But a great phone for the price. especially good for someone in the construction business where phones take a beating.	1
love this phone its fast the browser is fast and you cant beat a flip smart phone overall a great buy!!!	1
Love this phone its great.	1
Love this phone iv'e had lots of phones but None like this one.	1
Love this phone my Doughter was so happy thanks man or mam  	1
Love this phone so far  	1
love this phone the screen is amazing the windows phone 8.1 Is smooth the apps are getting better which just adds to the value	1
Love this phone the track pad much better than ball faster wifi is the works free brousing the web whrn credit low.It small enough to fit in your pocket	1
Love this phone very nice this is my second one and would recommend it to anybody    A+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++	1
"Love this phone!  Bought it because my old phone was worse than obsolete at greater than 2 1/2 years old.  I love the size, shape and contour of this phone.  It actually feels good to hold in your hand.  Most new top of line smartphones are way too large to fit comfortably in your pocket. Would definitely buy again.  Only thing I don&apos;t like is like most new phone models now there is no micro-SD slot to add memory. Also not happy that Google recently sold Motorola to Lenovo a chinese company.  Glad that my phone was manufactured in USA."	1
"Love this phone!  Having lots of fun tweaking it to my use. It is different than the old razr but so nice. Slim, shiny and attractive.  This ebay seller is sosoo  nice. They are there 24 hrs a day and are helpful and so polite. Much better than the american ebay sellers!!! They ship quickly and I have never had a problem with the shipping. Only one phone out of the many I have ordered for friends and family has had a problem and they fixed it immediately by sending a new phone...in fact they sent the new one before they received the broken one!  Great people to shop with.   The shipping is only about 14 days to the USA...honestly that is as fast as some who ship from the US to the US.    I am very pleased with the price, seller and phone."	1
Love this phone!  Takes a nice picture and has great color.  The pink is just a great shade.  Every girl or guy could carry with just about anything.	1

"Love this phone!  Thanks to a very knowledgeable seller who got me the right product for what network is available here in Canada and offered after-care, warranty, etc.  Very, very happy with my eBaying experience!"	1
"Love this phone!  The only issue I have is the volume, it is not as loud as others but putting in my earbuds solves that problem, great value and tons of really cool cases for it.  Nice screen, easy to use.  Thanks eBay!"	1
"Love this phone!  Works great, love the size and the look."	1
"Love this phone! Easy to use, has two settings easy and advanced mode, for those of us less tech savy. Even with all the texting I do, up to 50-60 per day, the battery stays charged at least two days.  You can magnify the text for larger print, easy to see, even without my glasses on.  Excellent sound quality. It is a bit heavy if you carry it around it your pocket like my kids do, but for me it&apos;s not a issue.  Totally pleased with all the features of this phone, I would highly recommend it."	1
Love this phone! Great battery life. Great apps. 	1
"Love this phone! great reception and battery life-love the slide out keyboard. Using the internet is a little clunky, but hey! This isn&apos;t a smartphone..."	1
"Love this phone! It has so many features that work well. Takes great pics. The only negative, if you can call it that,  is that I HAVE to charge it overnight or it won&apos;t have enough battery for the next day. Overall, I can&apos;t say enough good things about it."	1
Love this phone! It lasts because of the steel casing. The only phone that I like that doesn&apos;t require a data plan with Verizon. Can only find them on ebay!	1
"Love this phone! Just purchased another one for my husband for Christmas.  If you love your razor you&apos;ll love this slimmer version of the same.  Easy to use.  Takes great pictures and is easy to thumb through.  Sleek look with a glass front.  Fits nicely in pocket.  Also  when turned up is easy to hear even if in your purse. Unlike my last two phones its loud and clear.  You can also buy the cable and download tunes for ring tones.  I can&apos;t think of any downfalls yet except for the glass front is easily cracked. Buy a cover for this baby, treat it well and it will reward you with great service! Hope this helps you decide.  Desi"	1
Love this phone! Replaced my blackberry and now I actually use the data plan I pay for! I have owned so many smartphones and while this one isn&apos;t the smartest it is the most usable based on its speed and ease of use.	1
"Love this phone! So used to Samsung Galaxys but satisfied I made the switch. Only features this phone doesn't have is NFC (doesn't matter, no stores have tap pay anyway in my area and I don't use my phone as currency), LED notifications (have to root to get that), and IR for use as a traditional TV remote. Small potatoes and for the price, I can live with that!"	1
Love this phone! The battery stays charged all day and I'm on it a lot!	1
"Love this phone! Used to have a DroidPro, but decided to try this out, and I&apos;m never going back! Great call quality, battery life, and doesn&apos;t seem to have the operating system bugs as any other phones I&apos;ve had."	1
"Love this phone! Very durable and even though it is somewhat simple in its style, it has lots of neat features, like a voice that says who&apos;s calling when the phone rings. It doesn&apos;t have a keyboard but texting is still simple enough. Well worth the money - too bad it is a discontinued style."	1
"Love this phone! Works great with Boost, downloadable applications, switch between applications easily, sync contacts with yahoo.  Has everything I could ask for in a phone."	1
Love this phone!! Easy to use. Battery life exceeded my expectations.  Surfing the web is fast and screen is large enough to see pages well.  Don&apos;t usually like touch screen for texting but Swype is awesome.  Speakerphone is very good to hear on.  Love the phone.	1
Love this phone!! Love all the features it has to offer:) Battery could be better but that&apos;s likely the case in used phones so no big deal there.	1
"Love this phone!!!  Missed the querty keyboard, this one has it!  Takes good pictures!  Havened had any problems downloading apps, alot of memory!  The battery life on this phone is great!  last 2days!!  Great android phone!!  Will use until something really SUPER BETTER comes along!!  Can do everything with this phone!"	1
"Love this phone!!! Easy to use, was in original settings like brand new, and has all the features you need!!! Instant use, no complications whatsoever and perfect size! Not too big or too small."	1
Love this phone!!! I broke out of the crackberry and have enjoyed the android phone.  Took a little time dealing with the many side effects of losing my blackberry :) but have fully recovered with this new phone.  Very fast phone love all that it can do!!	1
"Love this phone!!! It took much debate with boost to get a new sim, but i finally got it up and running with little to no problems..... Seller is great and the phone is like new with no scratches or blemishes whatsoever!!! Recommend this seller to anyone needing a new phone... Cause it is new... Thx!!"	1
"Love this phone!!!! It&apos;s super fast, easy to use once you get the hang of it... and once you get this phone, you&apos;ll never go back to anything else. 10/10!"	1
love this phone!!!!!!!!!!!!!super fast and user friendly.Had it with another company and changed to verizon and didn&apos;t truely realize how good it was till it was gone. Would pick it any day over an iPhone.	1
Love this phone!I needed a cell phone - not a smart phone and this is so much easier to use than my previous samsung phone.  It is easy to text with  and the call quality is good. I would recommend this phone to anyone who needs a easy to use phone for texting and calling.	1
"Love this phone, it is great!!! I would recommend this phone to anyone who wants a good slider.  Its very easy to operate."	1
"Love this phone, the battery lasts for a very long time. "	1
"Love this phone,It&apos;s easy to use and has everything I need.It scrolls easy and things are easy to find and to set up.It works with straight talk wich I have now and it hast great service."	1
"love this phone,nice feel to it. Its old school but its what I like."	1
Love this phone. 	1
love this phone.  it did take some getting used to.  it is like a mini computer afterall.... but it&apos;s a great phone.    no one can even tell I bought it used.  there were no scratches or signs of wear anywhere on it    if your looking for a do anything phone this IS IT!!!	1
"Love this phone.  When my old one died, I had to get the same phone because it has a huge qwerty and a nice big display.  Love Straight Talk and this phone works with that system.  Switched from bad phone to the good one in 5 minutes and it moved my contacts over and account info and all.  Great phone."	1
Love this phone. Although I'm still learning to work it. And the camera is the best. I did have to buy a charger that would charge the phone properly. But great phone! Thanks LG	1
LOVE THIS PHONE. Disable some of the battery guzzling functions and it really makes me not regret switching from the iPhone (primary reason is the physical keyboard). 	1
"love this phone. Easy to navigate. keys are easy. love the auto-lock mechanism.  Lg&apos;s have always been known for good sound and phone quality.  Nice, sleek."	1
Love this phone. Easy to use and works great for me...It looks and feel like new for a fraction of the price...	1
"Love this phone. Easy to use, great features.  HTC has outdone themselves with this phone.  It is the best android phone ever."	1
Love this phone. Fast and reliable.	1
Love this phone. Great buy!!!	1
Love this phone. Great feel in the hand and a great camera! I can see why they call it the pixel. 	1
Love this phone. Great phone for the price. The battery doesn&apos;t last over 8 hours even if all apps are closed. Overall a great phone and would recommend to my friends!	1
"Love this phone. I have had no issues. I've dropped it numerous times, no cracks. Perfect."	1
Love this phone. It was delivered quickly exactly as advertised. I would definitely recommend. Brand new still in original packaging with stickers and wrapped on the items in the box. This phone was unlocked. I am really happy with it so far and super pleased with this purchase.	1
Love this phone. The current price vs the performance and features makes it an excellent choice. 	1
"Love this phone. This is the second Huawei I have had, and will keep buying them in the future."	1
"Love this phone. Unfortunately one of ours fell into the dreaded boot loop and had to be replaced. I am not ready to upgrade though, because this is such a good device otherwise. "	1
Love this phone. Very clean .like brand new. Also functions like brand new. Definitely one of my better purchases	1
LOVE this phone. We had this phone before for a few years. Never a complaint about it. Our contract expired and Sprint offered a different model for 99 cents if we signed up for another 2 years. We did. The direct connect button on the new phone was very touchy and would disconnect the call before you had a chace to flip it open. We kept hanging up on customers. They said it was just that model. So I purchase this phone to replace the other new one. Still LOVE this phone.	1
"Love this phone... Great for texting,  super thin and light weight and the internet is REALLY FAST!  I was using an HTC TILT and before that the MOTO Q.  Liked the internet speed of the TILT,  but the phone was extremely complicated and SOOO HEAVY and BULKY.  The Q was way more user friendly but had the slowest internet I&apos;d ever used.  THE PANTECH SLATE is the best of both worlds!  Thinnest, Lightest QWERTY keyboard phone EVER,  with a very USER FRIENDLY MENU and LIGHTNING FAST INTERNET CONNECTION. I AM VERY VERY PLEASED WITH THIS PHONE!"	1
Love this phone.....so much features and so fast....Definitely recommend!!	1
Love this Product everything you could want in a cell phone!! I bought this item because of all the functions this phone has to offer. This is Great!	1
Love this product!  It was exactly as promised! Thank you!	1
"love this product, easy to use while texting.  love the pull out board and use of the phone,  unfortunately this particular one sold by the seller   was badly handled and damaged"	0
"love this product, speedy shipping extremely happy with my purchase needed a new phone this was right up my alley"	1
Love this purchase. Got this for my mom who needed bigger and clearer letters. She is so thankful for being able to see better.	1
"love to buy from you, items was in perfect condition love itlove to buy from you, items was in perfect condition love itlove to buy from you, items was in perfect condition love itlove to buy from you, items was in perfect condition love itlove to buy from you, items was in perfect condition love it"	1
"love what amazon has done for small devices...sorry the phone failed, but I benefited.  I treat it like a mini kindle, and the free prime was just in time.  lots of power, but I can see how heat and battery life will always be a challenge as devices get faster and smaller.  someone lost money on this phone, great deal."	1

"Love, love this phone.  I feel it one of the best cell phones I have purchased.  The battery life is great and the speed is fantastic.  Would highly recommend this phone."	1
"Love, love, love this phone.  Actually haven&apos;t used it for a phone but more like a mini computer MP3 player and to play games.  It connects online so you don&apos;t need the Phone contract if you have WiFi and just want to play the games on it.  We don&apos;t have a phone contract with it so we can&apos;t receive or place calls, but we have enjoyed using it for Music, Games and web browsing.  The only thing I could say that I don&apos;t like is that the speaker could be louder when listening, but it&apos;s actually quite good for it&apos;s size. :)"	1

"Love, Love, Love this phone.  Durable, easy to use, and larger qwerty keyboard for easy use.  I have had one for a few years with no problems whatsoever, and now a new one for my picky son.  He loves it just as much as I do."	1
"Love, love, love this phone. I do not use/want a smart as for my intents and purpose a basic flip phone is for me. I love the fact that it is wind, shock, and water proof and if I feel the need to get on the internet, I have that capability with a pay as you use deal. The one drawback, if you consider that a drawback is the camera doesnt take ""immediate"" shots. Once you clic to take the photo the camera/phone takes an additional 2 seconds to actually take the photo. I am not a photographer so no biggie. I had a Casio Gzone a while back and loved it and this phone is almost a clone of that one with better styling. Verizon wanted 49.99 for this phone plus 40.00 extra for hookup, and I would have to have agreed to a 2yr contract. I have been a loyal verizon customer for over 20 yrs and have never missed a bill and have not been on a contract for quite some time. I bought this phone that I wanted off ebay and it was less than what verizon was going to charge and no contract! No brainer. Thank you"	1
"Love,love,love this phone. Highly recommend it. The one draw back is it sucks battery when on the net .otherwise I love it."	1
"love: flip phone, small and slim,easy to use, consistent and long-term performance  like: decent battery life  dislike: ring tone options are stale  I bought this phone a few years back, got it wet, then used my husband&apos;s until I dropped it too much.  Finally got a new phone (different brand) and lost it.  When I decided to buy a new one, I already had a blackberry for work and wanted something small and reliable for a personal cell, so I went back to my RAZR and absolutely love it. I do tend to put my phones through the ringer and this one has always been true to me."	1
"Love: Size, style, functionality    Dislike: Camera is pretty marginal with low quality images. Battery seems to run down quickly and I have to charge it about every other day.     Actually, my first 5310 failed after about a year and wouldn&apos;t charge. The batt was OK, but the tiny charging connector became intermittent and finally failed completely so I had to buy a replacement unit."	1
Loved everything.    I bought the phone three weeks ago and was immediately impressed with it.  Best deal ever.  No complaints.	1
Loved it  works great 	1
Loved it at first worked fine for the first month then after that it started having problems my brother in law works for Samsung and he couldn't figure out what was going on with it 	0

"Loved it, great product, great price. Replaced broken one that AT&amp;T was going to charge $50 more. Thank you, .."	1
LOVED JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING ON PHONE.  THE ONLY THING I DID NOT LIKE WAS WHEN YOU SCROLLED ANYTHING YOU TOUCHED OPENED.  TRIED RESETTING TOUCH SETTING. NOTHING WORKED. BROKE PHONE IN HALF AND THREW IT OUT WHILE DRIVING. MAKES 2 LG PHONES I HAVE HAD THAT HAVE BEEN A P.O.S.	0
Loved my  phone.  Just  as  they said  it  would  be...   It  is  product  they  said  it  was.  We  love  it   I  don&apos;t  have  a bazillion  words  to  write.  .	1
Loved the full qwerty keyboard but couldn&apos;t download the latest Androd version. Sent the phone back for a refund.	0
"Loved the look of the phone and reception on my end was great.  However, people told me that when they talked to me on this phone I sounded &quot;far away&quot;.  I ended up returning it to the seller."	0

Loved the phone! It was on time and in perfect brand new condition! I would love to do business with you again! You always replied so fast to all my questions.      Thanks	1
"Loved the phone, but not the performance. Very short battery life, you can literally see the battery drain as you use it. Couldn't get even 4 hours of light use on single charge. Wouldn't upgrade to the new updated software version no matter how hard you try. Signal strength is mediocre at best, Display is great, LED notification is fantastic, sound qualiy is good, good feel and solid with no slip "	0
"Loved the product.  Wonderful experience.  Exactly what we wanted in a phone, and in great condition. Thank you so much"	1
Loved the size and color. Had a scratch across the back bottom. Wouldnt hold a charge. Was sent a battery. Replaced it and found out the battery in the phone was a replacement put in with the wrong screws. Phone still wont hold a charge. Not apple products used. Gets very hot when charging. Have to leave it plugged in so I can accomplish what I need to. Very disappointed. Paid $30.00 to have the battery put in.  I should get that back because it still wont hold a charge. Its going back as soon as I get something as I do not have a land line. 	0
Loved this phone like all the other Galaxy phones I have had through he years !!	1
"Loveing this phone, the hearing is great the sound is great pictures small but they are even great,you can see the pictures  clearly.."	1
"Lovely big screen and thin. As sold, this comes with Windows Mobile 6.5, which is so so. But thanks to people much clever than I, it&apos;s pretty simple to load Android onto it and turn this phone into more or less the Desire HD. Android can be dual booted with Windows Mobile or loaded directly onto the phone (in NAND is the techy term). Even better, once you&apos;re loading Andorid onto it, there are loads of version to choose from and you can get the very latest versions of Android. No waiting for the phone company to release an upgrade, which is a lot of cases they never do because they&apos;d rather you bought a whole new phone. So it&apos;s eco and wallet friendly ;)"	1
lovely phone.you can use forever.THE COVER IS MADE OF RUBBER WHICH MAKES IT MORE DURABLE.USE IT AND PASS IT ON TO YOUR GRAND CHILDREN	1
Lovely physical structure. Strong body. Great features and easy to use. Can easily fit into your pocket book. Have no doubt that it will last a very long time.  Good condition. And I must add that the delivery was extremely quick.  	1
loving how rugged this fone is. easy for me to open one-handed.	1
Loving it so far 	1
Loving it! Great camera ! S-pen is great for people with fingers not quite as dexterous as some. I love being able to jot down a note without even opening the phone. 	1

"Low price and pretty much new, I love this phone already!"	1
"low price for purchase, unlocked, alot of function, easy to txt msg, wifi network, email, skype software to use and others too, battery should stand for little longer max 3 days for me, but im havy users so its maybe not bad at all"	1
"lThis was by far my worst experience ever,,first it took the phone there weeks to make it being that it got lost In Miami first, finally receive the phone and I switched it to my straighttalk account, the phone works for 30  minutes,, no calls or texts could be made,,I find out through at&amp;t that the phone has been stolen and cannot be us the camera was aweful,, it completely sucked, notto mention I had to payb27 dollars to dens it back to China,, the phone finally made it now I still have to wait three says foe my refund,, worst example experience ever!!"	0
Luke the title said. Even worse i reached out to seller and nothing. Im a little sad.	0
"luv the phones, but this one was faulty and returned it with no problems."	1
Luv this phone! All the features of the S3 in the S2 size! Comes with less internal memory and is only 3G  capable. Those are the biggest draw backs. But it has the smart stay feature that I loved about the s3 and the size is perfect for smaller hands.  Also this phone supports up to a 64gb sd card so memory isn&apos;t really an issue. Love the navy blue color too. And you can&apos;t beat the price!  Great phone overall.	1
"Luv this phone! Was just about to click ""confirm & pay"" on a used Galaxy 8+, when I figured, ""let's do something different this time"". I haven't dove into every feature, BUT, everything is familiar if you're a current Android user. This is the first phone where I've actually used the fingerprint dilly-bob but it works like gangbusters & makes me wonder why I've never used it before. The screen is crisp, everything is super responsive, & it feels more premium than the price I paid for it. It's SUPER THIN...which, that may be be good or bad for you, but it makes me nervous since I'm a habitual screen cracker, due to putting my phones in my back pocket & then forgetting & sitting on em. I luv that the steps counter is just on, so if I turn the screen on, it's just there & it motivates me to take a quick walk around the neighborhood. Haven't tested video yet but the still camera handles low light a LOT better than I figured it would.   Cons: The super-pretty back of the phone is a fingerprint magnet, but if you plan to get a case...no worries there. There's a few nag notifications from Huawei. Surpised a few words weren't already pre-programmed into swype but type it once & it'll be there next time. Battery life is good, but not mind blowing. Volume isn't bad, but I've had better. Br"	1

"made in uk . factory unlocked. great quality. battery life is mediocre cuz they release these phone back in 2006. i hope the seller put the battery door in . not on the outside cuz if it slightly bent, the door is hard to put in not a good fit. signal strenght is about 87% optimal ."	1

Maravilhoso smartphones obrigado 	1
May have to complain if battery keeps going dead on me	1
"Maybe because this one was previous owner but it was false contact, the battery do not hold charge. this one was unlocked but you have pay for activate with your phone provider because this is micro SD inside and you can&apos;t just switch SD cards.  The seler do not respond me, or take many days to respond my e-mails."	0
"Maybe it was just our unit, but this phone just seemed to have a lot of glitches and very poor battery life for it&apos;s size in comparison to higher end phones."	0
"Maybe it was my mistake, but I expected this to be a working phone.  I realize with the world &quot;parts&quot; in the title that may have been naive, but the phone came with a non-campatible charger and various other broken bits and bobs.  Nothing useable."	0
"Maybe phone is good, but the Seller sent me a fake. And very poor quality. Phone stinks. Gold plating is very weak. I&apos;m not satisfied. Tried to contact the Seller to discuss a refund, so he does not reply to me."	0
Maybe the last phone I'll get for awhile. LG and Moto are all in with Mods and all other phones are uninnovative so waiting to be impressed as much as I am with Moto X Force.	1

"Mein altes Handy war kaputt und da ich bereits immer die Marke Nokia hatte, ist mir die Entscheidung nicht schwer gefallen. Einwandfreies Ger�t, kann ich nur weiterempfehlen."	1
"Meine Haupt Anforderungen waren:  - Bedienerfreundlich  - Farbdisplay  - Preis unter 40 �  - Kein Klapp- oder Schiebehandy  - Prepaid    Nach Beratung bin ich auf das Nokia 2310 gesto�en. Dieses Handy habe ich f�r 20 � erworben.  Bedienerfreundlichkeit  -----------------------------  Da ich bisher nur Siemens, Sony oder T-Mobile Handys hatte, war ich tats�chlich �berrascht wie schnell ich das Nokia Handy bedienen konnte.  Das Handy hat viele &quot;Standart&quot;-Funktionen, die �berlegt und ausgefeilt sind (im Vergleich siehe mein Erfahrungsbereich �ber den MDA 3) z.B. ist eine Kostenfunktion dabei, oder sinnvolle &quot;Anrufe in Abwesenheitsnotiz&quot; dabei. Das Men� ist klar strukturiert.  Weiterhin l�sst es sich auf die Bed�rfnisse des Nutzers einstellen bzgl. Farben und T�ne. Farben und T�ne sind sehr umfangreich und auch sehr sch�n!  Das Handy ist auch sehr leicht.    Mit der Ton- und Empfangsqualit�t bin ich sehr zufrieden. Der Gespr�chspartner ist gut zu verstehen und auch der Gespr�chspartner kann mich gut h�ren.  SMS  -------  Mit der SMS-Funktion bin ich auch sehr zufrieden. Muss mich allerdings noch umgew�hnen, dass das Leerzeichen auf der 0 und nicht auf der 1 ist und die Sonderzeichen links unten und nicht auf der 0 ;)    Signalmitteilungen  -----------------------  Was mir auch sehr positiv aufgefallen ist, das man soviel T�ne einstellen kann. Man kann auch Vibration in verschiedenen Varianten einstellen und auch nur Lichtsignale (kannte ich bisher noch nicht).  Radio  ------  Wo ich noch ein paar Worte verlieren m�chte ist das Radio. Das Handy hat ein integriertes Radio. Gespannt auf deren Zuverl�ssigkeit und gro�e Zweifel habe ich die Probe gemacht: Und tats�chlich das Radio hat eine erstaunlich gute Qualit�t was Empfang und Ton angeht!    Das Handy ist f�r Handy-Einsteiger hervorragend geeignet in unserer modernen Zeit. Es ist gut bedienerfreundlich und alle Funktionen des Handys sind ausgereift. Die Funktionen sind auf ein Minimum reduziert was man wirklich ben�tigt, deshalb ist auch kein Foto, E-Mail usw. dabei. (ausgenommen Radio)  Ich kann dieses Handy jeden Empfehlen."	1

"Metro PCS is a great company if you live in a large metropolitan area and do not travel cross country much. Some time ago, I signed up for an unlimited talk/text plan and received a Huawei M635. While it is certainly no smart phone, it does have the ability, with an added mini sd card, to download your own music for custom ring tones. Easy to use and great talk time; nearly 4 hours. It has a large view screen that makes reading texts a breeze and the chat mode is a definite plus. I&apos;ve ruined a few at the lake and like new models here on eBay are dirt cheap. Difficult to beat for the money IMO."	1

"Microsoft hopes its Windows Phone 7 smartphones will allow it to reclaim market share in a mobile space currently dominated by the likes of Google Android and the Apple iPhone. In order to accomplish that goal, the company has teamed with manufacturing partners to produce a series of smartphones whose large touch screens and minimal buttons are heavily reminiscent of the iPhone or Droid X. But how does one of those flagship Windows Phone 7 devices, the HTC HD7, compare to those bestselling rivals? Windows Phone 7 is largely free of glitches, despite lacking certain key features such as cut-and-paste (expected in January), but it still feels like a first-generation operating system in need of a few tweaks and add-ons. The hardware is handsomely constructed, with no glaring errors. In short, the HTC HD7 is a device that most people would be happy to ownand yet nothing about the smartphone stands out in a way that would necessarily drive someone to purchase it in place of a similar Apple or Android device."	1
"Microsoft invented the SmartPhone with PocketPC Phone Edition, and up until Windows Mobile 6.5, it was the most powerful, easy to use, and functional system.  It fully integrated with Outlook and Exchange.  Then, as usual, Apple dumbed everything down to a useless level popularized the Smartphone, stealing the market share and developer base from a product that remains today the best of its kind.    So Microsoft decided it needed to imitate the idiocy.  Windows Phone is an iPhone without apps, because they require a $99 developer fee just to be able to browse its contents.  It has to integrate with Windows Live SkyDrive or sync with Zune, just as iPhone integrates with iCloud or syncs with iTunes.  One would imagine Microsoft would keep their phone systems compatible with Outlook &amp; Exchange.  Not so much.  Exchange support for Windows Phone is identical to that of iPhone and Android.      Sadly, although I find Android lacking, it&apos;s the only option now for a fully featured Smartphone that isn&apos;t enslaved to a corporate notion or how you should be allowed use your phone."	0

"MOTOROLA V9 IT IS THE BEST MOBILE PHONE EVER,I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  IF SOMEBODY WILLASK ME -WOULD YOU LIKE TO BUY THIS MOBILE PHONE AGAIN-I WILL SAY YES ON A 100% NO PROBLEM I LOVE THIS CELL PHONE."	1

"Moved from an iPhone 6 to this, and really like the Windows 10 environment. Everything works better! Battery life, cell signal, Cortona smokes Siri, Excellent free maps program that can be installed on drive so no wasted data, been dropped several times with no case, and still looks new! "	1
"moved from iphone.  was loaded with galaxy and google bloatware, but after researching and disabling the guilty apps, the pop up ads  are gone and the speed is up!  google and samsung are stupid for selling phones slowed down by annoying advertising. but rectified with a week's worth of reading and playing around.  steep learning curve, but very customizable. once rooted it should be even better at adblocking and tracker blocking. note that only exynos can be rooted, so i'm lucky i choose that!  the amoled screen with blue light filter is a real pleasure to look at. the blacks are deep and saves battery too!  wireless charging is amazing, but doesn't charge well with cheap chinese chargers. spend the cash, do it right, buy samsung chargers for samsung products.  takes some time to learn the ropes, but well worth it.  excellent smartphone."	1
Movies are not recorded properly. Instructions on various operating modes are absent. Keeps changing applications without prompts. No icon for recording sound when taking movies.	0
Moving forward in the near future I will be using this buyer again. I must say I really enjoy my new phone thank you.  It came with all the Accessories.	1
"Moving from an HTC ONE to this S6.  A quick visit to the local T-Mobile store so they could cut the SIM to fit the Nano SIM size, adjust a couple of APN settings and the phone was ready to go!  Also purchased an Otterbox to add to an already rugged phone (teenager uses it).  Excellent in all ways!"	1
"mpr� un Xperia Z en 2 pagos (junto al articulo 330707939807) por una suma de 560 dolares, el env�o a la Argentina tard� poco mas de 2 semanas en llegar, recibiendo el tel�fono a finales de septiembre. A mitad de octubre, con menos de un mes de uso, el tel�fono empez� a fallar y dej� de funcionar. Me puse en contacto con el vendedor, ya que en la publicaci�n ofrecen un a�o de garant�a, tras muchos intentos de comunicarme y solo obteniendo como respuesta que haga un &quot;hard reset&quot; al tel�fono, lo cual no sirvi� de nada, abr� un caso en paypal para resolver el conflicto y llegar a una soluci�n, ya sea que me den un tel�fono que si funcione o me devuelvan el dinero. Ahora veo que el caso est� cerrado, sin dar ninguna respuesta ni soluci�n a mi problema, he gastado 560 dolares en un tel�fono que no funciona y con una garant�a que no cumplen."	0

"Much faster than the phone I am replacing (Alcatel Fierce One Touch). Bigger and clearer screen. Downside, I am not able to add SD card. IIRC, next level up (LG3) has slots for SD cards, and may be worth the additional expense."	1
"much greater upgrade from the iPhone 3g, everything is an improvement the wifi and ability to run multiple apps make this a great product, especially if you cant afford having data on your smart phone"	1
"Much to my disappointment this phone was not what I expected. To begin with, the battery doesn&apos;t function well, it turns off when it reaches 60%. Second of all I had to have the software changed within 2 months when my track pad didn&apos;t function anymore. furthermore the headset was fake. It was not a product of Blackberry and the button which you should press to answer the phone was glued to the headset. The back of the phone where the Blackberry symbol is is fake. And the phone cover is also fake because it peels off. I would certainly not buy one online anymore."	0

Me hace gracia ver compa�eros de trabajo con sus celulares pegados casi siempre al cargador mientras yo realmente wireless, fel�z y contento, todo ppr un precio imbatible.

The seller communicated well through-out the transaction. All-in-all, a good experience."	1

My buddy gave me his BT45TOY adapter that he used in his 05' Tundra (he installed a bluetooth supported deck) which I then installed in my 06' Tundra 2 years ago.

Works great in that vehicle as well.  	1

My Dad had this phone many years ago when it first came out and he LOVED it. Unfortunately he broke it and I&apos;ve been on the hunt for a BRAND NEW one for 2 years now. Finally I found it and I thought it was for a decent price. He doesn&apos;t like the new touch screen phones but he doesn&apos;t want a very old style flip phone either. I think that this phone is somewhat in between.	1
"My dad has been using this model phone for a while now and he loves!!! It doesn&apos;t have a lot of features than new phones do, but if you don&apos;t care, then this is a great phone!"	1
"My Dad is the type who, when he gets used to something and likes it, that is what he wants to use for now own. Dad got his first Nokia N95 around 5 years ago and told me, &quot;I have tried to get used to some of these newer phones, but they just don&apos;t feel right in my hands like my Nokia did when it was working&quot;, so I got on ebay trying to find one. Fortunately, I was lucky enough to find a Seller who had almost no experience, but ended up performing like a pro and got the phone my Dad has gotten so used to in brand new condition, just like it was advertised.    I do not personally have an opinion on this phone other than when somebody, like my Dad, gets used to a product, and they like the product, nothing else will work as good as they one they had to begin with. The phone is a nice little phone, but it would take some &quot;getting used to&quot; for me, personally, to be able to operate, but other than that, it&apos;s a great little product and Nokia should be proud of it.    On a more personal note, my Dad lives in Uzbekistan, so when he gets to the States, he puts in his &quot;United States Sim Card&quot; and when he gets back to his workplace, he puts in his &quot;Uzbekistan Sim Card&quot; and the phone performed flawlessly, through hundreds of flights in and out of Uzbekistan, with no problem whatsoever, so Nokia did make a winning product considering the phone lasted so long, through so many altitude and environmental changes, for a long 5 years before finally giving in to old age. 2 thumbs up on the Nokia N95 for anyone looking for a good, solid phone to last them for years without problems!"	1
My dad loves it!the old guy need a better phone n his old flip phone wasn&apos;t cutting the mustard.  So he tried it n loves the thing. Won&apos;t put it down.	1
My dad loves them for work	1
"My dad needed a new flip phone his,was falling apart so I found this one and it was perfect for him. It shipped faster than expected and was easy to switch the number over."	1

My daughter decided for me to buy that phone as a christmas present. It reached my house long after christmas with missing equipment and was not working at all. Had to send merchandise back to China which was very expensive and still have no refund. Would never buy from these people again.

This is her second one, she actually dropped her first one 9000 times before it finally gave up. If you&apos;re looking for something super durable, this is a great phone."	1

My daughter loves her new phone. I thought the price was worth it. She can do more things with this phone. She's upgrading from a windows phone so you get what you pay for.	1

My daughter loves the size and memory of this phone. Product arrived in a timely manner and was exactly as described. Price was a value and she is very happy with this purchase. 	1
My daughter loves this iphone. I would definitely buy from this seller again.  The iPhone arrived in excellent condition and arrived sooner than expected.  I am extremely satisfied.	1
My daughter loves this phone. High quality pictures. Easy access to keyboard with full keyboard. She absolutely loves that it fits into the coin pocket(small one inside most jeans front right pocket). She tried both the Samsung Intensity II and the LG Cosmos and begged me to get this phone for her again.	1
"My daughter loves this phone. Pretty color and all the basics included without all the garbage space hoarding apps. Phone has excellent battery life, bluetooth, wifi, 3.5mm headphone jack, and plenty of storage for contacts, photos, music, etc. Very difficult to find a simple bar phone these days, but this one is a keeper. Thank you virtual-depot!"	1

My daughter wanted a new phone. I decided to buy it mainly because it was reasonably priced. They shipped it in excellent time frame. Will most likely purchase from them again. Thank you!!	1
My daughter wanted this phone and absolutely loves it.  I wanted to surprise her with it and I did.  It works perfectly.  Great service.	1
"My daughter was absolutely in love with this phone - howevcer, I was unable to activate the phone for use!! A great dissapointment as the phone seemed to be more than adequate."	0
"My daughter was happy. The phone came exactly as described without flaws or scratches. Her new phone was stolen at the school so a used phone was a perfect replacement for her. Why sign up for another number when all you need is just the phone. Highly recommend others to buy from ebay, just don&amp;apos;t outbid me please."	1
My daughter&apos;s cell phone broke and she wanted this phone so I told her to go to e-bay so that it would be cheaper. It is a wonderful phone and works perfect. She is thrilled with it.  It is exactly as described by the seller. It rates a #1.	1
"My daughter&apos;s Nokia cell phone had a cracked casing and broken antenna. Upon recommendations from our cell phone service provider, we opted to buy a replacement phone off eBay rather than pay the $50 deductible from the service provider.  When I received the phone I was extremely disappointed.  The casing on this phone was also broken and to top it off, the battery was dead and would not charge, which forced us to purchase a new battery. I will never choose to buy a cell phone this way again.  I would have spent a lot less money just paying the deductible at the cell phone store."	0

"My dealing with this company so far has been they sell junk phone&apos;s.  I ordered one phone, delivered on time, but the phone wouldn&apos;t charge.  I advised the company that I had given my old phone away and now I had no phone and asked if they would overnight me a phone. It was there fault I had no phone.  They sent me another 7 days later and without a phone.  Now the second phone they sent me the speaker doesn;t work, and I can&apos;t tell when I&apos;m getting a call, so I STILL DON&apos;T HAVE A PHONE.  DON&apos;t WASTE YOU TIME OR MONEY WITH THIS COMPANY. PAY A LITTLE EXTRA AND GET A PHONE THAT WORKS!!!"	0

"My eleven year old son purchased this without checking with me or his dad. As soon as the order went through I tried to cancel it, but the seller said it had already shipped. I didnt get a shipping notification until the following day though. Now my eleven year old son is upset because he cant set it up without a SIM card. Hes pretty upset and so am I. The cancellation wouldve been nice especially since the phone didnt ship as fast as the seller said it did."	0
My employee got his phone wet. I had to have one fast and at a good price. I bought this phone and got it the next day. A great experience.	1
"My experience  Excellent seller everything arrived in excellent condition, fast, good communication with the seller and as is indicated I recommend it exceeded what I expected.  The only bad thing is the short battery life of this phone :(  "	1
My experience is that the phone I purchased has a cheap replacement battery; will not make or receive calls unless there is a data connection.  Unless perched within a block of a cell tower cannot get more than one bar displayed.  Contacted FreedomPop for tech support but was told they would only solve problem for a monthly fee.  A different model may work.	0
My experience was better than I thought it could&apos;ve been. I was hesitant to buy a phone on ebay. But I am happy to say that I have no regrets. The seller kept me updated from beginning to end. And it happened exactly the way the seller said it would and I received exactly what I was told I would.	1
"My experience with this phone is awful. I got this phone last Thursday May 16, 2013. The only thing I did on that day was to open the phone turn it on to see if it was working. It came on fine so I turned it off, took out the battery and went to do some research about the phone. I contacted the seller asking some questions which he could not answer and I did not want to use the phone unless it had an android OS 2.1 or higher. Anyway the seller instructed me to turn on the phone which I did, the phone kept on freezing and on Sunday May 19, 2013, less than a week, the phone froze and that was it. Up to this day I cannot get to use the phone and the seller is of no help. Less than a week and my money is blown. This is not good."	0
"my experience with this phone is, the jack for the headphone are not working properly and the battery is very pass do drain.and i add same apps on the phone be come slow."	0
"My experience with this phone its great, when you have already a phone with Windows Mobile, but if you have before a phone with Android, the sensation is rare because the interface in Lumia is clean, simple, and light.  Lumia 710 is very fast, excellent screen, very good on playing games, nice to watch videos, the music player is good.  This phone was designed to have internet connection all time, if do you want save files out, you must move files to Skydrive, or if you want move file to the phone, just copy files from Skydrive to phone.    Lumia 710 take nice pictures and is very easy share your moments in Facebook, because facebook connection is integrated in the system.  With applications you have thousand in the windows market place."	1
my experience with this phone was horrible it cuts on and off often for no reason i regret buying this phone from the seller serously!!!! Never Again	0
My experience with this seller and the product itself was excellent. I purchsed this phone because I broke mine and was in need of a new one. The seller was very accomodating and I recommend him as a seller. The phone is great and better than my original LG MytTouch (except the battery isn&apos;t as good). Overall I am very satisfied and enjoying the phone.	1
"My family bought three of these phones and we LOVE them! They can do anything a computer can do. My son, daughter-in-law and I are all very pleased with out phones. The only thing I&apos;ve found I can&apos;t do is play the Zynga games on Facebook. Other than that, I would buy these phones again. I recommend them to anyone who doesn&apos;t want to pay the price for a 4G."	1
My family has three of these phones the work great and they are good for all of our uses. User friendly. Every one of the phones we bought used on ebay and we are very satisfied.	1
My father is disabled thats why I purchased this phone. Be very careful when buying a blu joy phone it is T-Mobile. No directions very confusing. I had a professional phone company get it working to find out it wont work. Very disappointed a lot of wasted money and time	0
"My father purchased one of their iphones, only to have it come up as stolen/lost/fraud. Immediately requested our money back. Thank you for wasting our time and money. Crooks. "	0
My favorite iPhone ever. Still love these things even after the iPhone 7 is out. I have a 6 currently but always keep a 4S for a backup phone.	1
My fiance and I both have these phones and they are slow not much storage even with a memory card and hers is already broken. I don't recommend these phones	0
"My first alltel phone when I signed on in 2005. I got this and abused it a lot. It suffered many drops and even a little water damage and managed to work through all of that. it was one of the toughest phones i owned. nevermind any of the others i owned this was the best of alltel besides my rim blackberry.    by the end of the contract and eligible date the phone looked pretty bad and had glass pieces missing, decided it was the best ting to recycle and forget about it.    HONESTLY, this was very tough. I loved this phone but it was a little basic, so I wouldn&apos;t get it again, but If you need a good basic phone, I suggest this entirely."	1

"My first android phone.Upgraded from the Instinct.{Fan of the Samsung brand} I love it and can&apos;t see myself going back to a &quot;regular&quot; smartphone. Still learning about all the different apps that I can download.   The only negative things I have to say about the Moment is that it freezes every now and again &amp; its a little big but other than that, Love it."	1
My first BlackBerry since the 9900 and went to iPhone....much better than the iPhone! The seller was great....arrived in ONE day.  Thank you  	1
"My first ever smartphone was the LG G2, and I owned it for 3 years. I would have loved to continue using it, but it began to misbehave in ways that were difficult to live with. My husband purchased his LG G3 a year and a half ago. So, my debate was, do I purchase the newest LG G5, or do I purchased a new older version, mainly the LG G3. I read so many amazing reviews about this phone, so I decided to search for the best available price. I was able to purchase this phone for a wonderful price, and I also purchased the 2 year Square Trade insurance plan for just a little extra, which still made the phone hundreds of dollars less than the newest model. I have been using the phone now for a month, and I love it! Simple as that. The only problem I experienced after activating it at home with my previous sim card was that ALL of my old text messages from day 1 began to automatically download from the AT&T cloud. I was unable to disable that feature on my phone, so I went to my home computer, logged in to AT&T and disabled it from the main site. My text messages no longer sync to the cloud, but I don't care about that. Don't hesitate. Definitely purchase this phone if it fits all of your criteria. "	1
"My first impressions were bad, cause once I put the battery I couldn&apos;t take it out, and when I put the back cover I did find it kind of loose, but it stays in place (I think a case will help, but I haven&apos;t bought one yet).  Later when I turn on the phone and play with it, I was amazed with different features.     The only things that I really didn&apos;t like is that it RUNS OUT OF BATTERY QUICKLY, but at least I got also the car charger.     Overall is a Great phone for the price!"	1
"My first iPhone, and it lives up to the hype!"	1
"My first iPhone.  Works great, looks great, long battery life, love it.  Installed my sin card and off I went. "	1

My first time on Ebay and it was not a good experience. I used PayPal and sent the money right away and I have never received the Sanyo Phone I ordered. I have filed a claim with PayPal and have not got my money back or any feedback from the seller. I was duped big time and may probably not use Ebay again!!!!!	0

My g3 was giving me some issues. The biggest one being the wifi not working so I had decided to upgrade. The lg G4 is a good improvement from the G3 but after returning two of them I just switched to a different brand. Reason being that both phones could not connect to wifi at all. As much as I love the g3. I would skip the G4 and try the g5.	0

"My hearing is pretty bad, so before I renewed my Verizon contract a year ago, I researched for a phone that had a loud ring and good speaker volume. The Convoy had both, plus larger buttons that are easier for fat fingers to use. I can put my phone on the sun visor in my pickup truck, with the speaker-phone on and talk and hear just fine.  My research also told me this phone is rugged and water resistant. I am a construction worker (so I work in the weather), and a fisherman, so these features also helped me to decide to buy this phone.  I have found the battery life is excellent also. My wife&apos;s phone did not have very good battery life, and not very good quality speaker-phone, so I bought her a Convoy like mine off E-Bay, and she loves it, as I do mine. Her battery holds a full charge for a whole week!"	1

"My husband and I both have Nokia 6236i phones with Verizon.  They are the best cell phones we have ever had.  For comparison, we have had Blackberries, LG&apos;s, Motorola, Palm and most of them sucked.  (I also have a Nokia e71 smart phone mostly for web surfing (a no-contract $35 data plan with AT&amp;T, use Skype on it).    The Nokia 6236i is a great size, takes good photos considering the size and price point, easy to find headsets for, takes video, you can even get the data package and check email even if its a very small screen (its not meant for that so don&apos;t expect miracles).  I esp love the easy to use interface as opposed to, for example, an LG that has that awful Verizon splash screen garbage with non-intuitive icons a 5 year old would love.  Your photos can be set to wallpaper, too.  Text messaging capable, batteries are inexpensive, easy to find and long lasting.  I think the only thing it does not do is have customizable ringtones - but I don&apos;t want that.    I am ready for a new (used) 6236i three years later because this one has been put through the ringer.  I have dropped it, scratched it, taken it all over the country in the rain, snow, you name it.   Its just time for my trusty 6236i to be laid to rest and be replaced with exactly the same model.  I think I will be nice to this one, however, and put a screen cover on it so it won&apos;t scratch. My husband also needs one because he put his through the wash 3 years later (no biggie, it served him faithfully).    If you want a small phone, are okay with a &quot;candy bar&quot; style -- and want a camera?  Its a fabulous little phone.  And considering that Verizon is NOT known for good phones?  I would and DID go out of my way to get my hands on this little beauty.  Good job Nokia."	1
"My husband and I got three of these phones when we signed up for Cingular service.  They seem like they are loaded with features, but the phone doesn&apos;t last long.  We have had ours a little over a year and two of the three conked out several times and now all don&apos;t work.  Don&apos;t buy this phone!"	0
My husband and I have been using this type of LG for the last several years.It is easy to use and is durable.We have had a few quirky things happen with it as it gets older.When those moments happen we just pop out the battery and then put it back in.The problem is solved.We have lost count on the number of times we have dropped it and it still keeps going.When it gets to be over a year and a half or two the flip part starts to get loose and has eventually come apart after it was dropped to hard.Hope we can keep finding this phone on ebay when we need it.	1
"My husband and I have been wanting these since they came out and we finally got and in the colors we really wanted,perfect size in hand"	1
"My husband and I purchased two of these through Cingular a couple of years ago. Since then, each one has developed different intractable problems.     AUDIO PROBLEMS  After about 8 months of use, the audio in my husband&apos;s telephone stopped working. As a result, he couldn&apos;t hear conversations without having his head-piece attached. The phone would ring and ring while he continued to run around searching for a head-piece.     BATTERY PROBLEMS   Shortly thereafter, both of our phones developed an inability to re-charge. You would plug the phone into an outlet at night and the charging indicator light would appear; but the phone would still be on empty in the morning.    MISCELLANEOUS PROBLEMS  We both have experience problems with dropped calls (disregard the commercials). Finally, I have had considerable difficulty switching between lines because of the awkward and non-responsive key pad. When another call comes through while Im already on the phone, any attempt to switch lines will typically result in the loss of both conversations.    However, these phones have served us for two years now. So, for what its worth, they can last an eternity [my husband insists on waiting for them to completely die before we get new phones :( ]"	0
My husband bought the phone to take with him over seas. Phone didn&apos;t work when we got it. and there has just been too much bs with the seller. Some how a mix up with the address. They are expecting stuff they bought to come to our address. Just getting tired of dealing with this kind of stuff. When I don&apos;t even get on ebay its my  husband and he isn&apos;t here to deal with everything.	0
"My husband bought this phone because he wanted a camera phone @ a good price.  Overall the phone is alright, but the pictures are fuzzy and you have to be really careful with it.  It has good reception but when you are finished with it, if you shut it too hard it will turn itself off! My husband uses it when he wants to take pictures but for everyday use, he uses the phone that he bought this one to replace."	0
"My husband destroyed his phone, and when I found out that the cheapest replacement phone at the local Verizon store was $170.00, I turned to Ebay.  This phone does everything it promised.  Hubby just needs a plain basic phone, and this fills the bill.  I was able to get it hooked up with Verizon by following the simple instructions that came with it.  No problem.  I will definitely go this route again if I need to replace another phone.  This is a great basic phone.l"	1
My husband didnt want a big phone this is great for him	1
"My husband dropped his phone in the bay while fishing, so we had to replace it.  He really likes this phone so the only place we could find one was on ebay.  We got a great deal on it and it really is a great phone for a man."	1
"My husband encouraged me to get an iphone because everyone at his work with the new 4g iphone was very happy with the performance.   I have been very happy with my iphone, there are lots of apps and it works great."	1
"My husband had a Nokia 6010 and when it bit the dust, I went in search of one just like it. Meanwhile he was given a free replacement, so I got to keep the one I had purchased for him. It doesn&apos;t wash dishes or anything like that, =) but it well serves my purpose and I would buy it again. Enjoyed the whole experience!"	1
My husband had his old Rock phone for almost 5 years and was not interested in any other kind of phone. He dislikes change. We knew that Verizon had stopped carrying it and he was thrilled when I found one on Ebay. Our local Verizon store was able to program it and he is very happy with the phone	1
"My husband had this phone for 1 week, and he was already complaining about he cant hear, the lost calls, the voice command would not work, it wouldnt ring sometimes, sometimes it went to the voicemail, and we never knew anyone called, unless the left a message or the caller id appeared, and the ohone was on, with the ringer high. Then after 2 months of dealing with sprint, it was replaced with the same one, but a different one, and after 2 months after that, it was dropped from pocket to carpeted steps, and it broke in two!! The flip part broke away from the handheld part, and it was not fixable. CHEAP piece of you know what, but highly expensive and not worth a penny. The sprint guy that it was returned to, did not recommend this phone. They had other people having similad problems. You have it, get rid of it, you dont want it, dont buy it!!"	0
"My husband has had this model phone for a couple of years and loves it for its size, ease of use, etc.  So he was upset when he dropped his in the water and fried it. He called Verizon to find they no longer offered the phone and then I found it on this website.  He is so happy to have his Juke again!.  It arrived quickly, in new condition and is as expected."	1
"My husband has this phone.  I bought it for him when I upgraded a few months back.  He wanted a phone with more features and the ability to take pictures and bring home.  Last weekend we were shopping at a salvage store.  I shot photos with his phone.  I sometimes take photos of things from this store and pre-sell the items on ebay.  Well... much to my dismay, you can only SEND pics from this phone.  There is no way to upload them.  I feel this is a scam.  It costs air time and money to upload pictures.  Folks beware of all this photo capable advertising.   Find out how user friendly or computer compatable first.  Taking pictures is great but if it cost you 25 cents a shot to send them anywhere?  How great a value is that?"	0
"My husband has thrown his, dropped it on concrete repeatedly, and it even survived a fire (flames directly on it, sections melted) - the screen did not crack through any of that abuse.  He recently purchased a new one because after the fire it was acting a bit strange, but it still worked.  Our daughter had one, dropped it in the road and it was run over by a dump truck, and it still worked.  It was pretty beat up though (screen was cracked and small sections of the plastic were missing) so we got her another one (this one for this review).  Neither of them have had issues with the battery or storage, or anything, just a great phone and it holds up to anything."	1
"My husband is not a &quot;smart phone&quot; guy. He needed something old style/flip phone, sharp perception, dependable. The Jitterbug Plus was just what he needed. We were a little mislead or just didn&apos;t understand the extra cost for minutes that we thought were included with the plan. Still, overall, it was much less than what a plan that neither of us need would have cost. We do not live on the phone and just needed something to keep in contact with kids and grandkids. Thank you, Jitterbug and seller. Well worth the purchase. /:-D  We do not use the 5* plan, just the phone service."	1
"My husband is old school, and hates to learn a new device. His ol Maxx 2 broke, and the Turbo 2 is the upgrade, with faster processor, more memory & shatter proof screen. This has been a great option, so far. We will probably even buy another as a backup, when this one eventually fails. ALL phones will fail at some time."	1

"My husband lost his XV6800 while on vacation.  Our cellular phone company wanted to charge us $30/month for a data plan if we replaced his phone with a newer smartphone model.  However, since he had a XV6800 previously without the charge and replaced it with the same model, he was able to get the charge waived. Unfortunately, the eBay phone needed to be rebooted 2-3 times per day, which was very frustrating.  In the end, he got a new smartphone."	0

"My husband loves this phone and would highly recommend it to anyone!  A little difficult to navigate, especially when used to using a smart phone touch screen.        It makes a perfect replacement for the touchscreen smart phone at a fraction of the price, and it works just fine on our network (T-Mobile)."	1
My husband loves this phone it is like vandalproof It has great features and not delicate loike the rest of the phones out there!!	1
My husband needed a durable phone for the type of job he does.  This phone is perfect!	1

My husband ordered this when I lost my Straight Talk phone and it turned out to be a HUGE NIGHTMARE!!  NO WHERE on the website does it say or indicate the Zip Code it works in (which is a major biggie for S.T.). You have to submit your code to see if that phone will work with your service area.  Now part of this is on S.T. since it took them almost 3 weeks and four people later to figure out this phone will not work in the Midwest.	0

"My husband&apos;s old phone had become obsolete, so he bought a phone from the High St. He was told that it was simple to use - not only was it NOT simple to use but he couldn&apos;t hear it when it rang. I&apos;d recently bought a Motorola V620 and was very happy with it, so we decided to bid for one on EBay for my husband. He is delighted with it! It does everything that he needs - the camera isn&apos;t brilliant but he doesn&apos;t need that!"	1
"My interest was a little different than most. I wanted an inexpensive android smartphone to use as a talking GPS unit, using the free app OsmAnd. This phone is perfect. I was able to get it for $9.99, and I did not activate the contract. Instead, I just set it up without phone service, and used WiFi to download the app and some offline maps. I now have a talking GPS unit that I can use for routefinding when I am biking, all for $9.99! For my application and use, this is a perfect match."	1

"My last phone Galaxy SII died and I don&apos;t do contracts with phone companies so I had to try to find something in my budget. After searching and reviewing multiple phones I decided on the HTC M7, would have loved to get the M8 version but was more than I wanted to spend at the time. After having this phone for a few months I have to say I love it, it doesn&apos;t have an sd slot but the 32gb is plenty of room for me and I have a lot of apps on this thing a ton of pictures and 3 full length movies and I still have about 20gb left. I did root mine when I got it, just because I don&apos;t like all the t-mobile junk that came on it. Bottom line this is an awesome phone and there is only a couple of differences between the M7 &amp; M8 but if you afford the M8 do it you will get a SD slot and a little better camera."	1
"My latest swapout makes this the fourth Sanyo phone that I&apos;ve had, in nearly 10 years with Sprint - and all of them have been excellent.  (Note: The longer you stay with Sprint, the better offers they extend to you on service plans and phone replacements.  Good customer loyalty program.)    My previous Sanyo&apos;s have all been straight-handset models, which I preferred - but the world is going to Flip-Phones, so I decided to put some trust in Brand Experience when making the move.  I haven&apos;t been disappointed.    The 2400 has the Largest Screen that I have ever had on a phone - and the large number display is a relief for aging eyes.  The Separate Keys are far superior to the membrane keyboards I have suffered with on other brands.    Unlike many Flip-Phones, the 2400 has an Extendable Antenna.  You don&apos;t need to extend it in strong signal areas, but out in the fringes it is often the difference between connecting and not connecting.  The 2400&apos;s performance is right up there with the best straight handsets I ever had - definitely superior to those with internal antennas.    I am a traditionalist, who believes a Phone should just be a Phone, as that is what I use it for.  And the 2400 does a fine job as just a Phone.    For those who just HAVE to do Internet, Walkie-Talkie, etc. - the 2400 does support Sprint&apos;s Vision and Ready Link services, with nicely placed controls and easy menus.  Unlike many other modern phones, though, it also has menu options to completely disable those extras - for guys like me, who don&apos;t want to be bothered every time they brush the wrong button.    For those of you who must have a Camera Phone, check out the Sanyo 3100.  Same Case design and size as the 2400, with a 1.3mp digicam in the lid.  Many accessories - such as Belt Holsters, Cases, and Chargers - are interchangeable between the two models.  Both are available in at least five different color schemes (a different five for each model).    The 2400 (and its camera-cousin, the 3100, which my wife has) are both solid performers.  If you&apos;re outfitting the whole family, a blending of these two models should cover everyone&apos;s tastes in both features and colors - with full compatibility of accessories."	1
"My LG C1300 cracked after many years of use so I needed a replacement and I found this one on Ebay. This phone was brand new and identical to mine so switching the chip and transferring my data was easy. This phone was brand new,  unused, w/finish protection vinyl all around."	1

I recommend buying from this seller. My apologies for doubting you. Thanks!"	1

"My main problem with this phone is that its description includes that it has an internet browser, however this is not true.  There is no internet or Get It Now feature.  Also the battery life is very poor...I have to charge it every day, and even when it&apos;s been fully charged, a 20 minute conversation and the phone is beeping at me for a low battery.  The only good thing is the charger connection is the same as my GPS, so I can use my GPS car charger for the phone.  Another reviewer mentioned that it isn&apos;t very loud even at the highest volume.  Mine, however is VERY loud, which is good especially for the alarm feature."	0
My midframe was falling apart. Found this product that didn't cost much. Was a little worn but it was better than before. Can't complain.	1

My mistake on purchasing a phone I didn't check to see who the provider was. I purchased for our granddaughter who has a prepaid AT&T account. But this phone is a Verizon. The seller should state as such in the listing instead of telling me I should of investigated the provider. As a seller he should state clearly the provider. If you are honest in your listing there should be no problem. I thought I could get this hooked up through AT&T. Next time I will investigate as he suggested. We also purchased a 2year insurance plan that during checkout you get that option to purchase. I realize it wasn't purchased through the seller. But a different company. 	0
"My mom bought it for my birthday, not pleased. I know what the phone is worth and 100$ may have been a good price for this phone a year ago. I bought the same phone a year and a half ago for 70$ and that phone was in better condition this phone."	0

My mom refuses to get a smart phone and loves this phone.  She is hard of hearing and wears hearing aids and t-coils and she says she can hear great on this phone.  She also likes the separate and slightly raised buttons.	1

"My old phone was the Samsung Omnia I, which is peanuts compared to the LG ally. I was debating for a long time whether to get the Ally or the HTC Touch Pro II, and I&apos;m glad I made this choice. Phone is a little bit complicated at first, but the touch screen is SUPER RELIABLE. Its a little bit weird that you have to press the &quot;HOME&quot; button to go home instead of &quot;END&quot; Like most phones. Other then that, I&apos;m still exploring!!!  ~&lt;3333"	1
My old Samsung had cracked glass and it finally gave up the ghost. Couldn't afford a new one so I bought a used off ebay for around $80 with shipping. Works great.	1
"My older model works better than this phone brand new. You can't do anything with apps on it. It's completely obsolete. Even with an additional storage card and with having rooted the phone, it cannot sync and also has a terrible screen/camera with no flash or light available. It acts as though it was released in 2012?! I'm shocked at the quality HTC is willing to release. Very unfortunate"	0
My oldest baby bro LOVED it :] Was exactly what hed wanted as his gift in every way! Thanks for everything	1
My only con so far is the battery and lack of an SD card slot. 	1

My original Katana was a perfect phone. It got soaked and died.... I decided to just get the newer version even though I looked at all the fancy phones you can buy when you get a new contract. It is HORRIBLE. The seller was fine. The phone is such poor quality- speaker phone or voice mail- you can hardly understand a word. It is cheaply made compared to my other one which was at least 3 years older. Don&apos;t buy it.	0
My other 3589 is great.  This seller shipped me a water damaged one.  Ebay won&apos;t resolve.  Thanks!  This why I avoid Ebay...	0
"My other S5 broke only a month after I bought it. Lesson learned. I got a case for this one BEFORE I got the phone. It is my favorite Galaxy yet. It does exactly what I need it to, it's a good size, and except for NEEDING to be in a case, it's perfect."	1
"My overall rating is a big ZERO.  The purchase was a nightmare.  Seller customer service was a nightmare.  They write english  like kindergarten age children from the slums.  I never received received the cellphone. And after a nearly two months of frustration, I finally asked ebay and PayPal to intervene so I can get my money back.  Thanks to PayPal and ebay, my money was refunded.  I RECOMMEND THAT THIS SELLER BE BARRED FROM DOING BUSINESS THRU EBAY.   FOR ALL EBAY CUSTOMERS WHO MAY SEE THIS REVIEW, DON&apos;T EVER WASTE YOUR MONEY AND TIME TRYING TO PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM THIS SELLER."	0
"My overall rating on this phone is POOR not because the phone was bad but because I was given the wrong information and the phone is totally useless for me.    Not being in the phone business like the Seller is I wasn&apos;t sure if an unlocked phone would work or how that works.  So I sent him an e-mail letting him know that I am on the Verizon network and would this work for me?  He advised me that it would.  This phone will only work with services like AT&amp;T, Sprint and similar networks.    Buyer beware!"	0
My package was not delivered and sent back to the seller. Totally ridiculous.  I have not ever had a problem with my address or shipping with ebay so I dont understand why this happened. 	0
My part came 3 days early was correct to the detail. Staff was very fast answering questions. Nice to know business's still operate at such a high level. 	1
"My phone appears refurbished.  A deep scratch exists on screen after removing flimsy plastic sheets loosely protecting phone.  This is not like the packaging I have ever seen for an LG phone, including the box, which is rather plane and missing stickers with fcc model and imei numbers.  Also, the shipper did not answer my question about the phone until the day it arrived.  The shipper has not responded to my complaint about the condition of the phone or claim it is not new.  I had hoped he would remove the word NEW from the description.  On the plus side, the phone was shipped very quickly.  "	0
"My phone arrived dead & took a significant amount of time to charge just enough to turn it on. There was damage by the front camera & the rear camera wouldnt focus. There were several apps already open, including a voice memo of someone checking the mic quality. Also, Im not totally sure what model it was, but it wasn't even a 6S. Didnt check much else as Id already decided to send it back."	0
"My phone arrived within 24hrs and its in mint condition. Seemed like scam considering the unbelievable deal, but it had good reviews so I bought it. I could never regret my decision. Thank you to the seller. "	1
My phone broke on vacation.  I was so happy to see the same brand and style on sale on ebay for a remarkable price.  It was sent right away and I was able to get &quot;back on the grid&quot; in a very timely manner.  Though an old style - the quality of this phone is excellent and I find the style extremely convenient.	1
"My phone came as described and worked great at first. However, after 2 months of using the phone, the camera stopped working, the home button stopped working, the screen stopped being receptive to my touch, and the phone stopped sending correct notifications for apps. I have no idea what exactly happened with it, but it was a complete waste of money."	0

My phone came with the screen loose and not fitting right on the phone ..  Terrible !	0

My phone finally arrived but it was the local post office shenanigans and not the seller. So far no issues with the phone. 	1
My phone got water damage over the summer. Months later the logic board finally burned out. This item is exact to the one I removed. Works perfectly.	1
"My phone got water damaged so I went on eBay and I bought this phone as a substitute since I use my phone for work everyday. I paid within seconds from winning the auction on this phone, 24 hours passed and I got no notification that it was shipped, I contacted the seller and they said their listing said it would ship in two days (I went through the whole listing and didn't find anything saying that) then they said they were shipping it that night and that didn't happen either, on the third day I messaged the seller again wondering what's going on? They never responded and canceled my order shortly after. Now I still didn't get my money back and my time was nothing but a waste, I'm disappointed I had to give one start since I couldn't give zero stars . I hope everyone reads this before buying from this seller! "	0
My phone had damage to it and when asked to just give a little money back instead of returning the seller states they would not do it. The description said the phone was brand new never used. I think integrity goes a long way and the fair thing to do would have been a partial refund.	0

"My phone seems to work fine, but there are permanent streaks on the face of the phone that cause a glare. So it's hard to see the screen well outside. They don't clean off, it's under the surface or something. Obviously not a new phone like stated. But, my other one is totally done for so I have to keep this."	0
"My phone was dead on arrival. Lately eBay sellers have been minimizing the quality to save money at the expense of their customers' time. Having gone through a similar process on my last eBay phone purchase, I am fed up. Avoid this - this phone was someone else's problem and that's why it's on eBay now."	0
"My phone was in perfect condition. I received it within a couple of days, and when I asked questions about the product, the seller answered my questions promptly."	1

"My previous Nokia 5310 worked great so I don&apos;t know why the one I received from the EBay seller works so poorly. It is supposed to be new but seems to already be programmed with security codes so I don&apos;t know if I received the item that was described. The phone breaks up constantly, I cannot send pics via text which was no problem with the previous Nokia 5310 I owned. I also cannot access the web and many of the words on this phone are misspelled."	0
"My previous phone broke, and I needed a replacement. Best phone I've ever had since galaxy S7."	1
"My previous phone of the same model died. I didn&apos;t want to learn a new phone. This phone is the perfect replacement. Seller stated condition exactly as it is. Good price for a used phone. This is a basic phone for basic pay-as-I-go calls. It also has the option for upgrades, if I choose to go with a plan that has more bells and whistles."	1
My previous phone was a Samsung S6. The Note 9 is so much better in every category it's mind boggling.  I also like the price I paid as well.	1
"My problem is not with the seller but the characteristic. Samsung piss me off with the  Note 8 with those apps from Galaxy APP; they need to understand we cannot have 2 markets place and play store with Google is enough. Samsung music (when I finish to play a video in youtube or website  is not syncing with my car, it just stop where the video was standing. Give me back the Music player!!!) and clock are badly bad. The phone is too long I prefer it larger as tablet, if I need to change my battery I will have to expand another money to do that, the home button in the corner should be on front of the phone. I have Samsung connect that is futile because I am already get Google Chromecast (HOME).  Overhaul, I switch from Note 2 (the best phone ever Samsung has been made) to Note 8 and I really regret the move. I hope in the future thing is getting better.     "	0
My promble is with the seller not mark the item I brought say shipped and it don't tale more than 24 hours to do so that pour lazy on the seller end if I had a item up for sell I would mark shipped not make people wait on it tha t show not a good seller 	0
My property manager uses this style phone and he is very pleased about its easy use.  It takes a lot of abuse and keeps on working.  I would recommend this model as a good phone in the contruction industry.	1

"My purchase of a used T62u cell phone, was for my son (who loses, and/or destroys his cell phones a couple times a year).    I didn&apos;t want to spend a lot of money on the phone, that&apos;s why I chose ebay for my purchase.    I selected this phone instead of one of the other phones with all of the bells and whistles (camera, color screen, etc.) for two reasons:    1. The cost    2. Because it was one of the two GAIT phones Cingular ever had. GAIT phones are nolonger available, only digital phones now. GAIT phones have better reception (or more network options for coverage) than the new phones, they pick up Analog, TDMA, and new Digital signals from available towers. This allow reception in areas the digital phones typically don&apos;t have available.    I am happy with my purchase, it was just as described in the listing on ebay, as were the rest of my ebay purchases to date."	1

My Samsung Vibrant phn fell in the toilet last week and stopped working. I purchased this used phn and it looks new. It works great and I am happy i got my phone back. The price was great compared to buying a brand new phn at $400 from T-Mobile.	1
My screen has turned green. Which makes it very hard to see things. I've sent an email to the person I obtained the phone from.  I haven't heard back. There was no phone number that's why I emailed him  I hope you can help me  	0
"My second G4 plus. The first one came with Android Marshmallow. It was a great phone, outstanding GPS reception which is important to me. The only problem with that phone was the ""ghost touches"" issue, especially when the phone is cold. I bought this second phone which came with Android Nougat, and have not experienced any of the ""ghost touches"" symptoms. Same great GPS performance."	1
My second one - first one 3 years ago.  This is a great phone... love the keypad and features.	1
"My second one. Dropped first one multiple times. Left out in the rain, overnite. Never had any problems. Finally broke frt screen when I dropped it once too many times.   This music player phone is way better than the newer chocolate phones."	1
My second purchase from UnLockedCellPhoneKings - their phones work right out of the box. Others I&apos;ve tried have not. Go with the king!	1

"My sister had a Motorola E815 that she&apos;d used for 2 years, before handing it down to me and getting a different model. I used her phone for 4 years before it finally died. I found one in beautiful Magenta on Ebay and was thrilled to get my &quot;new phone&quot;. It has great reception (I drove 1750 miles from Nebraska to Washington State and only had about 30 miles without reception, so that&apos;s Verizon and a good phone)and is a durable phone, as I&apos;m a flight attendant and constantly dropping it. It has a camera, bluetooth, games, media (if I wanted it), all that I want and need. I&apos;m not locked into any contract since I got it on Ebay and I hope to have it for years to come. I can&apos;t say enough about this phone! When I took it into Verizon to get it programmed all of the employees came over to see the Magenta phone, as they said they&apos;d never seen it in that color before. They were all saying that was the best phone that ever passed through their store."	1
My sister is in love with the phone. Thank you!!	1
My sister is really enjoying this phone.  She bought it with her birthday money.  These phone are not available at a Sprint store anymore.	1
"My sister loved the phone, I am very happy about the purchase. It came in a safe package, there were almost to none scratches, and the battery of the phone works well. "	1
My sister loved this phone!	1
"My sister uses a $300 Apple Phone and my other sister has a $150 Samsung Phone. Both of them have been through over four phones since 2017. The screens on all of their phones, including the ones at present, are cracked to hell. I bought this phone for $19.99 at the beginning of 2016, dropped from three stories, out of my pocket multiple times, it fell in a fountain, a toilet, and in a puddle, and it has thrived past 5 adolescent and toddler nieces and nephews. This is the phone I use now. It has never died despite being waterlogged, and it still has over 11 hours of battery life on a bad day with full use. About 22 on a good day.  'Nough Said."	1
"My sixteen year old son loves this phone. I bought it for him after he dropped the first one that i purchased for him. Great experience, very good phone. Great price for a Great phone."	1
My son (16 y.o.) was actually using my old flip but wanted it in red.  He loves everything about this phone.	1
My son accidently broke his phone and we   needed a replacement . Also it was a good   price  as well as it was new and in good   condition .	1
"MY SON AND I BOTH DETEST THIS PHONE IT IS HAS HORRIBLE RECEPTION AND IS GLITCHY. WE ARE STUCK WITH THEM. WE HAVE ONLY HAD THEM ABOUT 2 MONTHS AND FYI VERIZON ONLY OFFERS A 20 DOLLAR TRADE IN VALUE, THAT TELLS YOU A STORY RIGHT THERE. WORST PHONE WE HAVE EVER HAD!"	0
My son broken it in one day.	0
My son did not want the plus model because he says it is too big for his 12 year old hands. He loves it! 	1
"My son is at the age where he now needs a cell phone. Of course, he would also need to text! I personally had never texted, so I thought I should buy a phone with a keypad and learn to text before he gets his own phone. When I saw the picture of the phone I loved the great big keypad! I read the details about the phone and it made some sence to me. The SMS text-messaging is what I really was interested in. I figured that once I got the phone I would learn about the &quot;data service&quot; thing and Java and Bluetooth later. Blackberry&apos;s require a &quot;data service plan&quot; this means you have to pay a monthly fee to your service provider for internet or email, even if you don&apos;t want it! This phone also has a &quot;turn wheel&quot; on the side of the phone to scroll through the icons on the phone. It is horrid! To me, this phone is very out dated and almost dinosaur-ish&quot;! It is also HUGE!! like wide and heavy. My suggetion is you go to a local cell phone store and handle the phones, ask questions, try out the features. Then once you have found the one for you, come home, turn on you PC and and find a great deal on ebay."	0
"My son is happy with this purchase.  Not the newest model, but it still had the features and memory that he wanted."	1
My son is very happy with his new phone.  He&apos;d had several others by a different manufacturer and all had the same issues within a very short period of time after receiving them.  I&apos;ve carried Motorola equipment for years and swear by their product.  We looked for hours and finally settled on this one.  The price was great and he is very please with the quality of service this product is giving him.  Yeah Ebay!	1
"My son lost his iPhone and was really distraught. We were going on vacation for a little over a week and he would have been lost without his music. This seller communicated with me immediately and indicated if I bought immediately, he would ship out the same day and I would receive before we left on vacation. Not only did he do what he said, but the phone arrived a day early. THANK YOU SO much for making my son&apos;s vacation - he was really bummed out!"	1
My son loved the phone. Very good condition and fast delivery.	1
My son loves his new phone. He did receive the wrong color but he ended liking that color also . Recd it sooner than expected A++++	1
My son loves iPhone and this was an excellent buy for him without paying the high price. He is completely satisfied.	1
My son loves it. He can download plenty of apps. Easy to navigate. A mp3 player so he can listen to music with headphones. Good for a 14 year old if you don&apos;t want to spend bundles on an iphone for them to tear up.	1
My son loves the phone. Has had no problems and loves all the features. He says it&apos;s like having a computer in your pocket!	1

my son needed a new phone. i bought this one because it looked like something my son would like. i gave it to him the other day and he said it works great. this is why i decided to buy the item.  : )	1
My son ordered this phone on may 19th &amp; it is now the 28th. It was supposed to be priority 2 day shipping through usps. A tracking number was provided but there still no shipping info. I&apos;ve tried contacting the seller a few days ago but I nor my son has yet to hear anything from the seller. Not a very happy customer.	0

"My son took the battery out and put it back in to turn on and then it went to the white screen ""Blu bold like Us"" and wont go no where else!"	0
My son used the phone happily for over a week before noting that the headphone jack wasn't working.  I contacted the seller and they were very accommodating and handled the return smoothly and professionally.  It's always a relief to deal with vendors that stand behind their sales so thoroughly!	1
"My son wanted this phone and was very surprised when he realized he could save alot of money because if you do not pay for the t mobile data plan the internet will work wireless in any wifi spot or home you can connect to. This lets him use an unlimited text  $15.00 a month phone plan, which works out to be very reasonable as teenagers use text and rarely make a call or receive one these days. For me adding a line and data was a minimum of $49.99 on my t mobile plan. So we are enjoying a savings of 35.00 a month which saves over $400.00 a year for just his phone."	1
My son was really looking forward to this phone and when it arrived the digitizer sensed touch in only a few spots on the phone. I sent it back and the seller refunded my money... I think.	0
my son was very happy with the phone he had one before and broke the screen and stated he would like to get the same phone but this time we got a screen protector	1
"My son-in-law loves this phone because he says fits good in his pocket...an older phone, so that is why we ordered 2 in case this one gets damaged.  He lost his original phone in a car accident and was lost without his phone. Nice small phone."	1

My very first expensive phone responds fast like the picture quality the web is fast i really reccomend	1
"My wife and I have owned the Breeze II, III, and now IV.  Perfect phone for one who doesn't want/need a smartphone.  Call quality and battery life very good.  Normal useful features.  The IV is a little larger, with a larger screen (which is welcome).  Still fits very comfortably in my pocket.  AT&T stopped doing business with Pantech, so I needed to go to eBay to find two IVs to purchase for me and my wife.  I hope a product like the Breeze IV will always be available to folks like us."	1
"my wife enjoys this phone she has not had a problem with it, ever since she lost the first phone she has not been happy with any other. Hey she old fashion, but what ever makes her happy is fine with me. Thank you"	1
My wife had one and I just had to get one. I love this phone and all the options. I traded from a T-mobile dash and the sidekick wins hands down !!!!! Would highly recommend this phone to anyone interested in a phone with alot of options. P.S. kinda limited on options if you don&apos;t have internet with your plan.	1
My wife has a 6 year old Samsung still working like new so after having several other brands with issues I decided to try one.  This Convoy does everything well and even better than I imagined.  The speaker phone is so clear it is not necessary to have hands free device in the car and every function works perfectly.  The battery life is extreeeeeeeeemely long.	1
My wife has had this phone for 5+ years. Whenshe first got it I thought that it would break very quickly. Years later and it still works great!	1
My wife has has a razor for the past 6 years and will have nothing else.  She was won over immediately.  The ease of operation. The slimness of being able to fit in her fannypac and able to last 6years with 6 children.  Only thing replaced was we changed to a extended life battery. Notheing fancy or a lota gagets.  As far as we are concerned value for the buck you can not beat we bought 2 more.	1
My wife is happy with this phone. Being older she didn't want to learn anything new. EXCELLENT condition 	1
"My wife is hard to please when it comes to telephones.  This phone made her very happy and when she&apos;s happy, I&apos;m happy.  The phone is easy to use, very solidly built and works just like it should.  No bumps, no problems.  I can recommend this phone to anyone wanting an excellent quality phone."	1
"My wife is very hard on phones and she loses them as well. Since these are pretty inexpensive, she doesn't worry much if it gets lost or broken, making it a very practical choice for us."	1
"My wife lost my LG 6000 which I had for several years.I&apos;d bought my son a 6100, a year ago,and figured it was time to upgrade mine.Mainly, this model has the Mobile Office Kit,which allows you,like I had for my 6000, to connect phone to laptop to get the internet off of your AIR TIME MINUTES with NO extra charge.  Verizon and the other phone companies typically charge by the Kbyte,on what they usually refer to as &quot;data packages&quot; which adds up very fast.Since I feel cheated that I&apos;m already paying an exhorbitant fee for my phone just to use it, why ALSO get nailed on a data charge?The MOK is fantastic,and basically does what putting a modem on a phone line at your house does.So the MOK is the way to go.      Its not blazing fast,but hey,it is fast enough that there is essentially no lag time on surfing,and it gets me what I need online. I&apos;m a catastrophic adjuster, and spend many hours on the road in areas where there is NO internet connectivity in hotels,restaurants,etc,and this allows me to handle my claims for my clients when there is no other connection, as well as stay in touch with my family when I&apos;m away, by email.I can use it ANYWHERE I have a cell phone signal(my car)and again,its FREE because its off my airtime minutes.Guess what?After 9pm,its completely free,just like my minutes.I&apos;m sure this is why Vrzn and all the other companies started charging &quot;data&quot; rates.  They see another sector they can stream money off the public.  That&apos;s show biz...      I realize that if you need broadband speed, there&apos;s the options of using the pcmcia cards with the little antennas, but again, this is essentially a free modem line off your phone using your laptop.  And unless you are living in the handful of major cities, they don&apos;t tell you about that you dont GET the high speed broadband off those cards they are capable of.  So again, the MOK is for all intent and purposes a great alternative.       Ok, thats MY reason for getting the 6100.  There are sexier, sleeker phones out there, but guess what?  Who cares!!  This is a terrific phone, it WORKS well in areas that normally have crappy service, and my dropouts are minimal. This is of course due to whoever you use for a carrier, and every state has better or worse coverage. In WA, I get 1-3 bars, outside WA, all over U.S. I get 6 bars! I&apos;d love to find the perfect cell phone/carrier, but from everyone I&apos;ve talked to, no one is happy with their service ever, it seems.  So its hit or miss.  Back to the phone.  Its got a lot of good features, all more in quantity than my 6000 had; more picture storage, has a flash, 6000 doesn&apos;t, speaker phone (absolutely essential for driving), voice activatated dialing and recognition (very cool), and simpler to use than the 6000, all in all, a very nice upgrade.I&apos;ve checked to see if the MOK is available for the upper end models, but I haven&apos;t found it, at least the FREE air time kit, I believe verizon makes it for other phones, but you PAY for the service on top of airtime.  It does NOT have bluetooth, so if thats a necessity for you, this is not the phone. (I don&apos;t know if there&apos;s any addons to this phone that give you bluetooth, probably not.)I think the next model up is the 8100 or 8300 and has bluetooth,but check the phone site to be sure.  My next upgrade when my contract runs out will probably be to a Treo or something like that, that will give me all this stuff in one place instead of having to use a laptop.  Hope this helps!-Jim    Update to this review next..."	1
"My wife loved her Motorola razr phone never wanting to part with it until it broke. I went directly to eBay and found one exactly like hers including battery and charger. It wasn&apos;t long before she had her phone back, good working condition, same color, exactly like the one she had! I&apos;m grateful for a place like eBay and the many good and honest sellers."	1

"My wife wanted a phone like mine, but not in the dull grey. I found it in girly pink and she just had to have it. She loves it. The seller provided free shipping and easy to follow instructions on how to activate the phone--took ~10 minutes start to finish.  Phone was in great shape with brand new accessories.  This phone is probably the last of it&apos;s kind--a phone with great features that was built durable with the intent to last for more than a year like most phones."	1
"My wife wanted a replacement for her Samsung Galaxy 5.   She stopped enjoying the phone after one year. I bought it for her for nearly $700.00.   The first problem was the phone was starting to look beat up. It was a white plastic case with chrome colored plastic.   Cosmetically, the phone was looking worse for the wear.   The second issue was the Micro USB port was not making good contact and it was getting difficult to charge the phone.  My wife was not complaining about performance.   The phone was plenty fast.  She did complain that the phone only had 16 GB which when I bought it was twice the 8GB she had on her last phone.  I showed my wife several bargain phones that she didn't like.  Several of the phones were styled to look like iPhones.   She said if you want to get me a phone that looks like an iPhone, buy me an iPhone.  When I showed her the YotaPhone 2, she really liked the look.  I was able to buy the YotaPhone 2 for her for only $139.95.   I had seen the phone advertised as low as $119.95 but all of the places listing that price were sold out.     I was concerned about two things.  The first was the resolution of the camera.  The other was that the OS was 4.4 and some software I used would not run on 4.4.  I went ahead and ordered the phone.   I was able to upgrade "	1
My Wife wanted an older phone that was just a phone and would work from the house with out standing in the yard on one foot while waving her left arm .

"Nachdem mein Motorola Milestone 1 nach 4 Jahren nun oft nicht mehr so wollte, wie ich, und auch Leistungsm��ig nicht mehr das hergab, wie man es gewohnt war, wollte ich mir den neuesten Nachfolger holen, da ich nicht auf die Hardware-Tastatur verzichten wollte. Nun musste ich aber feststellen, dass aus der Reihe ab dem Droid 2 nicht mehr in Deutschland released wird. Da es nun in Deutschland (aus meiner Sicht) nur Schrott mit Hardware-Tastatur gibt, stand f�r mich der Import des Droid 3 aus den USA fest, zumal es hier schon fertig Unlocked angeboten wird.  Zu den hier bezahlten Kosten muss man �brigens noch mit ca. 50 Euro Zoll und Versandkosten in D. rechnen, die f�r gew�hnlich �ber UPS abgerechnet werden.    Nun zum Produkt selbst:  Positiv anzumerken sind:   + Gute Leistung (1GHz - DualCore)   + Fl�ssige Bedienung   + �berarbeitete Hardware-Tastatur   + Gro�es Display (4 Zoll, 960�540)   + SD-Karte kann ohne Entfernen das Akkus herausgenommen werden   + HDMI-Out   + Schickes Design    Negative Punkte:   - Vergleichsweise kleiner Arbeitsspeicher (512 Mb)   - (Nat�rlich) ein zu schwacher Akku, aber wo ist das heute nicht der Fall   - Power-Knopf etwas umst�ndlich zu erreichen   - Fehlender Kamera-Knopf   - Gef�hlte 5000 Apps von Verizon, die in D. vollkommmen nutzlos sind und st�ndig im Hintergrund laufen   - Sprache des Betriebssystems nur auf Englisch und Spanisch einstellbar (Apps k�nnen trotzdem Deutsch laufen, z.B. mit der App Local Select)    Die letzten beiden Punkte sind wohl unvermeidlich, wenn das Produkt gar nicht f�r Deutschland gedacht war. Wer sich dennoch daran st�rt (besonders an den Verizon-Apps, die auch wertvollen Arbeitsspeicher klauen), kann das Handy auch rooten und sie dann deinstallieren. Dazu w�rde ich &quot;Motofail&quot; von Dan Rosenberg empfehlen. Die restlichen Exploits wurden anscheinend mit dem letzten Update beseitigt, bei mir funktionierten sie nicht mehr. Ohne die unn�tzen Apps l�uft das Ger�t auf jeden fall nochmal sp�rbar fl�ssiger.  Viele beschweren sich �ber das Pentile Display, welches eine gewisse unsch�rfe ins Bild bringen soll. Mir ist es zwar noch nicht negativ aufgefallen, ist auf jeden Fall besser, als beim Droid 1. Ist nat�rlich ein St�ck weit Geschmackssache, genauso wie das Gewich des Smartphones. Ja, es ist sehr massiv und schwer, aber ich mag es, wenn ich weis, dass ich was in der Hand halte. Wie gesagt, Geschmackssache.  Was den Empfang in D. angeht, hab ich das gef�hl, er k�nnte besser sein, aber er ist auf alle F�lle ok. Schwierigkeiten hatte ich noch keine. Was mir noch sehr positiv aufgefallen ist, ist dass das einloggen in ein gespeichertes Wlan-Netz erstaunlich schnell vonstatten geht, was man vom Droid 1 nicht behaupten konnte.  Die Kamera mit 8 MP und HD-Video-Funktion ist wie bei gleichwertigen Smartphones nix dolles. F�r mich ersetzt sie auf keinen Fall eine Digi-Cam.  Der HDMI-Ausgang funktioniert an sich tadellos, bei h�ngt es am Anfang zwar ein bisschen, das kann aber auch am Kabel/Adapter liegen. Auf jeden Fall eine nette Idee.    Zusammenfassend kann man also sagen, dass man f�r den Preis ein ziemlich Leistungsstarkes Smartphone bekommt, das in Sich ein Rundes Bild ablegt. Lediglich der zu kleine Arbeitsspeicher ist der einzige gr��ere Sch�nheitsfehler, der sich jedoch mit entfernen der Verizon-Apps verschmerzen l�sst (s.o.).  Ich bin sehr zufrieden damit (und ich habe nicht wenige Anspr�che ;)) und w�rde das Produkt jederzeit wieder kaufen.  Ich hoffee, ich konnte weiterhelfen und w�nsche einen sch�nen Tag"	1

Name brand 4G phone from LG with all the useful features and at a reasonable price.  This is a name brand full featured smartphone. I use it in my phone store and it has good response time and sound quality. Works perfect for any USA based T-Mobile carrier. If you have an AT&T based carrier check the bandwidths for compatablity.	1

Neat little phone however when it comes to actually using the device it is useless. Can barely use it. Most of the time it just does what it wants. Battery dies within 30 minutes of standstill time. Would reccommend for fun use. But not for practical use.	0

"Needed a good,easy to use phone with a larger keypad for ease of use. This fitted the bill perfectly - ok, it&apos;s not a top of the range 3g phone, but if you&apos;re just looking for a phone you can use easily this is the one - just one instance being that the sound is excellent.  As it happens the camera is pretty good too!  I haven&apos;t got round to using all of the features it offers yet, but I expect they&apos;ll be up to the mark and user friendly just as the other functions are.    PS - might be standard to you, and on clamshell phones generally, but I love the fact that it locks and unlocks the keypad on closing and opening the clamshell, saved me a lot of &apos;accidents&apos; and credit on pay as you go."	1
needed a new battery and back for my daughters phone so it was perfect for replacing the old one out!	1
"Needed a new phone and thought this would be a great buy... Turned out I was wrong the phone turned out to not be so great.  things i disliked was the fact it felt real cheap and for a phone that was 169$ at the time I bought it was not worth it. Screen would flicker and the battery sucks and when i have to charge my phone in the middle of the day is not good. if it can&apos;t make it through a whole day then it not worth my money. I bought it on cyber Monday and instead of getting a good phone I got this and wasted my cyber Monday deal and ended up returning this phone and having to go back to my old phone which was better than my new phone.  camera was okay, but the flash sucked and would ruin photos.  I could go on, but if anyone reads this they will see that it not worth the money..  worse part is signal sucks and I got great serves with my old phone and this phone id be lucky if my call would go through and the 3g was soooo slow. virgin mobile in my area is good but not with this phone..    Me I don&apos;t like the big phones.. What where they thinking were they trying to go retro or what."	0

"Needed a phone quickly to replace my Galaxy j7. Bought this s5 used on ebay.   This s5 is definitely much smaller in size. The battery life is bad, but could be because it's about 4 years old.  ... j7 definitely has a lot more updated and newer features which simplify the flow of the phone.  "	1

"Negative review, Negative evaluation. The seller deceived me.  Before buying the item I asked the seller if the new item was - the answer was positive. The seller sent not a new damaged phone. The phone has traces of damage and traces of a fall.  The phone has traces of bumps and falls from different sides. In the lower side, where there is damage, the touch panel does not work well. The aluminum frame has traces of bumps and falls. The charger and the USB cable are not new. On the phone there are signs of an autopsy. There is dirt under the lid. The seller  demanded a refund of money bypassing the ebay auction.  The seller wrote me on November 10, 2017:  Take your feedback back. Made it positive. And you can keep the money and the phone. Tell me what you thinking about.... Since you remove the negative feedback and put me +, I will stop the prosecution and I will   close the case. How this look to you?  The seller acknowledged his guilt with his actions.  The seller wrote me that the eBay Customer Service remove negative feedback from him, which I   left. I do not agree with this.  Negative feedback is correct. In his last letter the seller showed disrespect to me. I am very unhappy with this deal! Mike."	0
"NEGATIVE:   the battery only lasts up to 2 days of moderate or 1 day of constant use but you can easily upgrade your battery to an extended battery about $20 on e-bay in which case the battery lasts up to 4 days of moderate use or 2-3 days of consistent use. another bad part about this phone is that it&apos;s not really for people that text alot, which in my case i never do so it&apos;s not really bad for me, i just thought i should mention it.     POSITIVE:   the phone is INCREDIBLY good. this phone has awsome features which are perfect for the on-the-go person. An external micro sd card reader is so easy to access not like the others that you have to install the micro sd card behind the battery. the connection on this phone is phenomenal, it worked on the third level on a building&apos;s underground parking lot. The awsome part about this phone is that you can easily play music or watch TV whenever you want and the sound quality is amazing... i love the slide action on the phone as well as the picture quality...ohhh man. over all this phone is TRIPLE O G!!"	1

"NET10 Customer Service is often difficult to understand problems which might arise when activating these cell phones.  It is not uncommon for the refurbished cell phones not to have been completely cleared when be refurbished.  This sometimes results in the cell phone you just purchased having the previous activation and/or SIM card still being registered. You then may have an extremely difficult time in getthing the NET10 representative you talk to  understand this problem.    Many cell phone users typically pay for more minutes than they actually use.    Both NET10 and Touch Tone offer affordable cell phone plans whereby caller only pay for the minutes they actually use.    The LG 300 is a good cell phone and NET10 offers an affordable rate for the caller who typically uses less than 150 minutes or less per month.    NET10 is a straightforward pay as you go cell phone service with US nationwide coverage.    NET10 has no contracts, confusing terms, stipulations, hidden fees, small print or surcharges - plus no daily charges or monthly bills.    NET10 offers a flat rate of 10 cents per minute, with local, long distance and roaming included.    NET10 International Long Distance allows you to make calls to over 60 international destinations from your NET10 phone in the U.S., at a cost of a regular call (10 cents) plus 5 cents per minute.    NET10 International Neighbors also allows you to obtain AT NO CHARGE three Mexican or Canadian phone numbers, which your family and friends (in those countries) can dial, and you will receive those calls directly at your NET10 phone in the United States. With NET10 International Neighbors your family and friends in Mexico or Canada wont pay international long distance charges, and you will pay just a regular call. (In order to obtain your FREE NET10 International Neighbors numbers you must first register FREE to NET10 International Long Distance service, so that you can make and/or receive international long distance calls.)    I would recommend the LG 300 and NET10 services for any caller using less than 150 minutes per month.  I would, however, recommend the LG 4500 Cell Phone through Touch Tone for $9.95 per month plus $.05 per minutes as a more ecomomical rate for any caller who uses between 200 - 800 minutes per month.  Touch Tone also has no contracts, confusing terms, stipulations, hidden fees, small print or surcharges.  Touch Tone does have a monthly fee of $9.95 and only requires its customers to have a bank issued credit or debit card.    Each caller should analyze their monthly cell phone usage and choose the plan most suited for their needs.  Regardless, why pay for more minutes than you actually use when both NET10 and Touch Tone offer affordable cell phone plans whereby caller only pay for the minutes they actually use."	0

NET10 has no contracts, confusing terms, stipulations, hidden fees, small print or surcharges - plus no daily charges or monthly bills.    NET10 offers a flat rate of 10 cents per minute, with local, long distance and roaming included.    NET10 International Long Distance allows you to make calls to over 60 international destinations from your NET10 phone in the U.S., at a cost of a regular call (10 cents) plus 5 cents per minute.    NET10 International Neighbors also allows you to obtain AT NO CHARGE three Mexican or Canadian phone numbers, which your family and friends (in those countries) can dial, and you will receive those calls directly at your NET10 phone in the United States. With NET10 International Neighbors your family and friends in Mexico or Canada wont pay international long distance charges, and you will pay just a regular call. (In order to obtain your FREE NET10 International Neighbors numbers you must first register FREE to NET10 International Long Distance service, so that you can make and/or receive international long distance calls.)    I would recommend the LG 300 and NET10 services for any caller using less than 150 minutes per month.  I would, however, recommend the LG 4500 Cell Phone through Touch Tone for $9.95 per month plus $.05 per minutes as a more ecomomical rate for any caller who uses between 200 - 800 minutes per month.  Touch Tone also has no contracts, confusing terms, stipulations, hidden fees, small print or surcharges.  Touch Tone does have a monthly fee of $9.95 and only requires its customers to have a bank issued credit or debit card.    Each caller should analyze their monthly cell phone usage and choose the plan most suited for their needs.  Regardless, why pay for more minutes than you actually use when both NET10 and Touch Tone offer affordable cell phone plans whereby caller only pay for the minutes they actually use."	0

"NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM CHINA OR OVERSEAS.  EBAY&apos;S MONEY BACK GUARANTEE DOES NOT WORK!  I fell for the prmise that ebay would back up the purchases with a money back guarantee.  Not true they fail to tell you if the purchase is out of the country the burden of proof is on you to get that country to  verify the return was delieved.  I lost over $400.00 on a cell phone purchase from China.  NEVER AGAIN WILL I TRUST EBAY&apos;S MONEY BACK GUARANTEE.   I LIVE ON A FIXED INCOME AND THAT WAS A BIG CHUNK OF MY MONTH&apos;S INCOME NOT TO BE GETTING BACK AND STILL WITH NO CELL PHONE TO USE.     Ebay&apos;s money back guarantee is for the birds.  They don&apos;t tell you it only is good for returns in the US and not overseas.   They don&apos;t tell you that only applies to buys within the US.  I made the mistake of trusting their word to guarantee to refund  my money, and then they said because the shipper was outside the US, I had to prove the package was returned to China.  My post office receipt was not enough.  I&apos;ve lost over $400.00 on this bad deal and now I have to prove someone in china delivered the returned item and give them verified proof.  What a false statement to give and cause your customers to think Ebay has their back.  When in reality they won&apos;t give your money back either.  Very,  very disgusted with your company."	0

"Never ever buy from this seller as he doesn't send what he supposed to. I brought this phone and being told that it is a BRAND NEW open box phone which is being opened ONLY for unlocking it but that was not the case.  They did good job on cleanup so that you cant figure out whether it is an old phone but still you cant make the old phone as good as new one. They sent me 64GB version (vs I order 32GB) in 32GB box and I think they did intentionally so that even if I figure out this is not a new phone, I ll not make any noise coz I got more than what I ordered, smart tactics but not good one."	0

"Never receive the product!! Unpleasant buying experience! Called and checked with the seller couple times since I never receive the product; first time the seller said that products lost during delivery process, second time still havent receive the product. The seller told me to contact the UPS, when I called the UPS, it directed me back to the seller. This is absurd! The sellers not being helpful at all, not only he is not helping me to find out about what happened to the delivery of the product, but also being very rude by saying hes not going to help me , he said just dispute the charge, dont bother. What kind of attitude is this? I dont care about the money, couple of dollars, no big deal, but this attitude from the sellers very disturbing. This is not the way to do business and this is not how a seller should treat his customers. This is UNACCEPTABLE! I did get the refund, lucky me. "	0

"Never received the phone despite what seller times2sell said. times2sell sent it to the wrong address. when I e-mailed times2sell, I got the response that it was delivered at Skypost, telling me it's the parent company of Puntomio. Puntomio is the company I use to receive my packages. Puntomio never received the package. Puntomio contacted Skypost. Skypost never received the phone and the statement about R. Garcia signing for it is also false(see attachments). When I tried to get a refund of my money, you(ebay) denied it in less than an hour. So I'm putting the one star because 1) I did not receive the phone.  2) you(Ebay) missed the mark on this one.  I attached 3 pictures (response times2sell, response Puntomio and the usps tracking).  Check them for yourselves and also check my shipping address and the address for Skypost (FL 33126). My shipping address is for this phone is: 7701 NW 15th St Account # CW228996 Miami FL 33106-0001 United States."	0

"Never received the phone.  They said they sent a replacement after they asked me to leave positive feedback but nothing ever arrived. Topshelf-Wireless, Jeffery, said it was worthless to ask USPS to track the package and he would just send another phone.  That was over a month ago. Opened a dispute with Ebay.  I asked for tracking info on the replacement but never received a reply from 3 separate emails.  The phone was to be a Christmas gift but that never happened.  Made for a nice Christmas.

But Im adding to my review. This phone, people have a hard time hearing me  and I hear loud feedback to whom ever Im talking to.   Talked to Verizon and they said it could be because its an older style  phone. Which wont be useful in about a year. Due to them taking out 3G.  This phone was looked up and states 4G but its not.  That was confirmed through Verizon.   Its a 3G phone.  "	0

"New may have been a good phone. But i bought it used and when i bought a sim card and turned it on the screen was flipping irradically. And it was as if i were touching the screen w/o me touching it. It even went into the settings and changed a setting...i never touched the screen when it did that. I did turn it off and turn it back in and it didnt do that anymore. It also, closer to the edge of the screen, when i tried to text i pressed &quot;a&quot; and it would never read that i pressed anything.So i was able to get a refund."	0

Nexus s is great phone with beautiful display. Since this phone comes with latest 2.3 firmware i must say its very fast and responsive.

Nice and easy to handle                                                                                                                                               .	1

Nice cell phone. Looks almost new. Previous owner took very good care of it. One mistake was the phone still had the others persons personal and business contacts and phone numbers. Should have been erased before shipping it.	1
Nice device for that price am amazed	1
Nice doing business with you.	1
"Nice fairly new phone, just a year or so old. Big bright screen, easy to use. As low as $35-40 on eBay for nice used unlocked phones, mostly MetroPCS. I have bought several of these for family members to use with Mint Mobile. They work great all around, including wifi tethering data to a PC."	1
nice gell phone and high qulity and i recommended to use all the product of apple becuase it is the best thing	1
Nice great phone with great quality. Love it	1
"Nice idea but fail. Waste if money. Nothing in the store and you have to sign in to Microsoft to use native apps. Sometimes apps allow you to sign in, sometimes they don't. Waste of money. Camera is great, but I don't use the camera."	0
nice item as described fast   shipping good communication would recommend purchase from this seller.	1
"Nice large screen and very slim, great battery life, this phone has a quad core CPU, but only 2GB of Ram so some larger apps may lag on it, when compared to high end phones like the Galaxy 8. The battery life makes up for it and has a decent camera that works well in daylight and lighted rooms.  Dark rooms will make sub-par and burly photos. The can also be lagging when focusing."	1
"Nice little easy to use phone. My husband had a stroke and I needed something simple. I preprogrammed the speed dial so he just had to hold down one number to get to his important contacts. He can't talk  much,  so I feel safer if he is waiting on the car while I'm in a store. I know he can hold one button to notify me that he needs me. I got a red hard case, so we can find it if lost. Stays charged forever! (Compared to my smart phone)"	1
nice little phone for my grandson	1
"nice little phone, works good . The only problem we have is iphone 4 only goes to os 7.1 and apple doesn't support apps for 7.1.  A 5s would be a better choice which will be our next upgrade"	1
"Nice little phone. Yes, the menu is the &apos;same old Nokia&apos; menu, but as with all Nokia&apos;s -   a) it&apos;s simple and functional  b) it doesn&apos;t crash.     If you want a good basic clamshell phone without the problems associated with other brands - then go for it."	1
nice looking cell phones but didnt get what i order. and to top it of one of them the screen went blank. cant bother with the seller allready got my money and dont even want to answer my emails. I will never buy AGAIN	0

Nice phone will use again . fast delivery of the phone.it was packed nice and secure. had no problem with the product. I will definitely use them again	1
Nice phone with a lot of features.  The texting keyboard is nice but the keys are very small for a texting keyboard. Another issue is the keyboard is supposed to lock to prevent keys being pushed when not intended.  I found that it still was pushing keys when in your pocket or in the case when not intended.    The battery life is horrible.  I even bought a new battery thinking that might be the problem.  It still could only get 6 days before recharging the phone.  This was on standby with only a few occasional calls.  In this regard it was very disappointing.  I am used to a phone that gets at least 10 to 14 days on standby.  In an age when many phones last a month on standby it is very disappointing.  I couldn&apos;t even find a generic battery with longer battery life for this phone.	0

"Nice phone, great condition. It would make a great music player, alarm clock, flashlight or compass. However, it has no sim tray and is locked to Verizon. Verizon no longer activates 3g phones, making it worthless for that purpose."	0

"Nice strong frame. Limited Edition All black looks dope paired with a Stilgult vertical leather ultraslim. The keyboard works flawlessly. Touch sensitivity is on point. Once you get the hang of it you'll be swiping sentences somewhere between a nanosecond and a second. The camera takes good pictures. Blackberry Hub is great, not quite BB10 but works efficiently. I had to finally give up my Passport Silver. Admittedly, I've owned probably 10 BB devices since 2007. I'll just say this phone is not my Passport, but it's good enough to be my prime 2 line device for the foreseeable future. KeyThree maybe ."	1

Simple menu, very large numbers (good for people with reading problems, the display avoids reading glasses). The camera is simple but good enough to associate a image with a person.  This phone is excellent for somebody that wants just a phone and also needs reading glasses. This phone is not for a person that wants a good camera, music player or Internet access. The fit and finish is very good quality."	1

"No Manual came with the phone, so went on line and got the manual.  This phone does not match the manual, as many listed features are missing, as if the phone was an early prototype or something.  I have pictures on the SIM card that I cannot download.  Have tried everything the Motorola tech suggested.  I have even ordered a Motorola cord as Tech suggested.  Haven&apos;t received that yet.  I have Mini SD card installed, but can not load to it.  Again, a step in manual missing on phone.    Chargers that I received with phone (An AC and a car charger) do not work with this phone. I&apos;m sure the dealer did not know this was a lemon.  I don&apos;t hold him at all responsible.  I have not experienced anything like this with any other phone I have owned.

"No Phone CASE available in USA for this phone - don't buy unless you want to risk breaking your phone simply because there is literally NO CASE available on the market - even cases from china are ""wallet"" style cases - if I had known that I would NEVER have bought this phone - VERY DISAPPOINTED - I won't buy from this company again. They FAIL to even mention this is NOT a standard size phone and that not one single case will fit this phone - why are they keeping this info from you?

"No Responsibility (typical of life in America today)  To the point: I purchased this phone to make calls using WiFi. Little did I know how to make the phone work with WiFi. As it turned out, little did everyone I spoke with knew either.   I did asked questions before I purchased. After I explained, to many techs, what I wanted the phone to do, I received erroneous Intel, much of it.  I paid for parts I was told to buy and can not use or return. The gas, many hours on the phone with customer service techs, my efforts, a very serious amount of frustration, and a hoarse voice. I would say it cost me at least triple to own this phone and, here is the kicker... No One Wants To Take The Responsibility Of Giving Me The Wrong Information. Can you believe it? It's all about me...my time, my money, and it's my fault for buying the phone as well.  Even though I used my head and ask questions first... I had to pay for everyone's mistakes and erroneous Intel.  This left a very foul taste in my mouth. Any Comments?"	0

"No USB support other than it charges using the typical MICRO-usb port.  Samsung shows there are two models of this phone for Verizon: SCH-U360MAAVZW &amp; SCH-U360MASVZW.  There is a difference of about 2MB in filesize for the two versions of the user manual via Samsung, but good luck finding which model you have from the MEID HEX label inside the phone.  I had to assume I have the SCH-U360MAAVZW because the other is 404 on Verizon.  The back cover is extremely difficult to get off (tracking down which model I had so i could discover that USB drivers are nowhere to be found for this phone).  Push and hold the number 1 key for voicemail is a great feature.  The flimsy case I got with the phone is aweful; both volume controls on the left side, as well as the camera and mute buttons on the right side are blocked, but the USB port is accessible.  Bluetooth transfers are attainable if you wish to send files off the SCH-U360, but I could not get any transfers going from a smartphone (all APP-ed up) or through a D-Link bluetooth adapter."	0

"Nokia 1100 is a really good phone. It has very few &apos;features&apos;, but is robust well designed. The keypad is a decent size and the keys easy to locate, so good for texting, also splash proof. The alarm can be set to work only on week days etc, so you don&apos;t need to remember to set it, it also has a stopwatch and a countdown timer, which I use for cooking.     The most important thing for me is that the battery can sometimes go for a week without charging - because it has no unneccessary features like colour screen, camera etc. I now have 3 of these, work, personal and spare."	1
"Nokia 6085 is a well featured cellphone for an affordable price. Camera, bluetooth, radio, mp3 player, and above all, a quad band cellphone with an outstanding reception quality. The incorporated memory is quite small, but it takes a up to 2G mini SD card. All in all, a very good phone for the money."	1
Nokia 6103 was probably one of the worst phones that I have ever had number one and for most was I ordered it off and eBay from China market said the phone was brand-new when I got the phone it had no characteristics of being new at all it took 20 days to get the phone phone with statically would not die all numbers and now even with eBay trying to help get the money back two months later no money.	0
"nokia 6230i  the best nokia available  why?  fantastic battery life charge only once a week , bluetooth, camera ok for a phone,pop port.  realy easy to use would reccomend as a reliable working phone for people who have busy schedules and need good solid communications 10/10"	1

"Nokia E65 incorporates a long battery life, 3G, quad-band calling, and multiple messaging options into a slim, stylish design with dedicated One Touch keys!!!  Don&apos;t let its thin body and good looks fool you, the new Nokia E65 is all business with WiFi, push email support, and the S60 smartphone OS.    Nokia E65 Symbian smartphone that is definetely worth every penny !!!"	1
"NOKIA HAVE MADE MANY BASIC PHONES OVER THE YEARS,WHILST SOME HAVE RELIABILITY PROBLEMS SUCH AS BLEEDING SCREENS,STICKING BUTTONS,THIN,EASY TO CRACK FASCIAS ETC,THE 1101 HAS NONE OF THESE PROBLEMS,IT HAS A RUBBERY KEY PAD, A SIMPLE, EASY TO READ BLACK &amp; WHITE SCREEN AND GOOD BATTERY LIFE. WHEN THE FASCIA DOES SHOW SIGNS OF WEAR IT IS EASILY REPLACED,A QUICK DIY JOB WHICH NEEDS NO TOOLS. AS IT DOES NOTHING ELSE EXCEPT MAKE &amp; RECEIVE CALLS OR TEXTS IT HAS AN EXCELLENT BATTERY LIFE. IT COMES WITH A SMALL TORCH WHICH IS NO MORE THAN A GIMMICK.TO CONCLUDE IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR AN EASY TO USE DUAL-BAND MOBILE PHONE THAT WILL GIVE MANY YEARS USAGE THEN BUY ONE, YOU WON&apos;T BE DISAPPOINTED."	1

"Nokia N8 GPS is perfect tool. It is so friendly. It allows you to download the maps. I can check the weather, the hotels, the restaurant, and so on.  The best part I think is I can choose different language."	1
Nokia N9 is not to the expectation. It freezes most of the time after I just take one picture using the camera. It often request me to RESTART. All the applications are not accessiable apart from contacts and messages. The battery life is hopeless because is uses up just in one day on standby mode.	0
Nokia N900 has to be one of the best cell phones ever.  I bought one of these over ebay a few years ago the bad part was i ended up buying it and the keypad on the phone was a french model.    My advice to anyone buying these over ebay is contact the seller before buying it! Make sure it has a US or a keypad in your language mostly i&apos;ve only seen US versions on ebay but some sellers are selling models that are french so becareful!    Phone is very unique compared to some phones.  I use my phone for pentesting out in the field their is a public firmware called &quot;Pwnie Express&quot; which will gives you some stuff that Backtrack Linux has metasploit wireless carding software ect lots of goodies!    I believe you can get a SIM card for this phone from Metro PCS or you can it the SIM card from AT&amp;T or Sprint.  Can&apos;t think of anything else to say.	1
"Nokia only made the original model, the 6820, &amp; the replacement, the 6822 for a few years. It was a completely unique design that&apos;s never been duplicated. I had  one for a while years ago, but this was my sister&apos;s birthday present who even has the car kit in her car for this phone but after so many years it needed to be replaced. Buying a used one would probably be in no better shape then hers.  To find the newer model, the 6822, brand new was shocking. The phone was made in  2005. Even more shocking that unlike the 6820 that it&apos;s replacing it was never made for AT&amp;T, so I&apos;ve never seen one with both of the U.S. GSM bands before. Made in Finland, every one I&apos;ve ever found had the 2 international bands &amp; only 1 of the U.S. bands. To find the newer model 6822 brand new, &amp; it being the one with both of the U.S. GSM bands in it when I just happened to be looking for it is next to impossible. To spend $100.00 for a brand new phone that just can&apos;t be  bought anywhere else is special, considering a used one at $50.00 or so could be  in worse shape then the one it&apos;s replacing. Like finding a 6 year old model car  that&apos;s still at the dealer and never been sold. Truly unique."	1
"Nokia&apos;s got a rock-solid reputation for reliability, and the 6555 does not disappoint!  My mom&apos;s phone got crushed in an unfortunate accident, and she specifically requested the same phone -- a Nokia 6555.  With it&apos;s 3G capability, solid reception, durable construction (unless CRUSHED by a car -- and ONLY THE SCREEN BROKE, THE PHONE WAS USABLE!!!), and long battery life, you can&apos;t go wrong with this phone!  Nokia&apos;s have always been easy to use, as well!  Very highly recommended!!!"	1

Will probably have it looked at or the battery replaced down the road if the intermittent gets any worse.  Especially if they keep swapping out phones taken in for a simple battery replacement."	0

We sent an separate email to the seller saying we are in a hurry to get the phone and pls help to ship the phone asap.   We got notified the next day 'the item is shipped'. Great, i was so impressed by their turn-around time. But guess what? All they did is just creating a shipping label!!  4 days went by, the seller still hasn't given the carrier the item. When we called and emailed the seller a number of times asking what's going on. No response.   We ended up going to local apple store to buy the phone for my inlaws as we are running out of time.   I am very disappointed with their lack of response and failure to live up to their shipping delivery promise as advertised. "	0

"Not as easy to use as my old Motorola, but All-in-All, a pretty good phone.  I don&apos;t need all the fancy stuff, and since I unlocked mine (Call AT&amp;T and give them the IMEA number - they will give you the unlock code so you can do it while you talk...), I can use local SIM cards everywhere I go - Europe, Africa, USA, South America....  I DO miss the voice dial from my Motorola on Blue Tooth, but this one does not do voice dial at all...    Voice transmission is good with both hand-held unit mic and Jawbone Bluetooth.  Audible reception is also good, so communication is good with this phone.    It does have a browser and capabilities that I never used, so if you don&apos;t mind having a &quot;prehistoric phone&quot; (we volunteer at the local High School and are constantly amazed by the kids that have much more impressive phones than we do), it will work well for you.  I don&apos;t care about that stuff, so Mehh?!    I got a few extra phones  at a good price, so I keep one with SIM cards for everywhere I go, and save the local numbers on each one as needed.    I like it, but I guess I am pretty much Old School."	1

Not for everyone. I got mine from ebay. Overall I would say this is a decent smartphone/gps unit.     Would I recommend it? Yeah sure but personally I wouldn&amp;amp;apos;t buy this now at it&amp;amp;apos;s current going rate. 50 bucks tops.    [Update] Battery life is atrocious! The only saving grace is I own a garmin gps and this phone uses the same car charger.    [Update] Screen no longer works.	0

"Not having owned any other &quot;smart&quot; (or at least not developmentally disabled) phones, I have to make the disclaimer that I&apos;m not the most well-informed bloke on this matter. I&apos;ve been told this phone is the gateway drug to the iPhone, and I have to say I do look forward to having one of those, since I&apos;m yoked to AT&amp;T for approximately forever and the Droid thus escapes my reach.    As for the LG I do like the full touch-screen keyboard and the multiplicity of punctuation marks &amp; other symbols. As an actual telephone, it seems to work okay.  Who can tell if the dropped calls are more the phone&apos;s or the network&apos;s fault?  I didn&apos;t opt for a data plan (saving as I am my virginity for the above-mentioned iPhone), but that doesn&apos;t keep the phone from being all bored just sitting in the dark in my pants pocket and spontaneously taking me online and running up extra charges. I could just lock out the &quot;data&quot; option, but then you see I wouldn&apos;t be able to send or receive photos with my texts.  Who can live like that?   A tech support guy took me through the 3-step process to lock the phone to avoid spontaneous online forays and sudden trips to the TV shows that I could if I wanted to shell out more for.  But three steps?  Really?  Don&apos;t they know who they&apos;re dealing with?    But there&apos;s something else you should know.  I bought me a Pioneer car stereo from my LOCAL INDEPENDENT dealer--NOT a corporate big box place, thank you very much.  I opted for hands-free Bluetooth so I could comply with Cal. state law when I talk on my LG phone.  It worked okay for a short spell, then intermittently, and finally not at all.  So I went back to see the car stereo guy Al--HIM I would recommend, no sweat.  And he spent an HOUR-AND-A-HALF trying to sync up the LG to the Bluetooth--no dice.  He talked to the secret tech support guy for dealers from Bluetooth--you know, kind of like when a doctor talks to the radiologist. And you know what he found out?  That the LG can&apos;t really support Bluetooth on the Pioneer car stereo!  Which means I paid a bunch extra for Bluetooth capacity on the stereo and I can&apos;t use it!  Thanks a lot, LG"	0
Not helpful at all. i definitely don't suggest this seller. Box only.	0
Not impressed at all Every time you want to make a call from second line you have to go to settings and switch it  which is time consuming no quick future to switch between primary and secondary line  Thats why I could not keep the phone Most people who are looking to have a dual Sim  iPhone would like to have a future for  quick switch between the lines but thats not the case with iPhone  	0
"Not impressed at all with this smart phone.  The touch screen does not function well, it is cumbersome to get to texting mode, the e-mail set up is not very user friendly.  I thought this would be much nicer, oh well.  It works and I will make do for now."	0
Not impressed. I have all ways prefered Nokia phones but this one is not that great. The charger input is flimsey and its only been 4 days and I all ready have to fiddle with the cord for it to start charging. You can just tell that it is not that durable as far as cell phones go. Get what you pay for I guess.	0
not indicate the seller. after the auction he said he would not send my product if I do not send more money. I paid 435 for the product is 520 he wanted !! and refused to ship the product !! extremely disappointed !!! did not honor the commitment !!	0
"Not JD but a review anyway, had the 3s then the 4s & now got the iPhone 5s, I cannot fault these phones other than to say only three things I would change that I think would make them better and they would be: 1. Add a memory card slot 2. Built in wi wifi battery charging and 3. Solar power charging  (Possibly using the back of the phone as a solar panel)"	1
Not knowing it didn't come with a SIM card I have been having problems finding the right card.  I've been without cell service up to this time. Today I will go to Walmart to see if they can help me out.  Virgin Moble should have their own store and NOT be in a big box store.	0
Not like new condition. Locked to his iTunes account. Screen is crap. Can't use it. Extremely unhappy.	0
"Not long ago the 5s was the gold standard, still the bomb!!  Value beyond compair. If you don't have to have the newest!!"	1
"Not made for the US market; made for some Muslim country.  Phone has imbedded settings for prayer times in some 20 Muslim cities, it shows the direction of Mecca, and it does not have the standard languages such as German, Italian, Chinese and Portuguese. I have still to verify if it has all 4 wavelengths are advertised.   It does support English and French languages.   Supplier did clients a great disfavor by not listing the above features so that they can decide by themselves whether they wish to be burdened forever with the undesired features. Since I left for Brazil soon after the phone was delivered, I could not return it.   For this lack of information, I would rate the seller a 2."	0
Not many options when the phone companies continue to screw you over. My other option was to spend 600.00 Not really an option	0
"Not Motorola best effort at all. The phone has alot of problems, display is not going to hold up, flip part will break if you look at it, good luck on getting it to charge, and the cut down battery Motorola came up with for this model is junk!!!!!sound is better if you just lay the phone down and yell at whoever your trying to call, get use to seeing the NO SERVICE screen. this is not based on one phone, we refurbish phones for years now, this is based on the 1000&apos;s we got of this model T720-T730 CDMA and GSM models. Save your money, buy something better. You want a cheap phone buy a Motorola V60 or a Nokia, buy something that works, this model has more problems than I can count."	0

Not only do they not answer any of your messages I have literally just saw on eBay message them 17 times this phone doesn't charge no matter what charger you could possibly put on it everything is so screwed up from talk texting to the battery to the entire system only 10% of his phone works properly and God forbid you try to get help from them good luck by the way they actually have the balls to contact you three times in a row on a Sunday morning in less than 45 minutes but they're closed and it's an automated system which means some geek can fix that but I know they won't not to mention when you actually call during normal business hours I have called 27 times and left 27 messages during normal business hours and all you get is all customer service representatives are busy right now please hold for the next one and then two seconds later they make you leave a message and nobody at all we'll ever get back to you I have dealt with some real nasty people on this eBay site but these people are not even the cake or the candles there the Flames that get blown out they could give to schitts less it's almost like they want to sit on their ass and collect their food stamps and cash assistance so do yourselves a favor and save yourself the stress and the crap and keep scrolling cuz not 	0
"Not only is the device not able to be activated, it isnt recognized as a S4 at all. The IMEI number matches a Galaxy S3 that was still on another account.

Buyers beware."	0

Very difficult to put pictures in folders, and then to find them when they are. No flash. Indoor pictures are dark.  Contact list will not open without going thru at&t address book. In other words, contact list will not immediately open up.  WILL NOT SEND NOR RECEIVE pictures thru text messaging, (MMS).  Battery life is not that good.  No comment on data plans. I got phone just for talk, text, & picture taking.  I reckon that is why it is only a $40 phone.  "	0

"Not too many features but this is a very reliable phone. Theres no screen damage on mine after a year of use through everyday work, yet my new razor already has defects in the screen. Dropped it a few times, works great, didnt even crack. Overall great basic phone."	1
"Not tough at all, first time I dropped this NEW phone 2ft the back popped off and battery flew out &quot;it will  happen every time&quot; The company I bought it from was great but this fone is terrible. I wish I found my old LGT300 (I think thats what it was) You could drop it from 8ft high, it would just bounce, no big deal. I dropped it thousands of times. It was so easy to use. You didn&apos;t have to go through different settings to see your recent received calls, just to call them back. Claims to have technology to hear in loud spaces. You can barely hear it in a quite room and I have great hearing. Barely makes any noise when your pressing buttons so you better be watching that screen. The  only thing I like about it is the ringer gets Really loud. If the ringer gets loud enough for a 100 year old, then why can&apos;t you turn the talking phone up much. Don&apos;t buy it for $5.00 Spend $30+ and get something that will work good for you and make you happy. I just got it and I&apos;m going to look for something else."	0

"Not withstanding the phone I ordered off ebay, these phones are tanks. Tuff, rugged looking and good battery life. It seems to work best on 3G as Sprints network (LTE) isn&apos;t the best and is slower at times then 3G. Direct connect works great with the 1 person I know that has it. Battery, if you don&apos;t load a bunch of apps that requires updating every 15 minutes, you can get 36 hrs out of this phone. If your like me and have the weather running, texting about 20-50 texts a day and maybe a 30 minute phone call, then you will get 24-36 before you need to charge it back up. I wish is had more internal memory as it seems to run out kinda fast but you can add and remove apps as you see fit.   Pros: Tough, water proof (not resistant but proof)        Really LOUD speaker        Battery life        Runs all the apps I&apos;ve tossed at it, unlike my Samsung S4  Cons: Speaker so loud sometimes it rattles        Sprint network        The white wears off the keys after a year"	0

Not worth for money !  1. The iphone 5C displayed in this seller's site is marked 'brand new' and the picture displays headfone included. However I didn't find a headphone while opened the box that I received 2. The charging cable says 'Designed in Apple California' however it has visible scratches and signs of usage and is a second hand. 3. The cell phone looks good and loads the software but performance is low and taking too much time to charge and battery drain too fast.	0

Note 5 is a great phone 	1
"Note 8 is absolutely stunning. Super fast processor, snappy graphics, with S-pen that makes the overall experience wonderful. Hands down the best Android phone ever made. "	1
"Note 9 is one of the best Android devices found even still at middle 2019. S10's are on the go and we are expecting the glorious Note 10, but, for the moment, this 6''plus screen is one of the best devices you can get.  As everything from a predefined device, has some flaws, like the curved screen having some light bouncing to the very edge of the screen glass at peak luminance, and the fact that is an all-glass sandwich, wich requires some care on choosing screen protectors, and a hard case.   Besides all of that, the phone is a generous monster machine, at base specs of 128gb internal storage with extra Memory slot, 6gb of RAM, the super calibrated AMOLED screen, the famous S-Pen with now Bluetooth capabilities and color signature, a whooping 4k mhz battery and fast charging that works with 15W adapters, charging the phone from 0% to 100% in less than 2 hours.   Its a great all round device, and I'm expecting it to last some good years. "	1
note item was sent missing the carcharger as described in listing . misrepresented . i was cheated . lied to and ripped off .....	0
Note series phones are always a great weapon. These phones do lots without lagging. I've owned all except the 8.  	1
Note these phones are notorious for charger connection failures.  The pin becomes worn/loose and it is near impossible to charge this phone.  I had owned two of these phones which had the same problem.  The next generation Doro 618 uses a different charger connection because of all the problems the 410 charger connection had.	0
"Note to all customers: I bid on this item and set my max bid to purchase to ensure I would win the item. The item auction ended at 5 am where I am from and 8 am where the seller is from. At 5 am when the auction ended I was still asleep, when I woke up for work around 8 am I promptly logged into my account to pay for the item. Ebay let me know I had won the item and it needed to be paid within 48 hours. This is the usual golden standard for an auction item. Once I clicked 'pay seller' it showed me that the item had been canceled. The sellers note was listed due to: You don't need to do anything else.' Just as I was going to message the seller to see what happened to confirm if it was an accident that had occurred the seller sent me a private message calling me inconsiderate and telling me when making a purchase to make the payment. Again I would like to mention that Ebay allows for 48 hours for the auction item to be paid before anything else. I wrote the seller back explaining the time difference and Ebays policy when purchasing an auction item. Shortly after the seller messaged me back saying ok! Have a good day!.   Since then I have gotten in contact with Ebay customer support to notify them of the rude message I received from the seller as well as the dishonest auction that o"	0

"Oh my god!!! Worst phone ever.  So my plan was to upgrade from an iphone 4 up to something that they were calling the iphone killer....I think nokia lumia slapped iphone in the face and iphone punched its lights out. Overall the phone was horrible. Besides the actual body style of the phone being beautiful, the software was junk...Although it had minimal ups in there. I liked how they integrated their contacts and their mail. Although there is no way to organize mail and put them into its sub folders. The phone was slow. People had said it was nice and responsive...Well not this one for some reason.  It might be broke i dont know. The phone was very slow and sometimes it would freeze up on me a lot. I was having to wait a lot.  The apps really did suck. There was a few i liked so far. I havent been through all of them. But i thought city search was a very neat app for any phone system. The photos looked nice but they were just pictures..Who cares if they are a little better or the same as iphone or samsung s3. They all come out great if you ask me in any platform. There was no full battery percentage showing..just the battery thing showing its going down but no percentage...Although there was apps. The apps did not continue to show live battery feed. You had to open it to find out. I liked the toggle app..Great app to keep wifi bluetooth in the main screen...loved it. i also love the fact that i can organize a bunch of the actual tiles i like in just the front page. But its dull and boring. If i could do that with a large enough screen it would be bad ass on an iphone. I also liked that you can swipe back to the last screen you were using...Thats really neat. For some reason my speaker sound it like poop. I dont know if it was the phone or all of them. Volume rocker placement was good. But it was odd that when you change volume to watch a video and you higher or lower the volume the volume of the ringer also changes...The vibration mode sucked for the phone. Could barely even feel them...And if you turned on the phone to vibrate then there was no sound or vibration when you texted or anything. even if i have my phone on vibrate for phone calls i wanna be able to hear sound if im pressing the keys.  There was only three dimming styles to save battery life. Unlike iphone which has 0 to 100 percent. choose at will. Music from nokea was good.  Marketplace was random and you get lost even with the few apps they had.  I love the feel and durability of the phone. Even the heavy weight was wonderful...Only girls want smaller phones...This felt like a mans phone. Although people that wrote that phone gets hot are absolutely correct.  The usb they sent me to charged the phone didnt quite seem to fit right for some reason as it made a click everytime..I dont think that sounded good. And it didnt quite go all the way in. The battery did stay on for a long time. But i think only because it goes to standby after one minute per my settings and the background is black and only a few things show colors except when youre on the internet. I think they purposely did that to save battery.  I loved the fact that the phone was compatible with straight talk service. Very easy to change both the apn and mms settings on the phone. Even without it being unlocked. As long you are using the at&amp;t towers you are good. Straigh talk thus offer both tmobile sim cards and at&amp;t sim cards. Although the body of the phone was very well designed the sim card tray seemed cheap"	0
Oh my husband loves it! Very smart choice that I made when I purchased this phone!!!!!!!!!! The signal is awesome too! You can not go wrong with one of these phones.	1

"ok I do have a lot to say about my experience with this purchase.Firstly I was looking for a valentine&apos;s day present, this didn&apos;t happen. We got the phone and it seemed ok for the first couple of days. Then we experience 4 major faults..1 The phone was not charging up fully..2 The phone got red hot in her handbag..3 After 5-10 minutes use the phone was drained of all power..4 Whilst charging the charger burnt out it started smoking I can only thank God she was awake...I am extremely disappointed we could have experienced deadly consequences. And to top it of the return label on the package is not where it came from. How I chose this company was because they were recommended by eBay with 99.1% Trustworthiness. She is not happy about it and it has caused arguments because there is a baby in the house and the money and time its going to take recovering my money."	0
"ok it don&apos;t work well with my network and it doesn&apos;t work with my computer, I tried to register it online but could not find the webpage. I also could not put music on there.

But I am keeping it for my back up phone in case my other one I got gives out or gets lost."	0

"Ok the title was click bait but you need to hear this. BUY THIS PHONE NOW  Cons: the charger I got was broken when I got it (the cord was fine but plug part was wonky, like I would plug it to the wall and it would turn my phone screen on and off, luckily I just used my HTC plug and it worked perfectly fine)  It didn't come with the thing you need to open the Sims card so I just used a needle and it popped out perfectly.  Pros is EVERYTHING, the shipping was perfect and fast, I ordered it on a Friday and it came that Tuesday, the Package was packed securely, so secure that it took me forever to open it, the phone is basically in mint condition.

OK this phone first off is extremely tacky it is this horrible golden orange color. The phone looks like a cave wall with inscribes and carvings on it. The camera is horrible reminds me of the v710 from motorola but even worse(can u believe that!?!?!) The phone is a cingular phone I tried it out in a cingular phone store in China Town New York. Horrible Phone don&apos;t even waste your time buying it.    Pro: The screen is pretty decent but nuttin spectacular.  Video is better than camera which is kinda weird.(probably because of video ringtones which is pretty cool)    Cons: Everything is bad about the phone.  Crappy stereo speakers  Camera worse than motorola v710  Cool rotating thing to open phone but design and color is horrible.	0
"Ok,  First, I am a dinosaur - I have been a BlackBerry user for my entire cell phone life.  I have been laughed at, derided, and have missed out on the ""Cool"" apps.  That changed with the BB PRIV.  What an awesome phone.  BB functionality, Form, keyboard - with the benefit of the COOL APPS. Sorry tp see that Verizon stopped carrying this phone.  Happy to have it and proud to show it off!   Thanks!"	1
"ok, be honest, this phone is a dissapointing. its a refurnished phone, however, the phone its self still has the previous owner&apos;s contact numbers. and, there is networking problem with this phone. after i get a replacement from the buyer(takes 2 weeks to get thing done:(  ), the new one seems fine. however its not! the paint of the phone start to fade,,and theres problem with the mic...others hardly can hear my voice. i spend like 70 dollars for this one but what do i get? btw, the battery comes with it is not OEM and it sux...i need to recharge it EVERYDAY. and the phone manual is rediculus. the cover is t39m while the inside content is a t10! what can i say?"	0
"OK, First of all, I do not want this to reflect badly on the seller. On the contrary, The seller in this case went above and beyond his obligations in this matter. What I am mainly trying to convey, is the technical view of this transaction. I bought this phone with 300 minutes upon activation for around $16.00(shipping was $5.80) so all tolled, it was going to cost me about 7.3 cents a minute to use this phone. Well I normally pay about 9 cents a minute so I thought I would save a little. Well, the phone arrives in a timely manner all packaged well and I was very pleased. I go to activate the phone, (which I have done many, many times)  and there is a problem. So I call net10 and they get the phone activated, but with no minutes. Net10 gives me a lame explanation as to why no minutes and I contact my Ebay seller. This seller is very helpful and sends me another phone! It too arrives quickly and I try to activate it and Net10 tells me the sim card is not compatible to my calling area, so I request them to send me a new sim card which they are eager to do.(HEY, if you don&apos;t START using their phone, you won&apos;t BUY any more airtime from them, right?) Well I finally get the phone activated, with the 300 minutes, but with some goofy area code I have never heard of, and when I try to call it from my home landline, naturally, they say it is a long distance number. Then. I ship the first phone back to the seller. which is now no good to him either, because it has already been activated,, and it costs me $5.95. End of story goes like this: I have now spent two weeks of my time, $28.00, and a 20 mile trip to the post office to get what I could have gotten on my old cell phone in 5 minutes on the computer for $2.00 less. Plus, a very honest and helpful seller is out two phones, nearly $12.00 in shipping, and a lot of time and trouble, all for the $22.00 I paid him. So... Winners... NET10 because they always win..and the U.S.Postal Service. Losers.... A wonderful Ebay seller just trying to make an honest buck...and myself, just trying to save one!"	0

"Ok, here we go, here&apos;s the quote from the description: &quot;A key distinctive design element in the Nokia 8910 is its attractive titanium casing.&quot;  It&apos;s not metal, it&apos;s plastic!   I&apos;m so disappointed! If I could change my feedback, I would leave a negative one!  Anyway, the key feature of this phone for me was it&apos;s housing msde of metal!. I can buy 1202 not the 8910 to get a cheap s**tty phone!    European charger plug is only an extender, charger is not original, cheap chinese s**t!      I&apos;m VERY disappointed! But got what I paid for, I think."	0
"Ok, it is a cheap 3G flip phone which will do the job but it is very very basic.  Probably why no manual comes with it.  My wife was using an old Nokia flip phone and the difference in quality is night & day. The opening jingle is embarrassingly loud - the only fix is to put it in meeting mode! Texting is a real pain.  My wife hates it and I will be getting her an upgrade. "	0
"OK, so this phone was stated to be ready to activate with Straight Talk with the SIM card enclosed!! Well its not!! I like the phone I just would like to activate the damn thing ! So Now I have to order a new SIM card wait for it to arrive then hope its the correct Card and hopefully activate the phone I received 2 weeks ago !!   And to tell you the TRUTH I wish I had never ordered It from this place, BIUT IT WAS TYHE ONLY ADD THAT STATED A READY TO USE STRAIGHT TALK PHIONE WITH NEEDED SIM CARD, YEAH MY ASS!!"	0
"Ok. I had this phone on Verizon for the first phone (V325i) and it was excellent. Every feature worked great. So when I got a silver version of this phone from a family member I believe it was the v323xi? But it had horrible battery for the second phone, couldn;t send or recieve pictures and almost all of the time I got a message back saying that My message had been delivered. I was so happy to switch back to my Jest phone. At first this runs great/but getting it again is a big no no. But it is a very durable phone. For that I think it deserves SOME credit"	0
ok. look... there are so many problems with this phone i will just get to the point... i DO NOT RECCOMEND THIS PHONE TO ANYBODY. LOOK FOR A DIF. CELL	0
"Ok. So i got this phone for backup or idk. The phone is awesome. This phones carrier is US CELLULAR. The only reason that it would be a 3.5 is because once and awhile the touch stops.    PROS:  2.0 camera  amazing touchscreen *when it works*  onscreen keyboard.    This phone is basically an LG Shine but with a full touch screen for the whole top sliding panel. My main issue with the phone is the screen, nothing calibration to the screen won&apos;t fix, I just have to do it every time I want to use it. The phone has a solid feel to it as well.    The features are a 5.0 and i love them but for the screen going out, I just have to rate it based off everything"	0
"Ok. This was my first time ordering anything off of EBay. In the description of this phone the  seller stated the camera didn't work and the phone had scratches(in the pictures that were posted) so AFTER I made the purchase the seller told me ""Also, you do know that the phone is financed and it can't work under Sprint""  Well how am I supposed to know that if it was NOT in the description?!?!!! This seller has not been responding back to any of my messages and I'm extremely upset about it!!! I thought this was a good seller because the reviews were good BUT my experience was TERRIBLE!!! Did a claim with my bank and still awaiting on a response from the seller. VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!"	0
"Okay DO NOT purchase anything from this guy, when I received the phone my sim card would not work, so I went to several different other cell stores like metro, and at&amp;t, and they tried inserting there sim card and nothing would work, which would mean that the phone is either not unlocked or just does not work. Also in the title it says 32 GB, the phone only had 7 GB, that is a crazy gap between stated memory and given, then I tried working out a refund telling him i would return the phone, but he would not agree even though there was a clear false advertising from his end. I opened up a case with ebay and ended up winning, which was not a difficult win considering the clear inaccuracy of phone details."	0
"Okay I just had to write a review because I was going to replace this 7 year old phone when I got a free insurance replacement, only to find out this phone is better than most new phones! Yeah it&apos;s only 3G but the kicker is the wifi is 150mbs! yeah 150, not 15, that means you don&apos;t need 3G or 4G for internet use. If you don&apos;t have access then this phone may not be for you, but I have access on the train, at the coffee shop, restaurants and if I&apos;m at someone&apos;s house with no reception I can just turn on the wifi calling. An impressive way to test the ability of this phone is go into the youtube app and turn on the camcorder, then take a video and upload it, it will upload as fast as a laptop. If you don&apos;t go into the youtube app and record a video too long it wont upload though, the app stops it, but then you can just make clips. The camera takes high resolution pics that you can use as a desktop background on a 27&quot; LCD monitor, the only catch is they have to be in day light or a room lit like daylight, because there is no flash and low light pics suffer, same with the camcorder. This phone has a dual microphone which means you hear everything and they hear you, especially on speaker phone. I could put this phone on speaker while I was cooking and they didn&apos;t even know they were on speaker. The android 2.0 is also the least glitchy they say and with a 32GB SD card you&apos;re right up there with the top new phones for storage. I could load albums of music and with some good tube headphones the frequency response is phenomenal, never needed an ipod at the gym with this phone in an armband. I have to admit I&apos;m in the habit of using this size keyboard which only a few other phones have, but it&apos;s efficient because you can text from the palm of your hand and a thumb which is good for inopportune times. I also love the size which fits in a shirt pocket or even the front pocket of pants. Some reviews say the battery life is terrible, but what they don&apos;t tell you is all phones come with an extended battery which only adds about 2mm of thickness to the bottom half of the phone and keeps the phone charged all day. The extra battery is also convenient if your battery ever does die without a charger around because it holds a charge. Another great thing about this phone is it has a track pad on the back if your fingers are ever too dirty to use the screen. I never had a problem with the touch screen in 7 years and the only reason insurance replaced it was the keyboard light went out so I couldn&apos;t see the keys in the dark, but could still use the touch keyboard. The phone is solidly built and I like the rubberized plastic that seems to bounce and I have dropped it countless times and it was never damaged or flew apart like my Blackberrys did. If Motorola came out with this phone just the way it looks with all the new features of their best phones I think Blackberry would go out of business and I would have one perfect phone."	1
Okay I ordered a 5s Iphone it came two weeks after they promise. Also they stated it was unlock for  T-mobile that wasn't the case as well. I notified Pay Pal it appear that theses folks are fraudulent.	0
"Okay so this Samsung phone was refurbished, next to new right? WRONG, well I&apos;ve had my phone since the ninth of this month-8 days now....and my volume is not working, all that it will do is vibrate, so I&apos;m thinking that something was wring with the volume from the start and that&apos;s what was supposedly being fixed or refurbished. luckily this happened within the thirty days of activation or that the warranty covered........although now I have to go through this long process of getting another"	0
"Okay The nokia N93 a Great phone IT is the next generation phone for real. This phone has a 3.2 mega pixel camera and the lens are made by Carl Zeiss Many of you have heard of this particular lens many haven&apos;t Most sony cameras lens are made by carl zeiss. The video quality to this phone is great picture perfect!! The best part of this phone is that you can flip it anyway you want!! the widescreen view is the best view you can put MP4 movies in the phone and watch it all your favortie sitcom and movies can be loaded into the memory and you can watch it on the phone I used the TV OUT ALL THE TIME it is so clear you will be surprised All this is comming from a phone. When the phone rings there will be a electronic voice saying the persons name calling you. The flash is bright and you can control everything just like a regular camera. This phone has so much features including Radio, and you can listen to MP3 nokia throws in a 512 memory card too. The call quality is crisp you can hear everything perfect. The best part is that the ring tone is loud so and the vibrate is strong so when you are in a very noisy area you will defintely feel the vibrate or hear the ringtone. So anyone who plan on getting this phone get it, it is worth every penny trust me check the nokia website before you buy it read all the features and see if you like it yourself if you dont believe me."	1
Okay this phone is a awesome andriod phone too buy wonderful wide touch screen and great speaker the only thing would of made this phone better if it came with flash.	1

"Old phone, and all that implies.  I bought a few really cheap old phones, figuring one must be good for the price.  I&apos;d go with the K9 instead if you&apos;re interested in having an old phone.  Maybe the K10 Deluxe.  I haven&apos;t tried it yet, but it seems like a nice step up."	0

"Older phone, However I do not like contracts so this was a great buy since it is a quad core 2gb of ram with 32gb of storage, The camera doesn&apos;t blow you away but I paid only $180 new so who can complain!I would recommend this device over models such as the Moto X xt1060 simply because the Moto X is only a dual core device and having owned it I can tell you the speaker quality isn&apos;t that great and even thought the camera is 10MB I found it to be the same quality as the HTC One M7. Also of note is that this device is light, like I forget it is there. Probably a good idea to buy a UAG case to go with it as they are prone to display damage."	1
"Older phone, no GPS as far as I know, so Verizon seems to strongly discourage using this phone, but it works with some prepaid plans, such as CallWave.  Not sure but it might work with PagePlus prepaid cellular too.  Both of these are about the cheapest prepaid plans (for basic service) that you can get for the Verizon CDMA network.  Note that CallWave will sell you this phone refurb&apos;d for 9.95 shipping with a wall charger and initial 60? minutes prepaid on their plan, then $8 a month.  I am still using mine now, 10 months later.  I have a friend who also uses this phone and he is still month-to-month with Verizon, not prepaid."	1

"on 1/6/2015 I spoke with Sony at CES Show. Bottom Line: They are aware that numerous seller are offering counterfeit Sony Z2 and other model smartphones. These may have once been new Sony phones but have been repaired and modified by people who don't know what they're doing. End result is a phone that falls apart (back fell of, magnetic charger didn't work, entire phone died within 2 days. The counterfeit boxes are larger than a real Sony Box. That's clue #1. Then you compare the serial # inside in the phone settings to one on the box. If they are not identical, you have a counterfeit. "	0
"On a plus side, I received it a few days before the expected delivery. On the bad side, the phone will not register a SIM card. The SIM card slot was messed up. One of the small prongs were broke. I did message the seller but have received no reply yet.  "	0
"On body it has model SM-G930FD looks like Samsung SM-930F but all body is cheap plastic and don't have steel frame like real Galaxy s7, it has different back camera, and front glass like from galaxy s6 but very low quality plastic and paint. If you will check its menu you will see different model number SM-G935F like Galaxy S7 Edge, but menu is different and very slow. So it's very low quality fake phone with Samsung sign. I don't recommend this bad copy to anybody! :("	0
On delivery of this mobile phone I could not get into it as it was &quot;PAssword Protected&quot; I emailed the seller &amp; he sent me 3 codes to try. None of these opened my phone &amp; now have purchased a completly useless mobile !!!!!!! Still to this day he has not got back to me &amp; got this mess sorted. Keep well away from him in future. :(	1

"On July 14, 2010 I purchased 2 razr Motorolla&quot;unlocked&quot; AT&amp;T phones from Sell-Cellphone of China. It took about 2 weeks to receive the phones and by then we were really excited about our new purchase. Unfortunately even after spending about 3 or 4 hours on the phone with AT&amp;T tech folks and a couple of store visits we never could get the phones to update the time, send or receive email or pictures, download ring tones, etc. One of the phone failed right away and the only way to hear with it was to use the speakerphone. The phone were returned and it has now been a little over 2 weeks since we mailed them back and we still have not received the full refund we were promised."	0
"On June 15, 2017 my phone suddenly started heating up after I charged it for like 15-30 mins because the battery was low. I didn t mind it at the time, but it just started heating up every time I charge it. I tried turning my phone off and then charge to see if there is a change in the issue, but nope. It always feels so hot on the back of the phone. This is with the case on the phone. Yesterday June 18, 2017. I was around the house and suddenly wanted to text my friend real quick and the phone does not turn on. I don t like this product. I am going to return it and buy a better one"	0

"On receiving the phone, I charged it, but it would not power up. I took it to a Blackberry repairer who advised me that the phone was a refurbished phone and that it had a lot of issues. I had to pay an additional $56 to get the phone repaired. I bought the phone as a NEW phone not a refurbished phone, therefore, I am very disappointed in the purchase. I would be very reluctant to make any further purchases from ebay."	0
"On Sep, 9th I ordered the phone got delivered on Sep,13th. The phone had few scratched and I was still fine with it but the battery is not lasting long it is getting discharged in few hours and to get charged full it takes many hours. I am not happy with the phone. "	0
"On the bright side, FaceTime video calls are fantastic, likely because there&apos;s no cellular signal involved (you&apos;re limited to WiFi calling). Video and audio are great, it&apos;s easy to switch between front/rear cameras and landscape/portrait orientation in the middle of a call, and the narcissist in me loves flicking the preview window from corner to corner instead of paying attention to the person I&apos;m FaceTiming with. Apple was incredibly smart to make video calling &quot;just another button&quot; in the standard phone interface, making it much easier to place a video call on an iPhone than a comparable Android device"	1

I wish it was otherwise. "	0

"Once I found Samsung Galaxy phones I have never used another phone. The camera is great, processor is fast, and the screen is a great size. I like the slim look and that it is lightweight. Samsung for life."	1

One cant say the phone is even used before. Thank you for your trustworthy business. 	1
"One of My favorite mobile,perfekt size, the bad thing is ,no more updates ,and very little apps  to find beacuse ovistore no more exict "	1
One of nokias leading phones that has style and performs very well.  I also run tom tom off this as it has a nice large screen yet still is not as bulky as some of the phones currently on the market.These tend to take a good knock without causing any hassle as it has pop off pop on covers easily available from ebay.  The battery life is excellent on these phones unlike the n95 which you seem to be forever charging.  Overall recommended to anyone considering buying one of these as they were initially a network 3 phone but can be bought from phone shops unlocked as you maybe aware some get caught out unlocking 3 phones and you lose all the main functions.  Definitely buy a unlocked one and you will have no problems 5 stars from me.	1
"one of the best android phones that has ever been produced. The galaxy phone that started it all...I had the s2, s3, and now the s4. This phone is what brought me to android and samsung...and also the phone that made me decide to STAY with android and samsung."	1
One of the best Bluetooth flip phones I have owned.    Sharp style and easy to you even as a mini PDA.    Chrome surfaces front and back will scratch fairly easy if your not careful setting it down.	1
One of the best buys I&apos;ve ever made.   Battery life is amazing. 2 weeks and still going strong. I&apos;ve paid $75 or more for lesser phones. If you ever need a basic phone.. this is the best.	1
one of the best flip phones	1
one of the best mobile phones i had from sony and it&apos;s really excellent even the features and use. had little trouble when i first installed music and photos in the phone but now every thing&apos;s ok.	1
"One of the best music phones i have owned. Nokia makes good quality phones great for calls, texting and games"	1
"One of the best no nonsense cell phones period. Not tons of gizmos that you DO NOT NEED REALLY and that drain your battery faster than you can imagine. This phones got a fine camera great battery life and great reception, THATS WHAT I BOUGHT A CELL PHONE FOR NOT TO PLAY GAMES,VIDEO GADGETS THAT ARE GOOD FOR ENTERTAINING A 5YEAR OLD AND COMPUTER FUCTIONS THAT ARE NOT UP TO THE ABILITIES OF MY LAPTOP!!"	1
one of the best non-touchscreen phones for me. I used to have Shadow than switched to HTC Touch Pro and came back to the Shadow because of its design.	1
One of the best phone out there and this is a deal you can refuse!!! Everything is new like i was told by Monster809...	1
"One of the best phones ever made ... perfect size ... not to big and unwieldy, and not too small so you have to squint to see things on the screen. "	1
One of the best phones from Motorola. But it&apos;s not like the display. TFT screens or LSD is much more pleasant for me. Quality performance at a very high level. I&apos;m a fan of this brand!	1
One of the best phones I ever had I had two of them since they come out never really had a problem the battery lasts at least all day excellent value for the money I now upgraded to the Zenfone 4 max..	1
"One of the best phones I have ever owned, once you go apple you never use android again......"	1
one of the best phones I&apos;ve ever owned. Does everything I want in a phone with speed and efficiency.	1
"One of the best phones I&apos;ve had.  It has an extra long battery life.  I charged it up the first time and didn&apos;t have to charge it again for 3 days.  The VZ Navigator doesn&apos;t work the greatest, but overall it&apos;s rugged design makes this a great phone."	1
"one of the best phones i`d ever buy! easy to use,great signal power, music and camera w/ flash!!, i wish the speaker sound louder but, it`s a great,great product!!"	1
One of the best phones out there and almost meets the new 7. You won't be sorry. Great price too.	1
"One of the best products that i had recived in a while, flawless, just as described, and it LOOK like new! I hope we can keep doing business"	1
one of the best seller on ebay... thank you.	1
"One of the best smartphones for low price.   It&apos;s fast and easy to handle, it has a big screen.  The screen is bigger than the screen of iPhone 4.  Only...it&apos;s processing speed is a little lower, but it&apos;s OK :)"	1
one of the best!!!!!!	1
One of the bests android phones ever!	1
"One of the easiest reviews to write. The build or overall construction of the Blackberry 9810 is solid and of very high quality. Most of the construction is metal and rubber. The buttons feel great and solid even with large fingers. The glass is clear and seems to resist scratching even when in your pocket with other items. Battery life is excellent and re-charge every couple of days. The operating system is fluid and without flaw, clear precise graphics, nice large screen which is touch or with the use of the mouse pad which is also perfect in construction. The apps load fast and multi-tasking is super easy. Email and messaging is the best on the market and is what made Blackberry the choice for business.     Originally purchased to work and has become my most dependable solid phone as of yet. When I travel I use the built in WiFi to stay connected. Unlocked my phone so I can use any sim card which is nice about GSM phones. Built in memory is great but you can also expand it with a card. Video and photographs are more than sufficient to get the point across.     The torch is already a few years old but has aged with grace, still has all the features and social media you need to keep in contact. Pop mail is super easy to set up and Blackberry takes care of configuring it all. All in all this is a perfect phone."	1
one of the most versatile and economical phones to date from none other than lg you guys at lg rocks keep up the good work i just bought the 4400 for my girl friend and she loves it never cuts out crystal clear reception and a very good Power saver option this one is a cant miss *****!!!!!!!	1
"One of the only Virgin Mobile Phones that can still be used for both Paylo and Beyond Talk Plans maximizing your plan flexibility. Just a cool, vintage Virgin Mobile phone that gets me all misty eyed thinking about the good &apos;ole days when phones were merely for talk and text. You can install Opera Mini and Google Maps thus increasing the usability of the phone like if you need directions or need to access your email or to look up something on the internet. I love the fact that it can get on the internet and is so tiny and cute w/ the slider feature that it hides easily in one&apos;s pocket. I love it. The only issues are the calculator only goes to the hundredths decimal place (Mantra goes to the ten thousandths), there is no zoom on the camera (Mantra has a post picture zoom feature) and sometimes the texting can be a little cumbersome when using the space key b/c you have to press it twice to get it to space once (Mantra space key only needs to be pressed once per space), but the phone looks so cool, and the slider feature is so slick and awesome that that in itself makes up for the aforementioned lagging features. I just kinda wish it had the exact features that the Manta has. The Mantra I feel is a better made phone because it&apos;s made in Korea whereas the Slash is made in China (both by Samsung), but I love them both. The Mantra I feel also has a brighter screen and it is a little larger. I actually have both phones and just swap them whenever I feel like changing it up a little bit. Sometimes I want to use the flip, other times the slider. I love the Slash though. Still a very relevant and cool phone for Virgin Mobile. I wish they still sold them. This and the Mantra are the coolest phones on the market even today, but I&apos;m a minimalist with whom these phones fall in line wih my paradigm that phones are primarily for talk/text with some light internet access and other features like camera and bluetooth. It has everything I need. I just wish I was able to download more ringtones and wallpaper since I refuse to purchase them. Both Slash and Mantra have only a very few stock ringtones, wallpapers etc so I just take pictures and set them as my wallpaper, but as far as the ringtones go, they are cool, but so few of them so you&apos;re pretty much stuck w/ stock as I haven&apos;t figured out a way to download free ringtones as it blocks those sites that I&apos;ve tried. It seems like you&apos;d have to pay for the ringtones and wallpapers directly from Virgin Mobile, and that I don&apos;t like. But, like I said, I won&apos;t pay for them anyway, and I can live w/ the stock stuff so it&apos;s all good.  Great, cool-looking, easy to carry, hide and use phone. Great job Samsung. They just don&apos;t make &apos;em like this anymore like many great things, but cell phones are just way too involved these days. This phone has everything I could ever want in a CELL PHONE."	1

"One of the sleekest and most elite Android devices on the market. It has premium hardware with beautiful AMOLED screen, gorilla glass for scratch resistance and gets updates to all google apps and marketplace software quicker than any other device (including the EVO)!"	1
"One of the stereo speakers isn't  functioning, for it showed signs of being dropped. I'm sure it isn't the fault of the seller though. Other than that, it's a great device and it works.  (Edit: Turns out the ""speaker"" is actually a mic, research helps! Please disregard the complaint above.) "	1
One of the top rated cell phones by Consumer Reports.  Good screen size and not to big to still fit in pocket with lifeproof case. Other cases like otterbox will not slide in/out of pocket easily.	1
"One of the top smartphone on the market.   Excellent building materials, very bright display. This is nexus 4.

Good product.....I love nexus line"	1
"One of the worst decisions I've ever made.  $176 terribly spent. Att has proprietary phone numbers you can't remove from your phone list.  Forget about texting unless you're in a rest home and have all the time in the world.  Volume doesn't turn up high enough.  etc., etc., etc."	0

One phone is good and the second one is having problem	0
"One problem I had... the case for it interferes with the ear phone plug. I had to cut part out of the case in order to plug in the head phone plug. This port allows me to connect to my car stereo as well as a boombox that I use at my market booth. So that is not a knock on the iPhone, but a knock on the case makers. Sometimes I feel the apps and th e new new new iOS sucks... its not a Jobs iOS. not intuitive. Some things did not need fixing... and now I am lost in trying to get them to work. The volume of my iTunes are much lower... not use why. The volume limit is not on. I have to crank up the volume in the car and boombox. I can't find how to play the videos that used to easy to find and do. Installing Apps are mow a painful experience.... you did not need to fix it.. .Oh.. and two step verification is too quick... I need to have that window open longer. or why not have it open when I am typing it in... Hey I am 70 and still use my Amiga 2000..."	1
ONE RING TONE? ONE MESSAGE TONE? VERY BASIC PHONE FEATURES AND FEELS LIKE CHEAP PLASTIC IN THE HAND. I&amp;apos;M SURE FOPR THIS PRICE YOU CAN GET A MUCH BETTER PHONE....	0
"One thing I like about this phone is how user friendly it is to operate. I LOVE that you can sync music to your phone, creating your own ringtones. Easy keyboard to work with, clear photos, internet is easy to use. The only negative that I can think of, is sometimes the phone will shut itself down when you need a software upgrade. The phone will not prompt of this needed upgrade, but once you download the new software, the phone works great....until the next time."	1
one was the phone was a very good price .two is the plan on the phone is cheap.  i really recommend this phone to people is very handie and fix right in ur pocket.Also the feature on the phone are good.	1

"One week after I got the phone, I rated it 3 out of 5 stars. The next week, I lowered it to 2 stars. Here's the old review: ""Overall it's okay. Was sluggish and would freeze up starting from day 2. I've had it for a little over a week now, and apps like Instagram or Snapchat often crash or get incredibly slow. Camera is very laggy. Overall though, it gets the job done just fine for a decent price.  Reviewed last night and gave the product 3/5 stars. Then the charger stopped working just now, so I'm reducing the rating. I've had the phone about a week and a half.""  -----------------UPDATED  REVIEW----------------- I've now had this phone for about 2 months and it's just died on me. It won't turn on. It's also been very sluggish before it died. Please do not buy from this seller, even if you're looking to save money on a cheap and simple phone. I wasn't looking for anything fancy, just something that would work at a low cost. Clearly was a mistake."	0
"One wonderful phone por every day. One of the most interestings things is Only Nokia phones Dual sim  are relly DUAL with your handsfree, as my Parrot i9200 in my car, others like Samsung dual sim only work with bluetooh with 1 of the 2 SIM.  Extra long life battery."	1
one worked the other didn&apos;t work it came to me used and the buyer wanted me to send it back and do without a phone plus I had already paid to turn it on	0
"One works just fine a bit sluggish, the other one turns off randomly or even worse the screen freezes and I have to let the phone die out. ""New"" phones shouldn't act like this, very disapointed, should consider testing the phones before throwing any phone into the customer package and this happen to me on a different phone I bought on eBay I guess it very common. TEST YOUR PHONES BEFORE SHIPPING TO CUSTOMER!!!! Avoid ""phonestoreusa"" until they describe their phones as 100% tested."	0
"One would think that the seller would have placed Delivery Confirmation on an item that cost over $100. I have wasted my time and MONEY! The USPS is one of the worst ways to have a package delivered. Not only did this seller use USPS, they didn&apos;t get Delivery Conformation. Thanks A Lot!!!"	0

only because bought and was not as described.buyer beware I would not deal with this seller again. asked repeatedly about phone. cannot unlock was told seller did not get the money when seller did receive it. unprofessional. would have swapped for another product..	0
Only been 2 weeks but so far so good  satisfied customer	1
"Only bidded because it says bundle and clearly has pictures of two separate phones received the phone (only one) thought it must be a mistake contacted the seller and he replys ""As it clearly states in the listing ""blue and silver used"" which is what you received. Thanks for bidding!"" is that misleading or what!? Why would there be pictures of TWO phones with a description that states BUNDLE but the seller only intended to sell one phone. I wouldn't recommend buying from this seller."	0
Only complaints are battery life and every time s new software update is installed the phone runs a bit slower. (which makes sense. old hardware new software)... BESIDES FROM THAT THE PHONE IS AWWWWWSSOMEEEEE	1
Only gave one stare because that is the minimum.  Won't let me leave a negative star value.	0

"Only issue is battery life is short . I love my phone still, all the on screen tutorials helped lots and love the camera has a flash and Panoramic view to snap pics. I love the size and its lightweight but tough enough to stand a bump and drop. I would recommend this phone to friends and family. I am totally satisfied 100% with this smartphone."	1

Only one month too expensive 	0
only one thing I don&apos;t like...the apps (for my IP Camera&apos;s) at the windows store just don&apos;t compare to the Android market....that&apos;s disappointing because I really love the phone.  there is a slight learning curve but the phone has a lovely running system. Love the display screen and the different colors you can set it to.  It doesn&apos;t let me copy and paste from one email client to another (just couldn&apos;t figure it out). It&apos;s a very nice phone though.	1
"Only one thing. It is SO clear, worth every penny!!!!!!!!"	1
"Only replaced phone because puppy chewed it!!!    Simple, easy to use, has the &quot;perks&quot; I need.    Recommend if you are looking for a basic phone, though it does have many features that most folks would probably utilize."	1
only single sim is working	0
Only supports 2g and there is only a few places 2g still works in America.	0
"Only thing I miss from my other Razors are the quick commands, other than that a nice little phone, Thanks seller!"	1

Only wish it came with a sim card	1
Only worked 2 days.	0
"Only works on 2G and 3G.  2G is being phased out, so you're going to be limited.  NO battery, only an empty battery bag.  Still waiting for RMA.  Seller DID refund payment."	0

Order this htc m8 and didnt realize that can only get Windows apps ok but the unwillingness of seller to work with me on a return or even an exchange is a signal of a place i don't want to do business with.	0
"Order took 3 weeks from China and after 2 weeks of use, all buttons (including touchscreen) stopped working. Very dissatisfied and am very sceptical about purchasing on ebay again."	0

"Ordered an Alcatel Idol 4S with Windows in early July. The phone I got was supposed to be unlocked but wasn't. The seller first offered to reimburse me the cost of unlocking, and when I initially couldn't get it unlocked, offered me a full refund. Fortunately I was able to get it unlocked. The phone quality is much better than I could have ever expected. For a used model, there is not a scratch on it. Good value and a genuine pleasure to deal with."	1

A week after the purchase I still hadn't heard form them and finally waited till I could request a refund."	0
Ordered H831 as it has Android 8 Update. But received RS model with no capability to be updated. The Android version stays at 7 . The ad says it is 9/10 it was really 7/10 and wasnt the latest version. Returned the phone and seller didnt even bother apologizing for sending lower quality and different model! They do business with your money until you return it!	0

"Ordered on basis of reviews. Definitely meets/exceeds my needs. Had old LG that was acting up.As a senior citizen in rural location, missed and dropped calls with the old LG. I just want basic phone - not all the frills and fancy stuff although this one has access to much more than I need. From NO bars with the old LG to 2 with antenna in and 3 with extended with the E-815. Exactly what I wanted/needed!"	1

ordered what was supposed to be a new gleam. You could not hear me talking when I received a call. battery only lasted about 6 to 8 hours before dying without being used.

Would not buy another one.	0

"Our family had two x426 phones for about a year, and we loved them.      The first things we admired about them was their compact, clean style and solid feel.  Their beautiful color display and clear reception were a welcome bonus.      All that&apos;s very nice, but what we really wanted to know was -- do they work?    We found the x426 phones to be very reliable with excellent battery life.  The buttons are easy to use, and the menus are simple to navigate.  The phones are well designed, small enough to fit in your pocket, and look great.  The displays are bright and colorful, and the sound quality is excellent -- we never had any reception problems whatsoever.      We loved that the x426 phones are completely customizable.  We uploaded our own wallpapers, set secure passwords, and assigned ring tones to specific numbers and/or groups.  The programmable directional pad came in handy for instantly accessing the calendar, alarm, call records, and calculator (just about any function can be programmed here).  I used the alarm to alert me for eBay auctions quite a bit, and the To Do List became invaluable to me.  **There are many other features, too many to describe here, but the 500 name phone book, call waiting, caller ID, and alerts (sound and vibrate) worked flawlessly and are all worth mentioning.    The manual is clearly written, nicely cross-referenced, and it&apos;s a nice, small size that will tuck away in the smallest drawer.  The AC adapters are also small enough to store easily, and they completely charge fully depleted batteries in about an hour.  Battery life for these phones is exceptional.  The batteries still held the same strong charge as when new, and, in our case, the batteries lasted 2-3 days without a charge.    Our single, very minor complaint was the ridiculously small rubber protectors for the phones&apos; AC adapter connections, sort of tiny plugs at the foot of the phones.  These silly things are about 1/8&quot; W x 1/2&quot; L, and, unless you have ESP, you&apos;ll lose them straight away.  Wrestling the protectors in and out every time we needed to charge the phones was annoying, so we stored the plugs and used the phones without them.    Of note, the x426 is preloaded with some questionable ring tones, but downloading ring tones of your choice quickly resolves this.  The wallpapers are animated, and most are acceptable.  However, personalized wallpapers are easily uploaded to the x426 with a Samsung Serial Data Cable.  Software for creating wallpapers is a free download from Samsung (as of this writing).    The x426 phone is an excellent choice for teens or first time cell phone users because it&apos;s so simple to use.  If there&apos;s ever a question, the User Guide is very understandable and quick to reference.  Further, the phone&apos;s many features are easily accessed and can be personalized to the user.  And, many organizations, like secure workplaces, do not allow cell phones with cameras, and these phones meet that requirement.    Overall, we were very pleased with the performance of the x426 phones and the accessories.  We had no problems at all.      In fact, the x426 phones impressed us so much that when we signed a new service contract, we opted for the x427m phones -- the x426 twins.  You just can&apos;t go wrong with a full-featured phone that&apos;s stylish, dependable, and simple to use.      **We didn&apos;t use the WAP 2.0 Web Browser (mMode), but this internet option is available (text messaging, etc.).  Java games are preloaded, but we only explored these once or twice."	1
Our Grandson had one like this so we thought it would be nice to have.  We received the phone long before they said we would receive the package.  Would order from this person again.	1

Outstanding  phone for the price.     	1
"Outstanding condition, fast delivery, even though it did not come with an OEM charger the 3rd party charger was very good with capability to charge 2 devices at the same time."	1
Outstanding ebayer will do business again. 	1
"Outstanding phone with only one exception - the battery.  Dies very quickly.  Despite that, the phone is outstanding...wait I said that already.  To make things even better, the seller was outstanding as well...."	1
Outstanding product.  Even though it was pre-owned it looks brand new and has a larger screen then the original Droid Maxx. 	1
"Outstanding quality phone, for a reasonable price. The pictures and videos have such clarity, even though there&apos;s no flash. The storage is descent, but get a SD card for needed space. Battery life is extensive (which is good for long days without a charger). The phone receives a full charge within a hour from 0%-60% or 100%.       Cons:  The touchscreen is extremely sensitive. Samsung Galaxy Legend has no flash, but a phone editor will brighten the photos if needed, once the photo-editor app it downloaded from PLAY STORE."	1
Outstanding!. Item just as described. Fast shipping. Excelent communication.  Thank you. Hope to do business with you in the future	1
"Outstandingly good! Very user friendly.  Works great! Siri is wonderful, size is great, sound quality is good and has an awesome camera."	1
Over all I like the phone. It seems a little slow. Battery life is good for one 10hr working day. If not used alot. It is very durable.	1
"over all performance is better then earlier verson, need more improvements,blue tooth connection is slow rest is ok."	1
Over all this is a good phone and it have plenty of space.	1
"Over Christmas I somehow smashed my Samsung &apos;phone and it had given me such good service I decided that Samsung was the only replacement.  However although the phone looked the same it was somehow not the same .The space key had moved from the bottom right hand corner to the top sliding part,I am getting used to it now but if Samsung think this is an improvement then they are wrong.Also when I send a message I get no aknowledgement that it has been delivered just a nasty clunk to say it has been sent.Perhaps I should have paid more and taken more time in choosing a replacement but I just assumed that with it being the same brand all the functions would have been the same.Would I recommend it to a friend .....no!"	0
"Over priced,phone had lock on and when I called I found them un-helpful. Don&apos;t buy anything from these people."	0
Overall  Does everything needed and functions smoothly	1
"Overall a solid phone for the price.  It does everything I tell it to and it hardly shrugs its shoulders.  It's a great device for even light gaming.      No NFC or wireless charging.  I do miss NFC, but I'll get a watch with that feature if I need it that badly.  Wireless charging is a whatever feature for me so I don't mind it's old fashioned micro-usb port.     Has no issues with Samsung brand micro sd cards.  Have not tried other brands.    Strong cellular and wifi signal for price."	1
"Overall came in good condition,  no complaints "	1
Overall excellent experience!  A great value.  Product was received quickly and in perfect condition.	1
"Overall excellent... If you&apos;re not one of those people who feels like you need a phone the size of a computer screen, you probably won&apos;t find a better phone, hardware-wise.  The o.s. Is a bit buggy, but that&apos;s the price you pay to support the un-supported I guess..."	1
"Overall General Phone And Features Was Very Nice, However, Model I Ordered Had No Working Volume, Thus, Defective..Item Sent Back For Refund."	0
Overall Good Phone Like The Camera and texting. but the touch is too sensitive. but its OK.. really liking this phone	1
"Overall good shape as described, but battery life isnt too good - probably needs to be changed out as part of Apple replacement program."	1
overall great phone  i upgraded from an older 8330 model which i thought was good but now realize was horrible compared to this one	1
Overall I know its a good phone its just that when I received the phone it didn't work. It kept freezing up on the start up screen..	0
Overall I received my phone 2 days before the expected date	1
Overall I'm already searching for another phone. The rear camera has a auto focus problem it won't focus and repeatedly focus in and out in and out. I replaced the rear lens along with the cover and cleaned the camera with my dslr cleaning kit still I could not get the rear camera to stay in focus. I just want to take nice pictures and shoot in 4k but every thing ends up blurry. And not to mention when the battery gets to about 20% it will restart the phone  over and over not fully starting up but continuly restarting it self until the phone  says there is 0% and needs to be plugged up. I have to reboot the phone in safe mode for it to stop and clear cache. Ughhhhh 	0
overall it was good.	1
Overall not a useful device. Poor material an software. Just a basic phone with nostorage. Would not recommend	0
Overall pretty pleased with the product. 	1
"Overall the functions of the phone are as stated, good.  The crack in the armor is that the battery life is poor.  It appears that the battery is in the early stages of needing replacement. I feel that the battery should have been replaced prior to  sale.  The two (2) star rating is being a bit generous in this case.A.D"	0
Overall the phone has been great! The company I purchased this phone from was awesome and the shipping was super fast!	1
"Overall the phone itself is amazing and the feel is great. The seller shipped me a phone with a replacement screen that was defective. Needless to say it stopped working, and now they are not taking any responsibility.   The phone itself is near perfect. Just wish the seller had scruples.   For the seller - All I want is to ship in my phone and receive a replacement. I already offered shipping overnight to you. I will take down this review once we talk."	0
Overall the physical look of the phone is really good but it has the WORST burn in. I can tell that whoever had this phone last left it open on Snapchat a lot from how bad the burn in is.	0
Overall this phone is likely quite a good phone but the bottom line is that the phone has MAJOR touchscreen issues. Imagine trying to type a text message and it is like another person is typing at the same time and messing up everything you do. The phone is almost unusable. I have only had it for a few months and I am ready to throw it out. 	0
Overall this was an excellent purchase my only concern is that the battery life is a bit short compared to my old Samsung Note II.	1
"Overall, a good model! Batareja ensure sufficient capacity in the standby mode, the video and audio mode, lacking some of its strength! Games and radio active labi.Mnuss, quite often take a screen calibration. Problem is the back cover seems to be a little bit loose.  I bought, because this model provides a good relationship between price and capabilities.    Sincerely,  Juris Tarvds"	1
"Overall, I am pleased with my purchase. The phone everything and more than expected. Quick, long lasting, and beautiful to look at from any angle."	1
"Overall, nice phone. The writing feature is great if you are in a quiet setting and don't want to use the voice command or type. Good for taking notes. Both the writing features and voice features work very well."	1
Overheating and poor battery life maybe im not lucky but i got this phone with defects.	0
Overheating. When i first was setting up this phone it was updating and started to overheat badly (and i wasn't charging it) i had to disable so many of my phones apps and some of their functions just to stop it from overheating and draining my battery. I paid 500 i wouldn't think id have this issue. 	0
overpriced for the value	0
"Owned this phone for several months (before I knew any better). Only good thing about it is the battery life and service coverage.  However, even for the price of just the phone, it&apos;s not a good bargain...but for the price of service, it&apos;s just a blatant rip-off. (I tried moving to Straight Talk&apos;s BYOP plan with this phone, but data wouldn&apos;t work due to a lock by Verizon).     There&apos;s no querty keyboard, no music player, horrible internet, micro screen and even simple 2D games would barely work (btw, verizon charges $10 per game on non-android phones), etc.    Some decent Android phones are selling for $20 these days.  Even at that price, the specs are light years better...and the games are free."	0
Owner backed out on the sale	0
Owner said that he saw somwthing above the screen and I did not think that he would mean that it's not taking commands. I replaced the screen and the same issue exists. I now have a $$ paperweight	0
"Package arrived fast with no problems and delays. I experienced some problems setting up the phone, but the seller helped me with all the process. I'll definitely make business with him again."	1
Package got here fast. Ordered Friday and wasn&apos;t supposed to arrive til Tuesday. And I received it Monday. Very friendly and helpful would love to do business with them again. Description was right on the money.	1
Package got very fast and in very good conditions.	1
Package is as expected.	1
Package was given the same way it was written. A pleasure doing business with. Would definitely recommend! 	1

Paid $50 for this used. It came in really good shape. This is actually my third one the first 2 were actually stolen and sold on eBay so beware and check ESN #s. I love the screen and gives great picture and video. Internet works great. Pretty comfortable in the hand to hold. Its a really attractive phone for the price.  If this one broke I would buy another one of the same exact phone. 	1

Palm Treo 700wx of Telus is a smartphone which fontionne under Windows Mobile 5. It is expensive qand same but can be very interesting for somebody who absolutely want Palm with the Mobile advantage of Microsoft Windows 5.  Are screen is very interesting and Palm Treo 700wx is a very solid apparatus. The keyboard is also very well concu. Bleutooth connection is also present what makes it possible to use an ear-phone without wire. The Operating system is also an advantage since Wndows Mobile 5 offer several options very interesting.  Are price is nevertheless to raise considering the absance WiFi connection. Are poid is enough to raise what can quickly become awkward.	1
"Panasonic G70 is my favorite phone. I love it for some very special features  another phones do not have.    One of the features is the special mirror screen. Once the internal backlight is off, the screen turns into a mirror, so I can do my make-up.     Second, it has included a Biorhythm Calendar, which, once I enter my birthdate, it provides me with my emotional, physical, and intellectual state.     Third, the G70 features a clip in the top, which allows me to attach it to my bag.     Everyone stops to take notice of my Panasonic G70."	1

"Pantech clearly needs a little more development time before they are ready to market a phone with the purported capabilities of the Pantech C150.      The first problem is the little joystick button centered under the screen.  You have to scroll it up, down, right, or left to scroll through the menus.  If you push it straight down in the process, you&apos;ve connected to the internet.  (ka-ching!)  You can&apos;t reprogram the buttons.  It&apos;s also a fragile little button, meant only for delicate fingers.    Problem two surfaces when you receive a call.  You can&apos;t hear most of the ring-tones if you have the phone in a pouch, pocket, or purse.  You can set the phone to ring and vibrate at the same time, which helps, but, for the most part,  you&apos;d better have the phone pasted to your body and make everyone around you is quiet just in case you get a call.    The third problem that we found irritating is the battery life.  On the most minimal settings, we got about 8 hours of standby time before the phone needed to be charged.  If you used the phone to talk, that time decreased.  If you used bluetooth, it lagged in transfer and sucked the life out of the Pantech C150.    The keypad lock did not manage to protect from that joystick button connecting to the internet while in a pouch.  (ka-ching!) The security lock even managed to work itself into entering a PUK code while in a pouch, as well. (ka-ching!)    The quality of the photographs are minimal, although you can set the pixel to two different settings.  The movie mode (look out battery) is not superb, either.    I might have thought, seeing all of the other ratings, that I had a bad phone.  It couldn&apos;t be, however, because we have two of them.  I doubt they were both equally sub-par.    In short, it&apos;s cute.  That was the first thing that attracted me to the Pantech C150.  That&apos;s pretty much all we got."	0

"People can't hear me when I'm in call unless the phone is on speaker phone mode. Considering this phone is pretty much too old to be good for anything other than calls, text messages, and email, this is pretty disappointing. I'm sure this is something that this seller knew about, it's very obvious, but only after it happens a few times after you've already bought it and put cell service on it.   Pretty much a waste of money."	0
People couldnt hear me!!! I did return it	0
"People disregard this phone as being old. But it has Bluetooth, and it's thin and small in my pocket compared to today's huge phones. and with my SD card I have 500 megs of music and videos. Also my plan has no data charges where my friends pay hundreds for one phone and data, I pay $80 for five lines !   I bought this particular RAZR for a backup, since the cell stores only want to sell crap simple phones to get you to buy a cheap smart phone and a data plan, and a connection fee. no thanks, I'll keep buying these Motorola RAZRs "	1

Oh, and when the &apos;k&apos; or &apos;space bar&apos; button is pressed the phone shuts off and I have to put the password back in and go back to the text. Very annoying. This phone is JUNK!! Loved it at first. Then everything slowly started to shut down on it. I would never recommend this phone to anyone!!"	0

Be careful when buying back covers or extended battery cover Not all fit, check the notches on the back of new cover before buying, this phone only has one notch. Also be careful with hard plastic covers, the cheap ones don&apos;t fit,ask seller first.  I use this V3 as a replacement for my White LG chocolate battery life on that&apos;s is bad.    I also us a Moto Defy that I just love when I need wifi."	1

"Perfect size - big enough to be easy to use, and small enough to fit in your hand.  Designed when Moto was owned by Google, an excellent Android implementation without clumsy attempts to differentiate.  Came with KitKat, but easily updated to Lollipop for the latest features. The screen is super sharp, and made with Gorilla glass for rough use.  Bought it for Tracfone BYOP; a year of service is about $100, including texts, data and phone minutes."	1
"Perfect size for front pocket of jeans or shirt. Fast operations and gobs of storage room for photos and downloads. Widgets through MetroPCS go very smoothly. Bright screen with easy to see icons. Charges superfast but if you are on it a lot, as I am in my line of work, have a means to charge it during the day. Maybe an extended battery might do the trick?"	1
Perfect size for me and packed with plenty of power. The specs on this phone are pretty good. It has never lagged for me. Screen is really sharp and clear. Overall I think it is a great phone.	1
"Perfect size smartphone for taking notes and using as a phone.  These are the 2 things I do with the Core Prime, not internet or games.  I would like to now purchase a GSM Core Prime. "	1

"perfect! The Galaxy S 4 is Samsung&apos;s flagship device for 2013. The S 4 ups the ante of its predecessor thanks to a 5&quot; 1080p Super AMOLED display (PenTile 441 ppi), a pseudo octa-core Samsung Exynos 5410 or quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 (depending on region), 2 gigs of RAM, up to 64 gigs of storage, LTE connectivity, and a 2600 mAh battery. Furthermore, the device features additional features such as floating touch and a 13 MP shooter featuring a revamped camera interface. All this brute force is encased in 7.9 mm of Samsung&apos;s well known Hyperglaze plastic finish."	1
"Perfect! We love it...  Phone is not sold at retail anymore, so we're lucky to get this good deal:)) via eBay!"	1
"Perfect!! It very good phone! It was only locked frp, now I use it. "	1
"Perfect!!! AWESOME...It&apos;s hard to get better looking than the MOTOKRZR; the phone will turn heads (at least until everyone has one) and it looks like a $500 fashion accessory. Fortunately, it sells for a good deal less than that, though the price is a bit high for the phone&apos;s features. But this is more than a fashion accessory, and thankfully the KRZR performs well at its primary job: making and receiving calls. Call quality is excellent and the phone has good ergonomics and is easy to use..."	1
Perfect!!! it is perfectly described and actually much better than i thought. the physical look was amazing besides the crack as described. If it wasn&apos;t there i would of thought it was new!!! thank you for a great iPhone!!!	1
Perfect!. The best phone ever. I really like everything about this phone. There is no comparison with other phones.  You have to buy and try it.	1

"Performed basic functions well and looks nice, but the camera is not as good as advertised. Also, the GPS is virtually useless. It never worked, even on an open highway in the middle of town with clear skies. I read reviews of other people with the same complaint. The screen began malfuntioning after a few months, and now only half of it is visible. The phone is basically worthless now, and I'm trying to sell it for parts. Not sure if this problem is common or if I just got a bad one from the ebay seller."	0

"PERSONALLY I DO NOT LIKE THIS PHONE, TO HEAVY, KEYBOARD KEYS DIFFICULT TO SEE, ONLY LIGHT UP WHEN ITS DARK.  MECHANICALLY ITS CONSTANTLY FREEZING UP.  DONT BUY."	0
Personally i thought the phone was going to be nice at the moment i have a brand new v325 its a very nice phone and buying this phone which is the v265 pressured me to go look at the phones that was avaliable at the verizon wireless store.I found out that the v265 was discontinued and that the phone was giving away free with contracts so they wasnt really trying to make a profit on the phone. The phone that i bought off of ebay is sitting on my counter not being used i lost 30.00 into it when i got the phone the case was all sracthed up. I told myself everyone gets screwed over once or twice on buying something on ebay and i guess this is mine. Then i searched online for a new case for the whole phone i put it on and the phone looks nice but yet still not satsifying.	0

"Philihal94 posted an iPhone 6 for bid and a local pickup only. I followed the bid and stayed up until 2 am on March 31 2018 watching as I won the bid. I wrote him a message wanting to contact him and pay for the item. I also contacted eBay and explained how I had won and see if they had any contact info for him. They put in a request for his number but could not retrieve it because I hadnt paid for the item so I tried to pay for the phone but couldnt because his PayPal wasnt up to date, I finally received a message back from him around 8 pm and all it said was yea 200. Seems he wasnt satisfied with the amount I won it for and would only allow me to have it if I was to pay 200. 93$ more than what I won it for in all fairness. I gave every opportunity for the buy to happen the way it shouldve  and Im positive he understands how eBay works and he placed it on there knowing it could go for less cause he set the reserve. If he wanted 200 for it he should have posted on Facebook marketplace or craigslist and allow himself to achieve his 200$ goal for the phone. So if he places anything else for bid or anything at all to where you could purchase it any kind of way and you win it fair and square or want to buy what hes selling dont expect to get it especially if its not the am"	0

Phone battery life is terrible and it sucks it only last 3 hours maybe 4 hours and also the sound on the phone is terrible it has very low sound and is hard to hear anything I have to keep using headphones instead of listening out the iPhone speaker. The seller didnt mentioned any of these problems in the description at all	0
"Phone battery was tested at a local APPLE STORE and failed the test. It required battery replacement. Battery only holds 50% of charge when fully charged, it shows 100% charged but is actually only 50%. The test also showed a counting charging cycle equal to 1298. This shows how many time the phone was charged. How can you advertise a phone that requires new battery in ""great working conditions""? That's called false advertisement. Company are actually sued over this. I asked the seller to refund the amount of money necessary to replace the failing battery and he refused. This was a reasonable request. He deny it. We'll see what ebay MONEY BACK GUARANTEE will do about this."	0
"Phone broke after 8 days and only warranty/insurance they offer (for purchase, which I did) does not go into effect until 60 days after purchase.  They offered no assistance when the phone crapped out in less than ten days but more than 7.  I have no respect for this seller.  BUYER BEWARE!!!!"	0

Phone gets uncomfortably hot when using demanding apps. Phone constantly freezes and I have to do a hard reset to get it back on and battery drains with incredible speed. The phone does have it's good sides: display/camera is good and sound is great but all that without backup time is useless. If you don't mind getting a power bank to use with this phone as it can hardly go through a day with full charge then go for it else get another phone. I may have to return if the phone freezing persist. Did I mention that I use this phone on the Boost Mobile network.	0

Phone is being returned. Unfortunately Im on a business trip and have to wait until I get back.  Volume on speakers are irritatingly low so you cant hear the person youre talking to.  Speaker phone is low. Cant adjust it higher. If I have time on this trip Im going to take it to an Apple store.  Sprint store said its defective.  Thats makes me mad because it should have been quality checked before sending it out. Dont you agree?  What a pain.	0
"Phone is cheap, but could be even cheaper as it is made from bad quality of plastic all af it.  When i received it i had big problems with it&apos;s batteries. The phone turned on but when somebody called me it turned off so i couldn&apos;t use it. I contacted the seller and he told me i should send phone back in order to be fixed. I found out that it was just a battery problem and both batteries they sent me where faulty.  So they shipped me two better batteries and now phone works ok.  Greek menu is very badly translated.  I wouldn&apos;t buy it again, but seller behaved ok and solved my problem even though i had to wait about a month to be able to use it properly."	0

"Phone is great, I must have a qwerty board. I have had other BBT and I will say this one is slow and freezes often. Which is very disapointing. Not at all the sellers fault. Has to just be this blackberry. (bad luck) seller was great, the battery that came with the phone did not work and they sent another one out ASAP. All good here..."	1
"Phone is great, it has allot of internal space 1.8GB + 8GB SD card. Battery life is not that great, 1 day with medium use, 8 hours heavy use. 2 days standby or maybe more.    All in all is a great Android phone and probably the best with hardware keyboard.     Only problem I dint research before buying the phone is the 3G support. This phone supports 3G, but only the T-Mobile bands not the AT&amp;T bands even unlocked. There is 2 versions of this phone, one for T-Mobile called G2 and the other called HTC Desire Z. The Desire Z will support ATT 3G bands.      Good luck and happy shopping!"	1

"Phone is great, nice camera, easily rooted if you&apos;d like. You cant find a better spec&apos;d phone than this for the $200 range, great deal. I bought high capacity battery for $10 off ebay, after 10 hours of work and watching netflix on my breaks i have 60% left, not bad. My first time on T-mobile, this phone with 30 dollar plan, unlimited web, perfect for me. For some reason the phone would read 4g in the kitchen just fine, speed test reads 10 Megabit down! But when i go upstairs to my room the 4g drops and it tries to connect to Edge, which is slower than 56k where i am :(  fixed it by forcing the phone to read wcdma only, not gsm. Now it doesn&apos;t disconnect and try to reconnect over and over again. And i get 4g in my room, speed test reads 3 Megabit down which is still better than my old 3g phone. I&apos;m happy"	1
"Phone is great, screen is very vivid. The size of the display could have been a tad bit larger. Phone is very snappy and camera has improved. The battery life of the phone isn&apos;t as great as I was expecting. It lasted me on average about 5-6 hours each day which means I have to carry around the charger."	1

The plastic material, the gold plating are of quality that is seen in a 1-10 dollar store. I don't mind losing money here but never expected something to be of the cheapest quality. Will never buy again from the seller and I am selling the phone today at 10 times lesser the value I paid. Shipment is delayed for no reason.

Phone is still locked to Verizon. When I received my phone it wouldn't recognize my AT&T SIM. Said it required a Verizon SIM. Returned for full refund.	0
Phone is still on a lease with Sprint. An annoying message pops up every minute stating so. Sprint allowed me to activate it and use it still. I messaged gizmo about it and they gave me $25 for the inconvenience. $340 for a unpaid for leased phone is terrible. People are basically leasing them from sprint then selling them to gizmo. 	0

Phone is too outdated.  Unable to download anything.  This phone is good for just phone calls or texting.	0
"Phone is too small for efficient use. Lots of echoing- feedback-very poor sound. Its possible my phone was defective because so many other people like the model. I however was very disappointed and returned it after one week of frustration. I replaced it with &quot;prism&quot; which is in a similar price range, but in my opinion a significantly superior android for the money."	0

Phone is unusable. It was sold as Verizon when the seller knew it was Softbank locked to Japan. Also the seller had no idea what the phone was. I bought the phone as a 32GB Iphone 5s and it was a 16GB. Completely horrible experience.	0

Phone is very easy to used ans have a good battery.	1
Phone is very fancy &amp; expensive looking with the gold plating.  Dust gets trapped under the outer face and over the camera lens. This is very annoying.  Texting is good.  Very clear calls with crystal talk technology. Camera is poor quality.  The 2GB internal memory is good.	0
"Phone is very good with affordable price. It has almost all features i;e internet, wifi, maps, facebook, youtube. The only problem would be internal memory. It is 128MB which may be less to install many mobile applications. As of now i do not if we can install applications in memory card."	1
"Phone is very good. Very solidly built, and the camera is incredible. Battery life is huge. With moderate use to heavy use, I can take off charge in the morning and easily go 16 hours and STILL have around 30% battery left. Best of all, the bloatware on his phone is very limited leaving more rooms for apps that I want and use instead of apps I don't want and will never use. Downside is wireless charging is not part of the phone and there's no headphone jack. Have to use Bluetooth or a adapter. Overall, phone is great. Very fast, responsive, and well built. I'd say 4.5 stars. 5 if it had the headphone jack and supported wireless charging. "	1
Phone is very slow in response.  Battery didn't last long. Needed to be charged often . Minus the price which is d only good. It ends of being a Waste of money if u purchase.	0

"Phone looked in mint condition, after 3 weeks the screen died. Took it to Apple store to replace the screen which would cost 129. Apple replaced the screen, but the phone would not power up properly & so they offer to replace the phone with a new SE. But I had to trade in my current SE & pay 129. So I traded it and cut my losses, instead of going through the trouble of getting a refund. "	0

This is a problem since I don't have time to sit there holding the charger every time the battery is low. The phone came with full battery, so I have to assume the seller was aware the phone was very difficult to charge."	0

"Phone replaced a V571 that was accidentally drowned in a glass of ice tea. The condition of the phone was like a new one that had only been used a couple days and the price allowed me to continue my phone service without having to pay Cingular the price of a new phone. The V180 is a very nice phone that I can edit using the Motorola Mobile Phone Tools program and a generic usb cable that also works with my mp3 player and my digital camera. I have other Motorola models that also can be edited, uploading and downloading songs and pictures. The V180 plays mp3 ringtones as well."	1

"Phone seems okay except for the fact that the WiFi doesn't work, even after doing all available system updates and multiple resets. The WiFi connects, but is unusable.

"Phone truly is brand new & well worth the wait! Factory seals on the box, on the accessories; right down the plastic holding the power cord & the little pouch each piece is in within the box! Selling much cheaper than others, presumably for the lengthy shipping time, but to have a brand new one is a dream come true! PLUS the cost of the warranty from square trade went down significantly. The price I ended up paying for brand new + warranty was within $20 of a B grade refurb + warranty! I have loved this phone from the moment I got it.. Tech Land out there loves this phone... it may be old at this point, but it is still in high demand, clearly still pricing competitive to brand new stuff. Totally holds its own with a long battery life, 16mp camera, gorgeous display, large but comfortable to hold size.. it's fast, there isn't an app or program or process I've run across that I cannot do. Have had this phone & only this phone since it came out (I think) 5 years ago. Family who has newer generations often express their issues with their phones & missing the 4. Being able to remove the battery seems like a right almost.. I was shocked to hear that stopped occuring. Batteries have so many issues, it's such a simple fix, but puts people in a spot to need to send in phones over a battery"	1
"Phone turns off by itself, while I'm on the phone or using apps."	0
"Phone turns off randomly. Appears to be because of loose battery. Even when I get the battery to stay in, it drains unreasonably fast while the phone is on sleep, and the wi-fi turns off randomly as well. These issues seem to extend beyond the loose battery problem.  Initiated a return but they wanted me to pay for shipping.  I do not think I should be required to pay for shipping when they gave me a totally defective product.  Contacted the seller about this but it's been a few days and they haven't responded."	0
Phone turns on but does not recognize the sim card.  So it cannot work in net work.	0
Phone was a Christmas gift. I tried to charge but display would show Starting but never Charging. I left like that for several hours hoping it would work. I turned phone on and updated software and was able to make a call. I went back to use it again after an hour but it was turned off? I turned it back on but it did the same thing. I emailed company about my issue and Justin told me it could be battery and they would send me one to test. It never came. I emailed them two more times but no response. Phone got misplaced here in the house so now we cannot find it. Tried to call it but I am sure it turned itself off. $90 dollars down the drain.	0

"Phone was advertised as new other. Listed as in Overstock item. This was not at all true. Pulled up the menu and the phone had over 800 charge cycles on it. It was obviously a used phone. Seller offered to do a partial refund for which I requested $40 as a partial refund. A very reasonable request considering the phone had so many charge cycles on it. Seller then backed out of their offer. Then accused me a feedback blackmail, after they did not respond to me for days. I simply told them that I was not going to be able to leave positive feedback since they had sold me a used phone, then back out of what they had offered to do because of this."	0

I deleted ebay app from my phone so I don't fall in tour that trap ever again! Ebay you suck!"	0
Phone was never shipped!!!.  Transaction went on for 2 weeks.  Contacted the seller multiple times and he delivered empty promises.  Indicated he would give discount for inconvenience but never shipped the phone.  Claimed phone was lost in the mail and he was sending another one.  This never happened and he finally admitted that he did not have the phone.  Total waste of time and a total disappointment!  Awful experience!! 	0

IT was returned and I would most definatly not buy another one!"	0
Phone was VERY dirty upon opening package. Inside of headphone slot is filled with what looks like dirt and earwax mixed together. Taking out the battery there was a dead bug wedged near the speaker.

"Phone works fine, but the battery has an extremely short life.  The overall product is not much useable unless I buy a new battery.  My suggestion to cell phone buyers is not to buy a used cell phone unless it says the battery is like new or comes with an extra.  If not, assume the cost of a new battery.  I can&apos;t use this phone without having to charge every so often if I use the phone even for a short time.  I can only make a one or two calls."	0

"Phone works well and appears to be new condition- this phone comes with a brushed silver material backplate instead of the black rubbery material backplate on my previous K7- I prefer the non-slip black so I swapped the silver one out. Other than that this phone is a good deal and easily synced up with my old G7 to transfer phone #s, apps, etc. I simply transferred T-Mobile Sim card from old phone to new, restarted new phone and everything worked fine.I have always had great luck with LG phones."	1
Phone works well it is a gift so would not be able to say much. But the person that received the phone is an older person that needed to see the numbers well and that it was not any trouble to maneuver. So far so good... would recommended if looking for a phone that is basic and simple to work.	1

Phone wouldn't work. Ear speaker of phone with  incoming calls sounds like their in a pool of water. Wouldn't charge while phone was off. Kept giving me a moisture error message. And it got lost in the mail. Arrived almost 2 weeks later. I wasted money   and the seller has not responded to any of my messages  I'm not happy.

"Phone&apos;s ringer quit working within one week, only vibrates now. Despite several of my friends trying to correct it. Don&apos;t like the &quot;joy-stick&quot; navigator. Buy another phone even if it is 3 times the money. Aggravation not worth it."	0
"Phone, for the discounted price, can't be beat.  Does everything I need and runs flawlessly on MetroPCS."	1
"Phone, tablet, phablet---it&apos;s two in one. I wanted a large screen smartphone; that can couple as a tablet as well. This Sony phone has a 6.44&quot; screen....for half price from current iPhone.  Specs are amazing, and still current. Incredibly bright; great contrast ratio, 1080pHD which was important to me. Not oversaturated like Samsung, nor the heavy skin of Samsung.     Waterproof!"	1
"phone_sellar. you sold me, a Nokia 6 TA 1025 used, in which you put in the advertisement that had certain details such as scratches and scratches; but upon receiving the product, I find that the cell phone is sent in quite bad conditions, then I list the problems present at the time of inspection: - It has a noticeable fold on the right side next to the power button. - The glass of the screen in the upper right part is raised and with signs of poor quality repairs. - In the lower part, the glass is raised obstructing the home button and fingerprint. - Problems reading the fingerprint. - Charger inlet with a marked degree of wear. - The cable that brings the product is not suitable for that cell phone model, the cable that it carries is type C."	0
"Phone+lightning cable+charger comes in 2 zip lock bags. Not box, but zip lock bags. Missing earpods, missing pin to open SIM card slot. Glass has lots of scratches (not ""light"" imperfections). My 4-year old phone has NOWHERE near the amount of scratches. I bought other refurbished products in the past, and all of them are reconditioned to be like new, not like something that ""fell of the back of a truck"", if you know what I mean. "	0
"Phones are shipped from China to a handler in NY, who then ships them locally within US. Every single phone excelic.store sells is a counterfeit!"	0
Phones came quickly and were nicely packaged but were not AT&T phones as advertised. They were from a Japanese carrier. We did not have any problems with the return but was false advertising. 	0
"Phones description clearly said clean imei, yet Verizon says its listed stolen, cost me a whole day sorting it all out after listing my phone as stolen cause I put my sim card in it, asked for seller to refund,  and agrees ,but I got to pay for return shipping?. Why would I spend more money to a dishonest seller. I mean be truthful  and someone would bought and got it cleaned, or used for parts. Even asked if seller would pay for a imei clean , Nope, blacklisted imei, either stolen, bill wasnt paid on phone, still in payments,reported lost or it was an insurance deal that went bad. Either way I end up with a paperweight.  "	0
